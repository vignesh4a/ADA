let us forget . what matters it that we
 once reigned o'er happy realms of long ago
 and talked of love , and let our voices low
 and ruled for some brief sessions royally
 what if we sung , or laughed , or wept maybe
 it has availed not anything , and so
 let it go by that we may better know
 how poor a thing is lost to you and me
 but yesterday i kissed your lips , and yet
 did thrill you not enough to shake the dew
 from your drenched lids — and missed , with no regret
 your kiss shot back , with sharp breaths failing you
 and so , to day , while our worn eyes are wet
 with all this waste of tears , let us forget

the hills are gleaming brass , and bronze the peaks
 the mesas are a brazen , molten sea
 and e'en the heaven 's blue infinity
 undimmed by kindly cloud through arid weeks
 seems polished turquoise . like a sphinx she speaks
 the scornful desert : “ what would'st thou from me
 and in our hearts we answer her ; all three
 unlike , for each a different treasure seeks
 one sought adventure , and the desert gave
 his restless heart found rest beneath her sands
 one sought but gold . he dug his soul a grave
 the desert 's gift worked evil in his hands
 one sought for beauty ; him she made her slave
 turn back ! no man her ‘ witched gift withstands

when death , or adverse fortune 's ruthless gale
 tears our best hopes away , the wounded heart
 exhausted , leans on all that can impart
 the charm of sympathy ; her mutual wail
 how soothing ! never can her warm tears fail
 to balm our bleeding grief 's severest smart
 nor wholly vain feign 'd pity 's solemn art
 tho ’ we should penetrate her sable veil
 concern , e'en known to be assum 'd , our pains
 respecting , kinder welcome far acquires
 than cold neglect , or mirth that grief profanes
 thus each faint glow worm of the night conspires
 gleaming along the moss 'd and darken 'd lanes
 to cheer the gloom with her unreal fires

and thou , o river of to morrow , flowing
 between thy narrow adamantine walls
 but beautiful , and white with waterfalls
 and wreaths of mist , like hands the pathway showing
 i hear the trumpets of the morning blowing
 i hear thy mighty voice , that calls and calls
 and see , as ossian saw in morven 's halls
 mysterious phantoms , coming , beckoning , going
 it is the mystery of the unknown
 that fascinates us ; we are children still
 wayward and wistful ; with one hand we cling
 to the familiar things we call our own
 and with the other , resolute of will
 grope in the dark for what the day will bring

yes ! i once bore that title , and my heart
 thought nobler of itself , that one so good
 so honor 'd , so rever 'd , should give it me
 o isola ! when that glad season comes
 which brought redemption to a ruin 'd world
 and , like thee , hides beneath the snow of age
 a gay , benevolent , and feeling heart
 i hop 'd again to hear thy tongue repeat
 with youthful warmth and zealous energy
 those passages , where poetry assumes
 an air divine , and wakes th ’ attentive soul
 to holy rapture ! then you promis 'd me
 the luxury to weep o'er dante 's muse
 and fair italia 's loftier poets hail

“ not all ” — the echoes answer me — “ not all
 “ prophetic sounds and loud , arise forever
 “ from us , and from all ruin , unto the wise
 “ as melody from memnon to the sun
 “ we rule the hearts of mightiest men — we rule
 “ with a despotic sway all giant minds
 “ we are not impotent — we pallid stones
 “ not all our power is gone — not all our fame
 “ not all the magic of our high renown
 “ not all the wonder that encircles us
 “ not all the mysteries that in us lie
 “ not all the memories that hang upon
 “ and cling around about us as a garment
 “ clothing us in a robe of more than glory

my frail and earthly bark , by reason 's guide
 which holds the helm , whilst will doth wield the sail
 by my desires , the winds of bad betide
 hath sailed these worldly seas with small avail
 vain objects serve for dreadful rocks to quail
 my brittle boat from haven of life that flies
 to haunt the sea of mundane miseries
 my soul that draws impressions from above
 and views my course , and sees the winds aspire
 bids reason watch to scape the shoals of love
 but lawless will enflamed with endless ire
 doth steer empoop , [ b ] whilst reason doth retire
 the streams increase ; love 's waves my bark do fill
 thus are they wracked that guide their course by will

“ my eyes were blind with passion as i read
 i tore the letter into bits and stamped
 upon them , ground my teeth and cursed the day
 i met her , to be jilted . all that night
 my thoughts ran riot . round the room i strode
 a raving madman — savage as a sioux
 then flung myself upon my couch in tears
 and wept in silence , and then stormed again
 ‘ beggar ! ’ — it raised the serpent in my breast
 mad pride — bat blind . i seized her pictured face
 and ground it under my heel . with impious hand
 i caught the book — the precious gift she gave
 and would have burned it , but that still small voice
 spake in my heart and bade me spare the book

“ were man indeed the only hope of man
 i never would reprove thee for thy tears
 but , they are vain ! man has a surer trust
 the helpless , weary , miserable wretch
 left by his fellows in the wilderness
 shall be supported in that trying hour
 by a right arm , which , in his days of strength
 he did not lean upon ! a gracious arm
 which wounds the sick , and heals them by the stroke
 o ! lora ! to the father of the world
 a judge so patient and so merciful
 that he refuses not the latest sigh
 nor suffers sorrow but as means to save
 canst thou not trust the objects of thy care

she back four paces drew , at first , through shame
 then , led by love , eight others forward came
 but scruples still arose that ardour foiled
 and nearly ey'ry thing had truly spoiled
 anne had a conscience pure as holy fire
 but how could she abstain from soft desire
 if , in the bosom chance a flame should raise
 is there a pow'r can then subdue the blaze
 at first these inclinations she withstood
 but doubting soon , how those of flesh and blood
 could sins commit by stepping in advance
 she took her seat upon the green expanse
 and there attentively the lad observed
 with eyes that scarcely from him ever swerved

so shall i live , supposing thou art true
 like a deceived husband , so love 's face
 may still seem love to me , though altered new
 thy looks with me , thy heart in other place
 for there can live no hatred in thine eye
 therefore in that i cannot know thy change
 in many 's looks , the false heart 's history
 is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
 but heaven in thy creation did decree
 that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
 whate'er thy thoughts , or thy heart 's workings be
 thy looks should nothing thence , but sweetness tell
 how like eve 's apple doth thy beauty grow
 if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show

lift up your eyes ! behold these pictured walls
 look where the flood of western glory falls
 through the great sunflower disk of blazing panes
 in ruby , saffron , azure , emerald stains
 with reverent step the marble pavement tread
 where our proud mother 's martyr roll is read
 see the great halls that cluster , gathering round
 this lofty shrine with holiest memories crowned
 see the fair matron in her summer bower
 fresh as a rose in bright perennial flower
 read on her standard , always in the van
 “ truth , ” — the one word that makes a slave a man
 think whose the hands that fed her altar fires
 then count the debt we owe our scholar sires

because i oft in dark abstracted guise
 seem most alone in greatest company
 with dearth of words , or answers quite awry
 to them that would make speech of speech arise
 they deem , and of their doom the rumour flies
 that poison foul of bubbling pride doth lie
 so in my swelling breast , that only i
 fawn on myself , and others do despise
 yet pride , i think , doth not my soul possess
 which looks too oft in his unflattering glass
 but one worse fault , ambition , i confess
 that makes me oft my best friends overpass
 unseen , unheard , while thought to highest place
 bends all his powers , even unto stella 's grace

some men i have beheld with wonderment
 noble in form and feature , god 's design
 in whom the thought must search , as in a mine
 for that live soul of theirs , by which they went
 thus walking on the earth . and i have bent
 frequent regard on women , who gave sign
 that god willed beauty , when he drew the line
 that shaped each float and fold of beauty 's tent
 but the soul , drawing up in little space
 thus left the form all staring , self dismayed
 a vacant sign of what might be the grace
 if mind swelled up , and filled the plan displayed
 each curve and shade of thy pure form were thine
 thy very hair replete with the divine

him , in his march , the wounded princes meet
 by tardy steps ascending from the fleet
 the king of men , ulysses the divine
 and who to tydeus owes his noble line
 ( their ships at distance from the battle stand
 in lines advanced along the shelving strand
 whose bay , the fleet unable to contain
 at length ; beside the margin of the main
 rank above rank , the crowded ships they moor
 who landed first , lay highest on the shore
 supported on the spears , they took their way
 unfit to fight , but anxious for the day
 nestor ’ s approach alarm ’ d each grecian breast
 whom thus the general of the host address ’ d

the hostess whispered him she thought her spouse
 again , my dear , such sparks let 's never house
 pray do n't you hear how they together chat
 just then the husband raised himself and sat
 is this your plan ? said he with mighty rage
 was it for this you would my house engage
 you understand me , but i 'll seek redress
 think you so very cheap to have success
 what , would you ruin families at will
 and with our daughters take at ease your fill
 away , i say ! my house this moment quit
 and as for you , abominable chit
 i 'll have your life : this hour you breathe your last
 such creatures only can with beasts be classed

through armes and vassals rome the world subdu 'd
 that one would weene that one sole cities strength
 both land and sea in roundnes had survew 'd
 to be the measure of her bredth and length
 this peoples vertue yet so fruitfull was
 of vertuous nephewes *, that posteritie
 striving in power their grandfathers to passe
 the lowest earth ioin 'd to the heaven hie
 to th'end that , having all parts in their power
 nought from the romane empire might be quight
 and that though time doth commonwealths devowre
 yet no time should so low embase their hight
 that her head , earth 'd in her foundations deep
 should not her name and endles honour keep

dost think that time , to whom stars vainly sue
 will for thy beauty keep one fix è d place
 or that he may , o'erhyppphenweighed with seasons due
 forget one spring where veinlet tendrils lace
 rose over rose to make this flower , thy face
 look round thee now , dear dupe of sweet hey day
 of what once blooming joy canst thou find trace
 save in the bosom of a cold decay
 what violet of summer 's yester sway
 usurps these clouds to throne her slender moon
 look on the wrinkling year , the shrunken way
 the wintry bier of all that gaudy shone
 and gather love ere loveliness wear pall
 if thou , when all is gone , wouldst still have all

lady , thou weepest for the maniac 's woe
 and thou art fair , and thou , like me , art young
 oh ! may thy bosom never , never know
 the pangs with which my wretched heart is wrung
 i had a mother once — a brother too
 ( beneath yon yew my father rests his head
 i had a lover once , and kind and true
 but mother , brother , lover , all are fled
 yet , whence the tear which dims thy lovely eye
 oh ! gentle lady — not for me thus weep
 the green sod soon upon my breast will lie
 and soft and sound will be my peaceful sleep
 go thou , and pluck the roses while they bloom
 my hopes lie buried in the silent tomb

so in cheapside , what time aurora peeps
 a mingled noise of dustmen , milk , and sweeps
 falls on the housemaid 's ear : amazed she stands
 then opes the door with cinder sabled hands
 and “ matches ” calls . the dustman , bubbled flat
 thinks ‘ tis for him and doffs his fan tail 'd hat
 the milkman , whom her second cries assail
 with sudden sink unyokes the clinking pail
 now louder grown , by turns she screams and weeps  
 alas ! her screaming only brings the sweeps
 sweeps but put out — she wants to raise a flame
 and calls for matches , but ‘ tis still the same
 atoms and housemaids ! mark the moral true  
 if once ye go astray , no match for you

i must not grieve , my love , whose eyes would read
 lines of delight , whereon her youth might smile
 flowers have time before they come to seed
 and she is young , and now must sport the while
 and sport , sweet maid , in season of these years
 and learn to gather flowers before they wither
 and where the sweetest blossom first appears
 let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither
 lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air
 and calm the tempest which my sighs do raise
 pity and smiles do best become the fair
 pity and smiles must only yield thee praise
 make me to say , when all my griefs are gone
 happy the heart that sigh 'd for such a one

the soft west wind , returning , brings again
 its lovely family of herbs and flowers
 progne 's gay notes and philomela 's strain
 vary the dance of springtide 's rosy hours
 and joyously o'er every field and plain
 glows the bright smile that greets them from above
 and the warm spirit of reviving love
 breathes in the air and murmurs from the main
 but tears and sorrowing sighs , which gushingly
 pour from the secret chambers of my heart
 are all that spring returning brings to me
 and in the modest smile , or glance of art
 the song of birds , the bloom of heath and tree
 a desert 's rugged tract and savage forms i see

shall we , too , rise forgetful from our sleep
 and shall my soul that lies within your hand
 remember nothing , as the blowing sand
 forgets the palm where long blue shadows creep
 when winds along the darkened desert sweep
 or would it still remember , tho ’ it spanned
 a thousand heavens , while the planets fanned
 the vacant ether with their voices deep
 soul of my soul , no word shall be forgot
 nor yet alone , beloved , shall we see
 the desolation of extinguished suns
 nor fear the void wherethro ’ our planet runs
 for still together shall we go and not
 fare forth alone to front eternity

youth gone , and beauty gone if ever there
 dwelt beauty in so poor a face as this
 youth gone and beauty , what remains of bliss
 i will not bind fresh roses in my hair
 to shame a cheek at best but little fair
 leave youth his roses , who can bear a thorn
 i will not seek for blossoms anywhere
 except such common flowers as blow with corn
 youth gone and beauty gone , what doth remain
 the longing of a heart pent up forlorn
 a silent heart whose silence loves and longs
 the silence of a heart which sang its songs
 while youth and beauty made a summer morn
 silence of love that cannot sing again

what wrongs the oppressor suffered , these we know
 these have found piteous voice in song and prose
 but for the oppressed , their darkness and their woe
 their grinding centuries ,— what muse had those
 though hall and palace had nor eyes nor ears
 hardening a people 's heart to senseless stone
 thou knewest them , o earth , that drank their tears
 o heaven , that heard their inarticulate moan
 they noted down their fetters , link by link
 coarse was the hand that scrawled , and red the ink
 rude was their score , as suits unlettered men
 notched with a headsman 's axe upon a block
 what marvel if , when came the avenging shock
 ‘ twas at ë, not urania , held the pen

thou know'st how guiltless first i met thy flame
 when love approach 'd me under friendship 's name
 my fancy form 'd thee of angelic kind
 some emanation of the all beauteous mind
 those smiling eyes , attempering every ray
 shone sweetly lambent with celestial day
 guiltless i gazed ; heaven listen 'd while you sung
 and truths divine came mended from that tongue
 from lips like those , what precept fail 'd to move
 too soon they taught me ‘ twas no sin to love
 back through the paths of pleasing sense i ran
 nor wish 'd an angel whom i loved a man
 dim and remote the joys of saints i see
 nor envy them that heaven i lose for thee

flower of the desert , type mysterious , strange
 like bird or monster on some sculptured tomb
 in egypt 's curious fashion wrought , what change
 or odd similitude of fate , what range
 of cycling centuries from out the gloom
 of dusty ages has evolved thy bloom
 in the bleak desert of an alien zone
 child of the past , why dwellest thou alone
 grotesque , incongruous , amid the flowers
 unlovely and unloved , standing aside
 like to some rugged spirit sheathed in pride
 unsmiling to the sun , untouched by showers
 the dew falls — every bud has drunk its fill
 bloom of the desert , thou art arid still

‘ and then i came to seek thee in this cell
 to crucify my worldliness and pride
 to lay my heart 's affections all aside
 as carnal hindrances which held my soul
 from hasting unencumbered to her goal
 and all this have i done , or else have striven
 to do , obeying the behest of heaven
 and my reward is bitterness . i seem
 to wander always in a feverish dream
 on plains where there is only sun and sand
 no rock or tree in all the weary land
 my thirst unquenchable , my heart burnt dry
 and still in my parched throat i faintly cry
 deliver me , o lord : bow down thine ear

meanwhile the black ship on to scyros ran
 and those twain found before his palace gate
 achilles ’ son , now hurling dart and lance
 now in his chariot driving fleetfoot steeds
 glad were they to behold him practising
 the deeds of war , albeit his heart was sad
 for his slain sire , of whom had tidings come
 ere this . with reverent eyes of awe they went
 to meet him , for that goodly form and face
 seemed even as very achilles unto them
 but he , or ever they had spoken , cried
 “ all hail , ye strangers , unto this mine home
 say whence ye are , and who , and what the need
 that hither brings you over barren seas

this medieval knight ( the legend saith
 for months would scarcely draw a sober breath
 but as his appetite grew more and more
 drank each day worse than on the day before
 was drunk all night , all day continued so
 indulged in every vice he chanced to know
 but long debauch and riotous excess
 reduce their strongest votaries to distress
 when nature can the strain no longer stand
 she chastens with a sure and irate hand
 so when the day of reckoning had come
 she smote with fever and delirium
 this valiant knight whom we have tried to paint
 a very slim foundation for a saint

but passion ambushed by the aerial shrine
 comes forth to dance , a hoofed obscenity
 his satyr 's dance , with laughter in his eye
 and cruelty along the scarlet line
 of his bright smiling mouth . all uncontrolled
 love 's rebel servant , he delights to beat
 the maddening quick dry rhythm of goatish feet
 even in the sanctuary , and makes bold
 to mime himself the godhead of the place
 he turns in terror from her trance calmed face
 from the white lidded languor of her eyes
 from lips that passion never shook before
 but glad in the promise of her sacrifice
 “ i give you all ; would that i might give more

a woman 's face with nature 's own hand painted
 hast thou the master mistress of my passion
 a woman 's gentle heart but not acquainted
 with shifting change as is false women 's fashion
 an eye more bright than theirs , less false in rolling
 gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
 a man in hue all hues in his controlling
 which steals men 's eyes and women 's souls amazeth
 and for a woman wert thou first created
 till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting
 and by addition me of thee defeated
 by adding one thing to my purpose nothing
 but since she pricked thee out for women 's pleasure
 mine be thy love and thy love 's use their treasure

three sang of love together : one with lips
 crimson , with cheeks and bosom in a glow
 flushed to the yellow hair and finger tips
 and one there sang who soft and smooth as snow
 bloomed like a tinted hyacinth at a show
 and one was blue with famine after love
 who like a harpstring snapped rang harsh and low
 the burden of what those were singing of
 one shamed herself in love ; one temperately
 grew gross in soulless love , a sluggish wife
 one famished died for love . thus two of three
 took death for love and won him after strife
 one droned in sweetness like a fattened bee
 all on the threshold , yet all short of life

while yet he spoke , impatient of delay
 he braced his sandals on , and strode away
 then from the heavens the martial goddess flies
 through the wild fields of air , and cleaves the skies
 in form , a virgin in soft beauty 's bloom
 skill 'd in the illustrious labours of the loom
 alone to ithaca she stood display 'd
 but unapparent as a viewless shade
 escaped telemachus ( the powers above
 seen or unseen , o'er earth at pleasure move
 the dogs intelligent confess 'd the tread
 of power divine , and howling , trembling , fled
 the goddess , beckoning , waves her deathless hands
 dauntless the king before the goddess stands

swept , clean , and still , across the polished floor
 from some unshuttered casement , hid from sight
 the level sunshine slants , its greater light
 quenching the little lamp which pallid , poor
 flickering , unreplenished , at the door
 has striven against darkness the long night
 dawn fills the room , and penetrating , bright
 the silent sunbeams through the window pour
 and she lies sleeping , ignorant of fate
 enmeshed in listless dreams , her soul not yet
 ripened to bear the purport of this day
 the morning breeze scarce stirs the coverlet
 a shadow falls across the sunlight ; wait
 a lark is singing as he flies away

then spake king arthur to sir bedivere
 ‘ far other is this battle in the west
 whereto we move , than when we strove in youth
 and brake the petty kings , and fought with rome
 or thrust the heathen from the roman wall
 and shook him through the north . ill doom is mine
 to war against my people and my knights
 the king who fights his people fights himself
 and they my knights , who loved me once , the stroke
 that strikes them dead is as my death to me
 yet let us hence , and find or feel a way
 through this blind haze , which ever since i saw
 one lying in the dust at almesbury
 hath folded in the passes of the world

new yeare , forth looking out of ianus gate
 doth seeme to promise hope of new delight
 and , bidding th'old adieu , his passed date
 bids all old thoughts to die in dumpish * spright
 and calling forth out of sad winters night
 fresh love , that long hath slept in cheerlesse bower
 wils him awake , and soone about him dight
 his wanton wings and darts of deadly power
 for lusty spring now in his timely howre
 is ready to come forth , him to receive
 and warns the earth with divers colord flowre
 to decke hir selfe , and her faire mantle weave
 then you , faire flowre ! in whom fresh youth doth raine
 prepare your selfe new love to entertaine

once did she hold the gorgeous east in fee
 and was the safeguard of the west : the worth
 of venice did not fall below her birth
 venice , the eldest child of liberty
 she was a maiden city , bright and free
 no guile seduced , no force could violate
 and , when she took unto herself a mate
 she must espouse the everlasting sea
 and what if she had seen those glories fade
 those titles vanish , and that strength decay
 yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
 when her long life hath reached its final day
 men are we , and must grieve when even the shade
 of that which once was great is passed away

thou on whose stream , ‘ mid the steep sky 's commotion
 loose clouds like earth 's decaying leaves are shed
 shook from the tangled boughs of heaven and ocean
 angels of rain and lightning ; there are spread
 on the blue surface of thine airy surge
 like the bright hair uplifted from the head
 of some fierce maenad , ev'n from the dim verge
 of the horizon to the zenith 's height
 the locks of the approaching storm . thou dirge
 of the dying year , to which this closing night
 will be the dome of a vast sepulchre
 vaulted with all thy congregated might
 of vapours , from whose solid atmosphere
 black rain , and fire , and hail will burst : o hear

fill me once more the foaming pewter up
 another board of oysters , ladye mine
 to night lucullus with himself shall sup
 these mute inglorious miltons are divine
 and as i here in slippered ease recline
 quaffing of perkins ’ entire my fill
 i sigh not for the lymph of aganippe 's rill
 a nobler inspiration fires my brain
 caught from old england 's fine time hallowed drink
 i snatch the pot again and yet again
 and as the foaming fluids shrink and shrink
 fill me once more , i say , up to the brink
 this makes strong hearts — strong heads attest its charm
 this nerves the might that sleeps in britain 's brawny arm

“ the angels , o my brother ! and this clime
 wherein thou art , impassible and pure
 i call created , as indeed they are
 in their whole being . but the elements
 which thou hast nam 'd , and what of them is made
 are by created virtue ’ inform 'd : create
 their substance , and create the ’ informing virtue
 in these bright stars , that round them circling move
 the soul of every brute and of each plant
 the ray and motion of the sacred lights
 with complex potency attract and turn
 but this our life the ’ eternal good inspires
 immediate , and enamours of itself
 so that our wishes rest for ever here

nature made every fop to plague his brother
 just as one beauty mortifies another
 but here 's the captain that will plague them both
 whose air cries , arm ! whose very look 's an oath
 the captain 's honest , sirs , and that 's enough
 though his soul 's bullet , and his body buff
 he spits fore right ; his haughty chest before
 like battering rams , beats open every door
 and with a face as red , and as awry
 as herod 's hangdogs in old tapestry
 scarecrow to boys , the breeding woman 's curse
 has yet a strange ambition to look worse
 confounds the civil , keeps the rude in awe
 jests like a licensed fool , commands like law

the doors are all wide open ; at the gate
 the blossomed lilacs counterfeit a blaze
 and seem to warm the air ; a dreamy haze
 hangs o'er the brighton meadows like a fate
 and on their margin , with sea tides elate
 the flooded charles , as in the happier days
 writes the last letter of his name , and stays
 his restless steps , as if compelled to wait
 i also wait ; but they will come no more
 those friends of mine , whose presence satisfied
 the thirst and hunger of my heart . ah me
 they have forgotten the pathway to my door
 something is gone from nature since they died
 and summer is not summer , nor can be

they rested there that night . next morn they rose
 and to the ford of battle forward came
 that day a great , ill favoured , lowering cloud
 upon ferdiah 's face cuchullin saw
 “ badly , ” said he , “ dost thou appear this day
 ferdiah , for thy hair has duskier grown
 this day , and a dull stupour dims thine eyes
 and thine own face and form , and what thou wert
 in outward seeming have deserted thee
 “ ‘ tis not through fear of thee that i am so
 ferdiah said , “ for erin doth not hold
 this day a champion i could not subdue
 and thus betwixt the twain this speech arose
 and thus cuchullin mourned and he replied

at ephesus , in former times , once shone
 a fair , whose charms would dignify a throne
 and , if to publick rumour credit ‘ s due
 celestial bliss her husband with her knew
 naught else was talked of but her beauteous face
 and chastity that adds the highest grace
 from ev'ry quarter numbers flocked to see
 this belle , regarded as from errors free
 the honour of her sex , and country too
 as such , old mothers held her up to view
 and wished their offspring 's wives like her to act
 the sons desired the very same in fact
 from her , beyond a doubt , our prudes descend
 an ancient , celebrated house , depend

but as thou camest forth to bring the poor
 whose hearts are nearer faith and verity
 spiritual childhood , thy philosophy
 so taught'st the a b c of heavenly lore
 because thou sat'st not lonely evermore
 with mighty truths informing language high
 but , walking in thy poem continually
 didst utter deeds , of all true forms the core
 poet and poem one indivisible fact
 because thou didst thine own ideal act
 and so , for parchment , on the human soul
 didst write thine aspirations — at thy goal
 thou didst arrive with curses for acclaim
 and cry to god up through a cloud of shame

with simple gladness met him on the road
 his gray haired father — elder brother now
 few words were spoken , little welcome said
 but , as they walked , the more was understood
 if with a less delight he brought him home
 than he who met the prodigal returned
 it was with more reliance , with more peace
 for with the leaning pride that old men feel
 in young strong arms that draw their might from them
 he led him to the house . his sister there
 whose kisses were not many , but whose eyes
 were full of watchfulness and hovering love
 set him beside the fire in the old place
 and heaped the table with best country fare

lo ! the year 's final day !— nature performs
 its obsequies with darkness , wind , and rain
 but man is jocund .— hark ! th ’ exultant strain
 from towers and steeples drowns the wintry storms
 no village spire but to the cots and farms
 right merrily , its scant and tuneless peal
 rings round !— ah ! joy ungrateful !— mirth insane
 wherefore the senseless triumph , ye , who feel
 this annual portion of brief life the while
 depart for ever ?— brought it no dear hours
 of health and night rest ?— none that saw the smile
 on lips belov 'd ?— o ! with as gentle powers
 will the next pass ?— ye pause !— yet careless hear
 strike these last clocks , that knell th ’ expiring year

then the soul of the leper stood , up in his eyes
 and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he
 remembered in what a haughtier guise
 he had flung an alms to leprosie
 when he girt his young life up in gilded mail
 and set forth in search of the holy grail
 the heart within him was ashes and dust
 he parted in twain his single crust
 he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink
 and gave the leper to eat and drink
 ‘ t was a moldy crust of coarse brown bread
 ‘ t was water out of a wooden bowl
 yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed
 and ‘ t was red wine he drank with his thirsty soul

be still . the hanging gardens were a dream
 that over persian roses flew to kiss
 the curled lashes of semiramis
 troy never was , nor green skamander stream
 provence and troubadour are merest lies
 the glorious hair of venice was a beam
 made within titian 's eye . the sunsets seem
 the world is very old and nothing is
 be still . thou foolish thing , thou canst not wake
 nor thy tears wedge thy soldered lids apart
 but patter in the darkness of thy heart
 thy brain is plagued . thou art a frighted owl
 blind with the light of life thou'ldst not forsake
 and error loves and nourishes thy soul

no servile tenets would admittance find
 destructive of the rights of humankind
 of power divine , hereditary right
 and non resistance to a tyrant 's might
 for sure that all should thus for one be cursed
 is but great nature 's edict just reversed
 no moralists then , righteous to excess
 would show fair virtue in so black a dress
 that they , like boys , who some feigned sprite array
 first from the spectre fly themselves away
 no preachers in the terrible delight
 but choose to win by reason , not affright
 not , conjurors like , in fire and brimstone dwell
 and draw each moving argument from hell

upon my word , replied another fair
 if he were mine , i openly declare
 to judge from what so pleasantly you say
 i 'd make a present of him new year 's day
 for pleasure never gives me full delight
 unless a little pain the bliss invite
 no doubt your husband moves as he is led
 thank heav'n a different mortal claims my bed
 to take him in , great nicety we need
 but howsoe'er , at times i can succeed
 the satisfaction doubly then is felt
 in fond emotion bosoms freely melt
 with neither of you , husband or gallant
 would i exchange , though these so much you vaunt

but wherefore do not you a mightier way
 make war upon this bloody tyrant time
 and fortify your self in your decay
 with means more blessed than my barren rhyme
 now stand you on the top of happy hours
 and many maiden gardens yet unset
 with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
 much liker than your painted counterfeit
 so should the lines of life that life repair
 which this ( time 's pencil ) or my pupil pen
 neither in inward worth nor outward fair
 can make you live your self in eyes of men
 to give away your self , keeps your self still
 and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill

bride of the shark , her valour first i sing
 who on the lone seas quickened of a king
 she , from the shore and puny homes of men
 beyond the climber ’ s sea discerning ken
 swam , led by omens ; and devoid of fear
 beheld her monstrous paramour draw near
 she gazed ; all round her to the heavenly pale
 the simple sea was void of isle or sail
 sole overhead the unsparing sun was reared
 when the deep bubbled and the brute appeared
 but she , secure in the decrees of fate
 made strong her bosom and received the mate
 and , men declare , from that marine embrace
 conceived the virtues of a stronger race

now on a bier the persian warriors place
 the breathless youth , and shade his pallid face
 and turning from that fatal field away
 move towards the champion 's home in long array
 then rustem , sick of martial pomp and show
 himself the spring of all this scene of woe
 doomed to the flames the pageantry he loved
 shield , spear , and mace , so oft in battle proved
 now lost to all , encompassed by despair
 his bright pavilion crackling blazed in air
 the sparkling throne the ascending column fed
 in smoking fragments fell the golden bed
 the raging fire red glimmering died away
 and all the warrior 's pride in dust and ashes lay

how darkly o'er yon far off mountain frowns
 the gather 'd tempest ! from that lurid cloud
 the deep voiced thunders roll , aweful and loud
 tho ’ distant ; while upon the misty downs
 fast falls in shadowy streaks the pelting rain
 i never saw so terrible a storm
 perhaps some way worn traveller in vain
 wraps his torn raiment round his shivering form
 cold even as hope within him ! i the while
 pause me in sadness tho ’ the sunbeams smile
 cheerily round me . ah that thus my lot
 might be with peace and solitude assign 'd
 where i might from some little quiet cot
 sigh for the crimes and miseries of mankind

“ shall then no more , o sire of gods ! be mine
 the rights and honours of a power divine
 scorn 'd e'en by man , and ( oh severe disgrace
 by soft phaeacians , my degenerate race
 against yon destined head in vain i swore
 and menaced vengeance , ere he reach 'd his shore
 to reach his natal shore was thy decree
 mild i obey 'd , for who shall war with thee
 behold him landed , careless and asleep
 from all the eluded dangers of the deep
 lo where he lies , amidst a shining store
 of brass , rich garments , and refulgent ore
 and bears triumphant to his native isle
 a prize more worth than ilion 's noble spoil

“ great is the profit ( thus the god rejoin ’ d
 when ministers are blest with prudent mind
 warn ’ d by thy words , to powerful jove i yield
 and quit , though angry , the contended field
 not but his threats with justice i disclaim
 the same our honours , and our birth the same
 if yet , forgetful of his promise given
 to hermes , pallas , and the queen of heaven
 to favour ilion , that perfidious place
 he breaks his faith with half the ethereal race
 give him to know , unless the grecian train
 lay yon proud structures level with the plain
 howe ’ er the offence by other gods be pass ’ d
 the wrath of neptune shall for ever last

4 . if thine open hand hath relieved distress
 if thy pity hath sprung to wretchedness
 if thou hast forgiven the sore offense
 and humbled thy heart with penitence
 if nature 's voices have spoken to thee
 with her holy meanings eloquently
 if every creature hath won thy love
 from the creeping worm to the brooding dove
 if never a sad , low spoken word
 hath pled with thy human heart unheard
 then `, when the night steals on , as now
 it will bring relief to thine aching brow
 and , with joy and peace at the thought of rest
 thou wilt sink to sleep on thy mother 's breast

but to pursue my tale ; to welcome home
 his warlike brother is pirithous come
 arcite of thebes was known in arms long since
 and honour 'd by this young thessalian prince
 theseus , to gratify his friend and guest
 who made our arcite 's freedom his request
 restored to liberty the captive knight
 but on these hard conditions i recite
 that if hereafter arcite should be found
 within the compass of athenian ground
 by day or night , or on whate'er pretence
 his head should pay the forfeit of the offence
 to this pirithous for his friend agreed
 and on his promise was the prisoner freed

all nature seems at work . slugs leave their lair
 the bees are stirring — birds are on the wing
 and winter , slumbering in the open air
 wears on his smiling face a dream of spring
 and i the while , the sole unbusy thing
 nor honey make , nor pair , nor build , nor sing
 yet well i ken the banks where amaranths blow
 have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow
 bloom , o ye amaranths ! bloom for whom ye may
 for me ye bloom not ! glide , rich streams , away
 with lips unbrightened , wreathless brow , i stroll
 and would you learn the spells that drowse my soul
 work without hope draws nectar in a sieve
 and hope without an object cannot live

he said : then from the bank his javelin tore
 and left the breathless warrior in his gore
 the floating tides the bloody carcase lave
 and beat against it , wave succeeding wave
 till , roll ’ d between the banks , it lies the food
 of curling eels , and fishes of the flood
 all scatter ’ d round the stream ( their mightiest slain
 the amazed paeonians scour along the plain
 he vents his fury on the flying crew
 thrasius , astyplus , and mnesus slew
 mydon , thersilochus , with æ nius , fell
 and numbers more his lance had plunged to hell
 but from the bottom of his gulfs profound
 scamander spoke ; the shores return ’ d the sound

give period to my matter of complaining
 fair wonder of our time 's admiring eye
 and entertain no more thy long disdaining
 or give me leave at last that i may die
 for who can live , perpetually secluded
 from death to life , that loathes her discontent
 lest by some hope seducively deluded
 such thoughts aspire to fortunate event
 but i that now have drawn mal pleasant breath
 under the burden of thy cruel hate
 o , i must long and linger after death
 and yet i dare not give my life her date
 for if i die and thou repent t ’ have slain me
 ‘ twill grieve me more than if thou didst disdain me

this bronze doth keep the very form and mold
 of our great martyr 's face . yes , this is he
 that brow all wisdom , all benignity
 that human , humorous mouth ; those cheeks that hold
 like some harsh landscape all the summer 's gold
 that spirit fit for sorrow , as the sea
 for storms to beat on ; the lone agony
 those silent , patient lips too well foretold
 yes , this is he who ruled a world of men
 as might some prophet of the elder day
 brooding above the tempest and the fray
 with deep eyed thought and more than mortal ken
 a power was his beyond the touch of art
 or armed strength — his pure and mighty heart

in former days , just by cythera town
 a monastery was , of some renown
 with nuns the queens of beauty filled the place
 and gay gallants you easily might trace
 the courtier , citizen , and parson too
 the doctor and the bachelor you 'd view
 with eager steps :— all visits thither made
 and ‘ mong the latter , one ( a pleasing blade
 had free access : was thought a prudent friend
 who might to sisters many comforts lend
 was always closely shaved and nicely dressed
 and ev'ry thing he said was well expressed
 the breath of scandal , howsoever pat
 ne'er lighted on his neat cravat nor hat

the increasing moonlight drifts across my bed
 and on the churchyard by the road , i know
 it falls as white and noiselessly as snow
 ‘ twas such a night two weary summers fled
 the stars , as now , were waning overhead
 listen ! again the shrill lipped bugles blow
 where the swift currents of the river flow
 past fredericksburg : far off the heavens are red
 with sudden conflagration : on yon height
 linstock in hand , the gunners hold their breath
 a signal rocket pierces the dense night
 flings its spent stars upon the town beneath
 hark !— the artillery massing on the right
 hark !— the black squadrons wheeling down to death

“ o mother ida , harken ere i die
 still she spake on and still she spake of power
 ‘ which in all action is the end of all
 power fitted to the season ; wisdom bred
 and throned of wisdom — from all neighbour crowns
 alliance and allegiance , till thy hand
 fail from the sceptre staff . such boon from me
 from me , heaven 's queen , paris , to thee king born
 a shepherd all thy life but yet king born
 should come most welcome , seeing men , in power
 only , are likest gods , who have attain 'd
 rest in a happy place and quiet seats
 above the thunder , with undying bliss
 in knowledge of their own supremacy

lord , thou thyself art love and only thou
 yet i who am not love would fain love thee
 but thou alone being love canst furnish me
 with that same love my heart is craving now
 allow my plea ! for if thou disallow
 no second fountain can i find but thee
 no second hope or help is left to me
 no second anything , but only thou
 o love accept , according my request
 o love exhaust , fulfilling my desire
 uphold me with the strength that cannot tire
 nerve me to labor till thou bid me rest
 kindle my fire from thine unkindled fire
 and charm the willing heart from out my breast

“ to ride a stick , to build a paper house
 play odd and even , harness mouse and mouse
 if a grown man professed to find delight
 in things like these , you 'd call him mad outright
 “ well now , should reason force you to admit
 that love is just as childish , every whit
 to own that whimpering at your mistress ’ door
 is e'en as weak as building on the floor
 say , will you put conviction into act
 and , like young polemo , at once retract
 take off the signs and trappings of disease
 your leg bands , tippets , furs , and muffatees
 as he slipped off his chaplets , when the word
 of sober wisdom all his being stirred

can you , joconde , so truly cruel prove
 to quit my fervent love in courts to move
 the promises of kings are airy dreams
 and scarcely last beyond the day 's extremes
 by watchful , anxious care alone retain 'd
 and lost , through mere caprice , as soon as gain 'd
 if weary of my charms , alas ! you feel
 still think , my love , what joys these woods conceal
 here dwell around tranquillity and ease
 the streams ’ soft murmurs , and the balmy breeze
 invite to sleep ; these vales where breathe the doves
 all , all , my dear joconde , renew our loves
 you laugh !— ah ! cruel , go , expose thy charms
 grim death will quickly spare me these alarms

‘ twas silence all . at last aegyptius spoke
 aegyptius , by his age and sorrow broke
 a length of days his soul with prudence crown 'd
 a length of days had bent him to the ground
 his eldest hope in arms to ilion came
 by great ulysses taught the path to fame
 but ( hapless youth ) the hideous cyclops tore
 his quivering limbs , and quaff 'd his spouting gore
 three sons remain 'd ; to climb with haughty fires
 the royal bed , eurynomus aspires
 the rest with duteous love his griefs assuage
 and ease the sire of half the cares of age
 yet still his antiphus he loves , he mourns
 and , as he stood , he spoke and wept by turns

hear how my sighs are echoed of the wind
 see how my tears are pitied by the rain
 feel what a flame possess è d hath my mind
 taste but the grief which i possess in vain
 then if my sighs the blustering winds surpass
 and wat'ry tears the drops of rain exceed
 and if no flame like mine nor is nor was
 nor grief like that whereon my soul doth feed
 relent , fair licia , when my sighs do blow
 yield at my tears , that flintlike drops consume
 accept the flame that doth my incense show
 allow the grief that is my heart 's perfume
 thus sighs and tears , flame , grief shall plead for me
 so shall i pray , and you a goddess be

though of the jews she merit most esteem
 yet here the christian has the greater theme
 her martial song describes how sis'ra fell
 this sings our triumph over death and hell
 the rising light employ 'd the sacred breath
 of the blest virgin and elizabeth
 in songs of joy the angels sung his birth
 here how he treated was upon the earth
 trembling we read ! th'affliction and the scorn
 which for our guilt so patiently was borne
 conception , birth , and suff'ring , all belong
 ( though various parts ) to one celestial song
 and she , well using so divine an art
 has in this concert sung the tragic part

love was laid down , all weary fast asleep
 whereas my love his armor took away
 the boy awaked , and straight began to weep
 but stood amazed , and knew not what to say
 “ weep not , my boy , ” said venus to her son
 “ thy weapons none can wield , but thou alone
 licia the fair , this harm to thee hath done
 i saw her here , and presently was gone
 she will restore them , for she hath no need
 to take thy weapons where thy valour lies
 for men to wound the fates have her decreed
 with favour , hands , with beauty , and with eyes
 no , venus , no : she scorns them , credit me
 but robbed thy son that none might care for thee

the little man with the vague beard and guise
 pulled at the wicket . “ come inside ! ” he said
 “ i 'll show you all we 've got now — it was size
 you wanted ? — oh , dry colors ! well ” — he led
 to a dim alley lined with musty bins
 and pulled one fiercely . violent and bold
 a sudden tempest of mad , shrieking sins
 scarlet screamed out above the battered gold
 of tins and picture frames . i held my breath
 he tugged another hard — and sapphire skies
 spread in vast quietude , serene as death
 o'er waves like crackled turquoise — and my eyes
 burnt with the blinding brilliance of calm sea
 “ we 're selling that lot there out cheap ! ” said he

i traverse oft in thought the battle plain
 of my past life , ‘ mid many a shatter 'd dream
 of pleasure , and of hope , which youth in vain
 based on the shifting sands of time 's swift stream
 fond bulwarks ‘ gainst the strong assaults of pain
 and ‘ mid their ruins , like an exiled man
 gazing on scenes where he can dwell no more
 i stand and mourn their sweet enchantment o'er
 where both life 's pleasures and its cares began
 earth crumbles ‘ neath our feet as we walk on
 and leaves a gulf behind none can retrace
 its pleasures flash a moment and are gone
 but if we treasure in our soul love 's grace
 that will refresh and gladden all our race

so take these kindly , even though there be
 some notes that unto other lyres belong
 stray echoes from the elder sons of song
 and think how from its neighbouring native sea
 the pensive shell doth borrow melody
 i would not do the lordly masters wrong
 by filching fair words from the shining throng
 whose music haunts me as the wind a tree
 lo , when a stranger in soft syrian glooms
 shot through with sunset treads the cedar dells
 and hears the breezy ring of elfin bells
 far down by where the white haired cataract booms
 he , faint with sweetness caught from forest smells
 bears thence , unwitting , plunder of perfumes

beyond the low marsh meadows and the beach
 seen through the hoary trunks of windy pines
 the long blue level of the ocean shines
 the distant surf , with hoarse , complaining speech
 out from its sandy barrier seems to reach
 and while the sun behind the woods declines
 the moaning sea with sighing boughs combines
 and waves and pines make answer , each to each
 o melancholy soul , whom far and near
 in life , faith , hope , the same sad undertone
 pursues from thought to thought ! thou needs must hear
 an old refrain , too much , too long thine own
 ‘ tis thy mortality infects thine ear
 the mournful strain was in thyself alone

like this , is ours ; this night we ventur 'd out
 on juv'nile wing , appall 'd by many a doubt
 cheer 'd by your sanction , every peril o'er
 with joy we hail this welcome , friendly shore
 our little band , ambitious now to raise
 a pleasing off'ring for your wreath of praise
 on them bestow 'd , depute me here to tell
 the lively feelings that their bosoms swell
 for your indulgent and parental part
 they feel the triumph of a grateful heart
 that , each revolving year shall truly prove
 how much they honor , how sincere they love
 and for your fostering care will make return
 by filial duty , and desire to learn

well , this being so , and we who know it being
 so curious about those well locked houses
 the minds of those we know ,— to enter softly
 and steal from floor to floor up shadowy stairways
 from room to quiet room , from wall to wall
 breathing deliberately the very air
 pressing our hands and nerves against warm darkness
 to learn what ghosts are there
 suppose for once i set my doors wide open
 and bid you in . . . . suppose i try to tell you
 the secrets of this house , and how i live here
 suppose i tell you who i am , in fact
 deceiving you — as far as i may know it
 only so much as i deceive myself

if cross 'd with all mishaps be my poor life
 if one short day i never spent in mirth
 if my sp'rit with itself holds lasting strife
 if sorrow 's death is but new sorrow 's birth
 if this vain world be but a mournful stage
 where slave born man plays to the scoffing stars
 if youth be toss 'd with love , with weakness age
 if knowledge serves to hold our thoughts in wars
 if time can close the hundred mouths of fame
 and make what 's long since past , like that 's to be
 if virtue only be an idle name
 if being born i was but born to die
 why seek i to prolong these loathsome days
 the fairest rose in shortest time decays

when i was still a boy and mother 's pride
 a bigger boy spoke up to me so kind like
 ‘ if you do like , i 'll treat you with a ride
 in this wheel barrow . ’ so then i was blind like
 to what he had a working in his mind like
 and mounted for a passenger inside
 and coming to a puddle , pretty wide
 he tipp 'd me in a grinning back behind like
 so when a man may come to me so thick like
 and shake my hand where once he pass 'd me by
 and tell me he would do me this or that
 i can n't help thinking of the big boy 's trick like
 and then , for all i can but wag my hat
 and thank him , i do feel a little shy

while nature broods o'er the soft repose
 of the dewy mead , and the half shut rose
 does not that lovely hour give birth
 to thoughts more allied to heaven than earth
 when things that have been in perspective pass
 like the sun 's last rays over memory 's glass
 when life 's cares are forgot , when its joys are our own
 and the mild beams of faith round the future are thrown
 when all that awakened remorse or regret
 like a stormy morn , has in splendour set
 when the sorrows of time and the hopes of heaven
 blend in the soul like the hues of even
 and the spirit looks back on this troubled scene
 with a glance as bright as it ne'er had been

this congreve follows in his deathless line
 and the tenth hand is put to the design
 the happy boldness of his finish 'd toil
 claims more than shakespear 's wit , or johnson 's oil
 sing on , harmonious swan , in weeping strains
 and tell pastora 's death to mournful swains
 or with more pleasing charms , with softer airs
 sweeten our passions , and delude our cares
 or let thy satyr grin with half a smile
 and jeer in easy etherege 's style
 let manly wycherly chalk out the way
 and art direct , where nature goes astray
 ‘ tis not for thee to write of conqu'ring kings
 the noise of arms will break thy am'rous strings

is not thy mother 's rede at one with theirs
 who cry “ the work is done ” ? what though to thee
 thee only , should the utterance shape itself
 “ o to forget , and to begin again
 only of thee be heard as that keen cry
 rending its way from some distracted heart
 that yields it and so breaks ? yet list the cry
 begin for her again , and learn to sing
 but first , in all thy learning learn to be
 is life a field ? then plough it up — re sow
 with worthier seed — is life a ship ? o heed
 the southing of thy stars — is life a breath
 breathe deeper , draw life up from hour to hour
 aye , from the deepest deep in thy deep soul

and yet i fear lest men who read these lines
 should judge of them as if they wholly spake
 the love i bear thee and thy holy sake
 saying : “ he doth the high name wrong who twines
 earth 's highest aim with him , and thus combines
 jesus and art . ” but i my refuge make
 in what the word said : “ man his life shall take
 from every word : ” in art god first designs
 he spoke the word . and let me humbly speak
 my faith , that art is nothing to the act
 lowliest , that to the truth bears witness meek
 renownless , even unknown , but yet a fact
 the glory of thy childhood and thy youth
 was not that thou didst show , but didst the truth

in plays like these i would not deal alone
 in words and phrases trite and too well known
 nor , stooping from the tragic height , drop down
 to the low level of buffoon and clown
 as though pert davus , or the saucy jade
 who sacks the gold and jeers the gull she made
 were like silenus , who , though quaint and odd
 is yet the guide and tutor of a god
 a hackneyed subject i would take and treat
 so deftly , all should hope to do the feat
 then , having strained and struggled , should concede
 to do the feat were difficult indeed
 so much may order and arrangement do
 to make the cheap seem choice , the threadbare new

and now the youthful , gay , capricious spring
 piercing her showery clouds with crystal light
 and with their hues reflected streaking bright
 her radiant bow , bids all her warblers sing
 the lark , shrill caroling on soaring wing
 the lonely thrush , in brake , with blossoms white
 that tunes his pipe so loud ; while , from the sight
 coy bending their dropt heads , young cowslips fling
 rich perfume o'er the fields .— it is the prime
 of hours that beauty robes :— yet all they gild
 cheer , and delight in this their fragrant time
 for thy dear sake , to me less pleasure yield
 than , veil 'd in sleet , and rain , and hoary rime
 dim winter 's naked hedge and plashy field

“ perverse mankind ! whose wills , created free
 charge all their woes on absolute degree
 all to the dooming gods their guilt translate
 and follies are miscall 'd the crimes of fate
 when to his lust aegysthus gave the rein
 did fate , or we , the adulterous act constrain
 did fate , or we , when great atrides died
 urge the bold traitor to the regicide
 hermes i sent , while yet his soul remain 'd
 sincere from royal blood , and faith profaned
 to warn the wretch , that young orestes , grown
 to manly years , should re assert the throne
 yet , impotent of mind , and uncontroll 'd
 he plunged into the gulf which heaven foretold

whoever thinks a faultless piece to see
 thinks what ne'er was , nor is , nor e'er shall be
 in every work regard the writer 's end
 since none can compass more than they intend
 and if the means be just , the conduct true
 applause , in spite of trivial faults , is due
 as men of breeding , sometimes men of wit
 to avoid great errors , must the less commit
 neglect the rules each verbal critic lays
 for not to know some trifles is a praise
 most critics , fond of some subservient art
 still make the whole depend upon a part
 they talk of principles , but notions prize
 and all to one loved folly sacrifice

and atm â spoke , with love and wonder bold
 “ tread i the valley where the fadeless vine
 drops dew immortal and sweet spices grow
 from fragrant roots which in that blessed mould
 watered by tears of penitential woe
 drank deep of primal peace and balm divine
 when in the morn of time the tale was told
 of forfeit happiness and ruined shrine
 tell me , o beauteous spirit of the bower
 is it thy gentle task when others sleep
 to guard all that a fallen world may keep
 of pristine bliss and lost felicities
 the fragrant memory of a purer hour
 the healing aroma of paradise

now seraphs crown 'd with helmets i behold
 helmets of substance more refin 'd than gold
 the skies with an united lustre shine
 and face to face th ’ immortal armies joyn
 god 's plated son , majestically gay
 urges his chariot thro ’ the chrystal way
 breaks down their ranks , and thunders , as he flies
 arms in his hands , and terrour in his eyes
 o'er heav'ns wide arch the routed squadrons rore
 and transfix d angels groan upon the diamond floor
 then , wheeling from olympus snowy top
 thro ’ the scorch 'd air the giddy leaders drop
 down to th ’ abyss of their allotted hell
 and gaze on the lost skies from whence they fell

where are the others ? voices from the deep
 caverns of darkness answer me : “ they sleep
 i name no names ; instinctively i feel
 each at some well remembered grave will kneel
 and from the inscription wipe the weeds and moss
 for every heart best knoweth its own loss
 i see their scattered gravestones gleaming white
 through the pale dusk of the impending night
 o'er all alike the impartial sunset throws
 its golden lilies mingled with the rose
 we give to each a tender thought , and pass
 out of the graveyards with their tangled grass
 unto these scenes frequented by our feet
 when we were young , and life was fresh and sweet

d é jame , arnesto , d é jame que llore

i was no coward . country bred and born
 i had no feeling but the keenest scorn
 for those fine lady “ ah 's ” and “ oh 's ” of fear
 so much assumed ( when any man is near
 but god implanted in each human heart
 a natural horror , and a sickly dread
 of that accurs è d , slimy , creeping thing
 that squirms a limbless carcass o'er the ground
 and where that inborn loathing is not found
 you 'll find the serpent qualities instead
 who fears it not , himself is next of kin
 and in his bosom holds some treacherous art
 whereby to counteract its venomed sting
 and all are sired by satan — chief of sin

thus having said , the hero bound his brows
 with leafy branches , then perform 'd his vows
 adoring first the genius of the place
 then earth , the mother of the heav'nly race
 the nymphs , and native godheads yet unknown
 and night , and all the stars that gild her sable throne
 and ancient cybel , and idaean jove
 and last his sire below , and mother queen above
 then heav'n ' s high monarch thunder 'd thrice aloud
 and thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud
 soon thro ’ the joyful camp a rumor flew
 the time was come their city to renew
 then ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown 'd
 the feasts are doubled , and the bowls go round

oh , beauty , passing beauty ! sweetest sweet
 how canst thou let me waste my youth in sighs
 i only ask to sit beside thy feet
 thou knowest i dare not look into thine eyes
 might i but kiss thy hand ! i dare not fold
 my arms about thee — scarcely dare to speak
 and nothing seems to me so wild and bold
 as with one kiss to touch thy bless è d cheek
 methinks if i should kiss thee , no control
 within the thrilling brain could keep afloat
 the subtle spirit . even while i spoke
 the bare word kiss hath made my inner soul
 to tremble like a lutestring , ere the note
 hath melted in the silence that it broke

more yet and more , and yet we mark not all
 the warning fain to bid fair women heed
 its hard brief note of deadly doom and deed
 the verse that strewed too thick with flowers the hall
 whence nero watched his fiery festival
 that iron page wherein men 's eyes who read
 see , bruised and marred between two babes that bleed
 a mad red handed husband 's martyr fall
 the scene which crossed and streaked with mirth the strife
 of henry with his sons and witchlike wife
 and that sweet pageant of the kindly fiend
 who , seeing three friends in spirit and heart made one
 crowned with good hap the true love wiles he screened
 in the pleached lanes of pleasant edmonton

much have i travelled in the realms of gold
 and many goodly states and kingdoms seen
 round many western islands have i been
 which bards in fealty to apollo hold
 oft of one wide expanse had i been told
 that deep browed homer ruled as his demesne
 yet did i never breathe its pure serene
 till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold
 then felt i like some watcher of the skies
 when a new planet swims into his ken
 or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes
 he stared at the pacific — and all his men
 looked at each other with a wild surmise
 silent , upon a peak in darien

yes , thou shalt smile again !— time always heals
 in youth , the wounds of sorrow .— o ! survey
 yon now subsided deep , thro ’ night a prey
 to warring winds , and to their furious peals
 surging tumultuous !— yet , as in dismay
 the settling billows tremble .— morning steals
 grey on the rocks ;— and soon , to pour the day
 from the streak 'd east , the radiant orb unveils
 in all his pride of light .— thus shall the glow
 of beauty , health , and hope , by soft degrees
 spread o'er thy breast ; disperse these storms of woe
 wake , with sweet pleasure 's sense , the wish to please
 till from those eyes the wonted lustres flow
 bright as the sun on calm 'd and crystal seas

beneath the thorn was good sir ambrose found
 his guests an ample crescent form 'd around
 nature 's own carpet spread the space between
 where blithe domestics plied in gold and green
 the venerable chaplain waved his wand
 and silence follow 'd as he stretch 'd his hand
 and with a trembling voice , and heart sincere
 implored a blessing on th ’ abundant cheer
 down sat the mingling throng , and shared a feast
 with hearty welcomes given , by love increased
 a patriarch family , a close link 'd band
 true to their rural chieftain , heart and hand
 the deep carouse can never boast the bliss
 the animation of a scene like this

highmindedness , a jealousy for good
 a loving kindness for the great man 's fame
 dwells here and there with people of no name
 in noisome alley , and in pathless wood
 and where we think the truth least understood
 oft may be found a “ singleness of aim
 that ought to frighten into hooded shame
 a money mong'ring , pitiable brood
 how glorious this affection for the cause
 of stedfast genius , toiling gallantly
 what when a stout unbending champion awes
 envy , and malice to their native sty
 unnumber 'd souls breathe out a still applause
 proud to behold him in his country 's eye

i ask not for those thoughts , that sudden leap
 from being 's sea , like the isle seeming kraken
 with whose great rise the ocean all is shaken
 and a heart tremble quivers through the deep
 give me that growth which some perchance deem sleep
 wherewith the steadfast coral stems uprise
 which , by the toil of gathering energies
 their upward way into clear sunshine keep
 until , by heaven 's sweetest influences
 slowly and slowly spreads a speck of green
 into a pleasant island in the seas
 where , mid fall palms , the cane roofed home is seen
 and wearied men shall sit at sunset 's hour
 hearing the leaves and loving god 's dear power

“ this circuit , ” said my teacher , “ knots the scourge
 for envy , and the cords are therefore drawn
 by charity 's correcting hand . the curb
 is of a harsher sound , as thou shalt hear
 ( if i deem rightly ) , ere thou reach the pass
 where pardon sets them free . but fix thine eyes
 intently through the air , and thou shalt see
 a multitude before thee seated , each
 along the shelving grot . ” then more than erst
 i op 'd my eyes , before me view 'd , and saw
 shadows with garments dark as was the rock
 and when we pass 'd a little forth , i heard
 a crying , “ blessed mary ! pray for us
 michael and peter ! all ye saintly host

where coral reefs gnaw with white cruel teeth
 the yellow surf , and the torn billows seethe
 when shines the southern cross o ’ er placid isles
 the afric mother sits , and singing , smiles
 unheeding that a dead world ’ s hidden pain
 beats wildly rhythmic through her pure refrain
 and lingers softly still an echoed sigh
 low in earth ’ s cradle song — sweet lullaby
 a warning song of doom — a song of woe
 of terror wild , she sings , down bending low
 the while bright gleams the starry cross above
 yet tells to her no tale of tender love
 of him who lifteth after time a cross
 that healeth all the wide world ’ s sin and loss

when satisfied the smart gallant appeared
 and anxiously to putting off adhered
 pretending that the wind and tide would fail
 the galleys sometimes were unfit to sail
 repairs required ; then further heard the news
 that certain pirates had unpleasant views
 to fall upon the escort they 'd contrived
 at length , a pirate suddenly arrived
 surprized the party left upon the shore
 destroyed the whole ; then sought the house for more
 and scaled the walls while darkness spread around
 the pirate was grifonio 's second found
 who , in a trice , the noble mansion took
 and joy gave place to grief in ev'ry look

thus having said , the father of the fires
 to the black labours of his forge retires
 soon as he bade them blow , the bellows turn ’ d
 their iron mouths ; and where the furnace burn ’ d
 resounding breathed : at once the blast expires
 and twenty forges catch at once the fires
 just as the god directs , now loud , now low
 they raise a tempest , or they gently blow
 in hissing flames huge silver bars are roll ’ d
 and stubborn brass , and tin , and solid gold
 before , deep fix ’ d , the eternal anvils stand
 the ponderous hammer loads his better hand
 his left with tongs turns the vex ’ d metal round
 and thick , strong strokes , the doubling vaults rebound

a sudden horror all the assembly shook
 when slowly rising , halitherses spoke
 ( reverend and wise , whose comprehensive view
 at once the present and the future knew
 “ me too , ye fathers , hear ! from you proceed
 the ills ye mourn ; your own the guilty deed
 ye gave your sons , your lawless sons , the rein
 ( oft warn 'd by mentor and myself in vain
 an absent hero 's bed they sought to soil
 an absent hero 's wealth they made their spoil
 immoderate riot , and intemperate lust
 the offence was great , the punishment was just
 weigh then my counsels in an equal scale
 nor rush to ruin . justice will prevail

robert of sicily , brother of pope urbane
 and valmond , emperor of allemaine
 despoiled of his magnificent attire
 bare headed , breathless , and besprent with mire
 with sense of wrong and outrage desperate
 strode on and thundered at the palace gate
 rushed through the court yard , thrusting in his rage
 to right and left each seneschal and page
 and hurried up the broad and sounding stair
 his white face ghastly in the torches ’ glare
 from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed
 voices and cries he heard , but did not heed
 until at last he reached the banquet room
 blazing with light , and breathing with perfume

the simple service reached at last its close
 when the sick brother to some hearers goes
 to learn their welfare , and his own impart
 with strongest tokens of a friendly heart
 those persons were both english — man and wife
 who knew , for years , the toils of bush farm life
 to them was introduced the new made preacher
 just then mistaken for an older teacher
 due explanations made , they him invite
 to call and see them , and stay over night
 he , nothing loath , the invitation kind
 at once accepted , with delighted mind
 the two return , and with their brethren meet
 to join in worship — simple , pure and sweet

and then with her round , brown arms she pressed
 his phantom form to her throbbing breast
 and whispered the name , in her happy sleep
 of her h ó h è hunter so fair and far
 and then she saw in her dreams the deep
 where the spirit wailed , and a falling star
 then stealthily crouching under the trees
 by the light of the moon , the kan é ti dan
 the little , wizened , mysterious man
 with his long locks tossed by the moaning breeze
 then a flap of wings , like a thunder bird
 and a wailing spirit the sleeper heard
 and lo , through the mists of the moon , she saw
 the hateful visage of h â rpstin à.

happy in sleep , waking content to languish
 embracing clouds by night , in daytime mourn
 my joys but shadows , touch of truth my anguish
 griefs ever springing , comforts never born
 and still expecting when she will relent
 grown hoarse with crying , “ mercy , mercy give
 so many vows and prayers having spent
 that weary of my life i loathe to live
 and yet the hydra of my cares renews
 still new born sorrows of her fresh disdain
 and still my hope the summer winds pursues
 finding no end nor period of my pain
 this is my state , my griefs do touch so nearly
 and thus i live because i love her dearly

“ behold an action , gods ! that claims your care
 lo great æ neas rushing to the war
 against pelides he directs his course
 phoebus impels , and phoebus gives him force
 restrain his bold career ; at least , to attend
 our favour ’ d hero , let some power descend
 to guard his life , and add to his renown
 we , the great armament of heaven , came down
 hereafter let him fall , as fates design
 that spun so short his life ’ s illustrious line
 but lest some adverse god now cross his way
 give him to know what powers assist this day
 for how shall mortal stand the dire alarms
 when heaven ’ s refulgent host appear in arms

is it indeed so ? if i lay here dead
 wouldst thou miss any life in losing mine
 and would the sun for thee more coldly shine
 because of grave damps falling round my head
 i marvelled , my beloved , when i read
 thy thought so in the letter . i am thine
 but . . . so much to thee ? can i pour thy wine
 while my hands tremble ? then my soul , instead
 of dreams of death , resumes life 's lower range
 then , love me , love ! look on me — breathe on me
 as brighter ladies do not count it strange
 for love , to give up acres and degree
 i yield the grave for thy sake , and exchange
 my near sweet view of heaven , for earth with thee

why should i sing in verse ? why should i frame
 these sad neglected notes for her dear sake
 why should i offer up unto her name
 the sweetest sacrifice my youth can make
 why should i strive to make her live for ever
 that never deigns to give me joy to live
 why should m'afflicted muse so much endeavour
 such honour unto cruelty to give
 if her defects have purchased her this fame
 what should her virtues do , her smiles , her love
 if this her worst , how should her best inflame
 what passions would her milder favours move
 favours , i think , would sense quite overcome
 and that makes happy lovers ever dumb

now comes the bonny may , dancing and skipping
 across the stepping stones of meadow streams
 bearing no kin to april showers a weeping
 but constant sunshine as her servant seems
 her heart is up — her sweetness , all a maying
 streams in her face , like gems on beauty 's breast
 the swains are sighing all , and well a daying
 lovesick and gazing on their lovely guest
 the sunday paths , to pleasant places leading
 are graced by couples linking arm in arm
 sweet smiles enjoying or some book a reading
 where love and beauty are the constant charm
 for while the bonny may is dancing by
 beauty delights the ear , and beauty fills the eye

loud blew the north thro ’ april 's pallid days
 nor grass the field , nor leaves the grove obtains
 nor crystal sun beams , nor the gilded rains
 that bless the hours of promise , gently raise
 warmth in the blood , without that fiery blaze
 which makes it boil along the throbbing veins
 albion , displeas 'd , her own lov 'd spring surveys
 passing , with volant step , o'er russet plains
 sees her to summer 's fierce embraces speed
 pale , and unrobed .— faithless ! thou well may'st hide
 close in his sultry breast thy recreant head
 that did'st , neglecting thy distinguish 'd isle
 in winter 's icy arms so long abide
 while britain vainly languish 'd for thy smile

i hated thee , fallen tyrant ! i did groan
 to think that a most unambitious slave
 like thou , shouldst dance and revel on the grave
 of liberty . thou mightst have built thy throne
 where it had stood even now : thou didst prefer
 a frail and bloody pomp which time has swept
 in fragments towards oblivion . massacre
 for this i prayed , would on thy sleep have crept
 treason and slavery , rapine , fear , and lust
 and stifled thee , their minister . i know
 too late , since thou and france are in the dust
 that virtue owns a more eternal foe
 than force or fraud : old custom , legal crime
 and bloody faith the foulest birth of time

my tears are true . though others be divine
 and sing of wars and troy 's new rising frame
 meeting heroic feet in every line
 that tread high measures in the scene of fame
 and i , though disaccustoming my muse
 and sing but low songs in an humble vein
 may one day raise my style as others use
 and turn elizon to a higher strain
 when re intombing from oblivious ages
 in better stanzas her surviving wonder
 i may opposed against the monster rage
 that part desert and excellence asunder
 that she though coy may yet survive to see
 her beauty 's wonder lives again in me

at last arrived that most important day
 when they from all must tear themselves away
 and feel , what emigrants had felt before
 that parting scenes to tender hearts are sore
 their christian brethren did them all commend
 to their kind father , savior , guide and friend
 and gave to them , as pledge of their regard
 a bagster 's bible — god 's own precious word
 their kind , deep feelings , other friends displayed
 by various gifts , till parting time delayed
 and these love tokens sensibly affect
 the emigrants , as proof of their respect
 and often , when they view them even now
 a shade might seem to cross each thoughtful brow

i wrote my sighs , and sent them to my love
 i praised that fair that none enough could praise
 but plaints nor praises could fair licia move
 above my reach she did her virtues raise
 and thus replied : “ false scrawl , untrue thou art
 to feign those sighs that nowhere can be found
 for half those praises came not from his heart
 whose faith and love as yet was never found
 thy master 's life , false scrawl shall be thy doom
 because he burns , i judge thee to the flame
 both your attempts deserve no better room
 thus at her word we ashes both became
 believe me , fair , and let my paper live
 or be not fair , and so me freedom give

if faithful souls be alike glorified
 as angels , then my father 's soul doth see
 and adds this even to full felicity
 that valiantly i hell 's wide mouth o'erstride
 but if our minds to these souls be descried
 by circumstances and by signs that be
 apparent in us not immediately
 how shall my mind 's white truth by them be tried
 they see idolatrous lovers weep and mourn
 and style blasphemous conjurors to call
 on jesus ’ name , and pharisaical
 dissemblers feign devotion . then turn
 o pensive soul ! to god , for he knows best
 thy grief , for he put it into my breast

amazed at what the lordly devil said
 the clod could naught reply , so great his dread
 but at the gasconade perretta smiled
 who kept his house and weary hours beguiled
 a sprightly clever lass , with prying eye
 who , when a shepherdess , could more descry
 than sheep or lambs she watched upon the plain
 if other views or points she sought to gain
 said she , weep not , i 'll undertake at ease
 to gull this novice devil as i please
 he 's young and ignorant ; has nothing seen
 thee ; from his rage , i thoroughly will skreen
 my little finger , if i like can show
 more malice than his head and body know

some foreign writers , some our own despise
 the ancients only , or the moderns prize
 thus wit , like faith , by each man is apply 'd
 to one small sect , and all are damn 'd beside
 meanly they seek the blessing to confine
 and force that sun but on a part to shine
 which not alone the southern wit sublimes
 but ripens spirits in cold northern climes
 which from the first has shone on ages past
 enlights the present , and shall warm the last
 tho ’ each may feel increases and decays
 and see now clearer and now darker days
 regard not then if wit be old or new
 but blame the false , and value still the true

a ladder , which my ken pursued in vain
 so lofty was the summit ; down whose steps
 i saw the splendours in such multitude
 descending , ev'ry light in heav'n , methought
 was shed thence . as the rooks , at dawn of day
 bestirring them to dry their feathers chill
 some speed their way a field , and homeward some
 returning , cross their flight , while some abide
 and wheel around their airy lodge ; so seem 'd
 that glitterance , wafted on alternate wing
 as upon certain stair it met , and clash 'd
 its shining . and one ling'ring near us , wax 'd
 so bright , that in my thought : said : “ the love
 which this betokens me , admits no doubt

‘ oh , monstrous slander on the human race
 then read conviction in ortuno 's case
 by nature fashion 'd in her happiest mood
 with learning , fancy , keenest wit endued
 to what high purpose , what exalted end
 these lofty gifts did great ortuno bend
 with grateful triumph did ortuno raise
 the mighty trophies to their author 's praise
 with skill deducing from th ’ harmonious whole
 immortal proofs of one creative soul
 ah , no ! infatuate with the dazzling light
 in them he saw their own creative might
 nay , madly deem 'd , if such their wond'rous skill
 the phantom of a god ‘ twas theirs to will

the time has been when nature 's simple face
 perennial youth possessed and winning grace
 but who shall dare , in this refining age
 with nature 's praise to soil his snowy page
 what polish 'd lover , unappall 'd by sneers
 dare court a beldame of six thousand years
 when every clown with microscopick eyes
 the gaping furrows on her forehead spies
 ‘ good sir , your pardon : in her naked state
 her withered form we cannot chuse but hate
 but fashion 's art the waste of time repairs
 each wrinkle fills , and dies her silver hairs
 thus wrought anew , our gentle bosoms low
 we cannot chuse but love what 's comme il fauts

in silence and as though expectantly
 she crouches at his feet , while he caresses
 his light drawn fingers with the touch of tresses
 sleeked round her head , close banded lustrously
 save where at nape and temple the smooth brown
 sleaves out into a pale transparent mist
 of hair and tangled light . so to exist
 poised ‘ twixt the deep of thought where spirits drown
 life in a void impalpable nothingness
 and , on the other side , the pain and stress
 of clamorous action and the gnawing fire
 of will , focal upon a point of earth — even thus
 to sit , eternally without desire
 and yet self known , were happiness for us

man 's heart may change , but nature 's glory never
 though to the sullen gaze of grief the sight
 of sun illumined skies may seem less bright
 or gathering clouds less grand , yet she , as ever
 is lovely or majestic . though fate sever
 the long linked bands of love , and all delight
 be lost , as in a sudden starless night
 the radiance may return , if he , the giver
 of peace on earth , vouchsafe the storm to still
 this breast once shaken with the strife of care
 is touched with silent joy . the cot — the hill
 beyond the broad blue wave — and faces fair
 are pictured in my dreams , yet scenes that fill
 my waking eye can save me from despair

of all the kings that ever here did reign
 edward named fourth as first in praise i name
 not for his fair outside , nor well lined brain
 although less gifts imp feathers oft on fame
 nor that he could , young wise , wise valiant , frame
 his sire 's revenge , join 'd with a kingdom 's gain
 and , gain 'd by mars , could yet mad mars so tame
 that balance weigh 'd what sword did late obtain
 nor that he made the flower de luce so ‘ fraid
 though strongly hedged of bloody lion 's paws
 that witty lewis to him a tribute paid
 nor this , nor that , nor any such small cause
 but only for this worthy knight durst prove
 to lose his crown , rather than fail his love

fly low , dear love , thy sun dost thou not see
 take heed , do not so near his rays aspire
 lest , for thy pride , inflamed with wreakful ire
 it burn thy wings , as it hath burn è d me
 thou haply sayst thy wings immortal be
 and so cannot consum è d be with fire
 and one is hope , the other is desire
 and that the heavens bestowed them both on thee
 a muse 's words made thee with hope to fly
 an angel 's face desire hath begot
 thyself engendered by a goddess ’ eye
 yet for all this , immortal thou art not
 of heavenly eye though thou begotten art
 yet art thou born but of a mortal heart

prodigious this ! the frail one of our play
 from her own sex should mercy find to day
 you might have held the pretty head aside
 peep 'd in your fans , been serious thus , and cried
 ‘ the play may pass — but that strange creature , shore
 i can n't — indeed now — i so hate a whore
 just as a blockhead rubs his thoughtless skull
 and thanks his stars he was not born a fool
 so from a sister sinner you shall hear
 ‘ how strangely you expose yourself , my dear
 but let me die , all raillery apart
 our sex are still forgiving at their heart
 and , did not wicked custom so contrive
 we 'd be the best good natured things alive

birds of a feather will flock together
 the robin sings to his ruddy mate
 and the chattering jays , in the winter weather
 to prate and gossip will congregate
 and the cawing crows on the autumn heather
 like evil omens , will flock together
 in extra session , for high debate
 and the lass will slip from a doting mother
 to hang with her lad on the garden gate
 birds of a feather will flock together
 ‘ tis an adage old ,— it is nature 's law
 and sure as the pole will the needle draw
 the fierce red cloud with the flaunting feather
 will follow the finger of h â rpstin à.

if we should part upon that one embrace
 and set our courses ever , each from each
 with all our treasure but a fading face
 and little ghostly syllables of speech
 should beauty 's moment never be renewed
 and moons on moons look out for us in vain
 and each but whisper from a solitude
 to hear but echoes of a lonely pain
 still in a world that fortune cannot change
 should walk those two that once were you and i
 those two that once when moon and stars were strange
 poets above us in an april sky
 heard a voice falling on the midnight sea
 mute , and for ever , but for you and me

a handmaid to the genius of thy song
 is sweet , fair scholarship . ‘ tis she supplies
 the fiery spirit of the passioned eyes
 with subtle syllables , whose notes belong
 to some chief source of perfect melodies
 and glancing through a laurelled , lordly throng
 of shining singers , lo ! my vision flies
 to william shakespeare ! he it is whose strong
 full , flute like music haunts thy stately verse
 a worthy levite of his court thou art
 one sent among us to defeat the curse
 that binds us to the actual . yea , thy part
 oh , lute voiced lover ! is to lull the heart
 of love repelled , its darkness to disperse

“ new light ! ” men cried , and murmured that it came
 from an unsanctioned source with lawless flame
 it shone too free , for still the church and school
 must only shine according to their rule
 but princeton answered , in her nobler mood
 “ god made the light , and all the light is good
 there is no war between the old and new
 the conflict lies between the false and true
 the stars , that high in heaven their courses run
 in glory differ , but their light is one
 the beacons , gleaming o'er the sea of life
 are rivals but in radiance , not in strife
 shine on , ye sister towers , across the night
 i too will build a lasting house of light

new england ! proudly may thy children claim
 their honored birthright by its humblest name
 cold are thy skies , but , ever fresh and clear
 no rank malaria stains thine atmosphere
 no fungous weeds invade thy scanty soil
 scarred by the ploughshares of unslumbering toil
 long may the doctrines by thy sages taught
 raised from the quarries where their sires have wrought
 be like the granite of thy rock ribbed land
 as slow to rear , as obdurate to stand
 and as the ice that leaves thy crystal mine
 chills the fierce alcohol in the creole 's wine
 so may the doctrines of thy sober school
 keep the hot theories of thy neighbors cool

at the round earth 's imagined corners blow
 your trumpets , angels ! and arise , arise
 from death , you numberless infinities
 of souls , and to your scattered bodies go
 all whom the flood did , and fire shall , overthrow
 all whom war , death , age , ague 's tyrannies
 despair , law , chance , hath slain ; and you whose eyes
 shall behold god , and never taste death 's woe
 but let them sleep , lord ! and me mourn a space
 for if above all these my sins abound
 ‘ tis late to ask abundance of thy grace
 when we are there . here on this holy ground
 teach me how to repent , for that 's as good
 as if thou hadst sealed my pardon with thy blood

less bronze , more silver , mingles in the mould
 of him whom next my roving eyes behold
 his , more the scholar 's than the statesman 's face
 proclaims him born of academic race
 weary his look , as if an aching brain
 left on his brow the frozen prints of pain
 his voice far reaching , grave , sonorous , owns
 a shade of sadness in its plaintive tones
 yet when its breath some loftier thought inspires
 glows with a heat that every bosom fires
 such everett seems ; no chance sown wild flower knows
 the full blown charms of culture 's double rose
 alas , how soon , by death 's unsparing frost
 its bloom is faded and its fragrance lost

thus , anxious , he explored the crowded field
 nor once the secret of his birth revealed
 heaven will 'd it so . pressed down by silent grief
 surrounding objects promised no relief
 this world to mortals still denies repose
 and life is still the scene of many woes
 again his eye , instinctive turned , descried
 the green pavilion , and the warrior 's pride
 again he cries : “ o tell his glorious name
 yon gallant horse declares the hero 's fame
 but false huj í r the aspiring hope repelled
 crushed the fond wish , the soothing balm withheld
 “ and why should i conceal his name from thee
 his name and title are unknown to me

that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
 for slander 's mark was ever yet the fair
 the ornament of beauty is suspect
 a crow that flies in heaven 's sweetest air
 so thou be good , slander doth but approve
 thy worth the greater being wooed of time
 for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
 and thou present'st a pure unstained prime
 thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
 either not assailed , or victor being charged
 yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
 to tie up envy , evermore enlarged
 if some suspect of ill masked not thy show
 then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe

o that you were your self , but love you are
 no longer yours , than you your self here live
 against this coming end you should prepare
 and your sweet semblance to some other give
 so should that beauty which you hold in lease
 find no determination , then you were
 your self again after your self 's decease
 when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
 who lets so fair a house fall to decay
 which husbandry in honour might uphold
 against the stormy gusts of winter 's day
 and barren rage of death 's eternal cold
 o none but unthrifts , dear my love you know
 you had a father , let your son say so

dear chorister , who from those shadows sends
 ere that the blushing morn dare show her light
 such sad , lamenting strains , that night attends
 become all ear ; stars stay to hear thy plight
 if one whose grief even reach of thought transcends
 who ne'er , not in a dream , did taste delight
 may thee importune who like case pretends
 and seems to joy in woe , in woe 's despite
 tell me ( so may thou fortune milder try
 and long , long sing ) for what thou thus complains
 since winter 's gone , and sun in dappled sky
 enamour 'd , smiles on woods and flowery plains
 the bird , as if my questions did her move
 with trembling wings sigh 'd forth , ‘ i love , i love

there were not many at that lonely place
 where two scourged hills met in a little plain
 the wind cried loud in gusts , then low again
 three pines strained darkly , runners in a race
 unseen by any . toward the further woods
 a dim harsh noise of voices rose and ceased
 — we were most silent in those solitudes
 then , sudden as a flame , the black robed priest
 the clotted earth piled roughly up about
 the hacked red oblong of the new made thing
 short words in swordlike latin — and a rout
 of dreams most impotent , unwearying
 then , like a blind door shut on a carouse
 the terrible bareness of the soul 's last house

as some lone miser , visiting his store
 bends at his treasure , counts , recounts it o'er
 hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill
 yet still he sighs , for hoards are wanting still
 thus to my breast alternate passions rise
 pleased with each good that heaven to man supplies
 yet oft a sigh prevails , and sorrows fall
 to see the hoard of human bliss so small
 and oft i wish amidst the scene to find
 some spot to real happiness consigned
 where my worn soul , each wandering hope at rest
 may gather bliss to see my fellows blest
 but where to find that happiest spot below
 who can direct , when all pretend to know

the silence of the storm weighs heavily
 on their strained spirits : sometimes one will say
 some trivial thing as though to ward away
 mysterious powers , that imminently lie
 in wait , with the strong exorcising grace
 of everyday 's futility . desire
 becomes upon a sudden a crystal fire
 defined and hard :— if he could kiss her face
 could kiss her hair ! as if by chance , her hand
 brushes on his ... ah , can she understand
 or is she pedestalled above the touch
 of his desire ? he wonders : dare he seek
 from her that little , that infinitely much
 and suddenly she kissed him on the cheek

to which the wife — “ dear husband , sad it is
 to me to think that thou shouldst part from me
 but sadder still the thought that thou shouldst go
 on seas to roam in lands unknown and strange
 and canst not tell when to this spot return
 there is our lordly mansion here ; there is
 our wealth , and here i am thy youthful wife
 why go away and risk thy precious life
 while we enjoy our days like king and queen
 why leave me here to pine away in grief
 and loneliness ? without my lord it is
 half death to me , and i would rather die
 than see him part ; hence banish from thy mind
 all thoughts of going and stay here with me

a hundred thousand birds salute the day
 one solitary bird salutes the night
 its mellow grieving wiles our grief away
 and tunes our weary watches to delight
 it seems to sing the thoughts we cannot say
 to know and sing them , and to set them right
 until we feel once more that may is may
 and hope some buds may bloom without a blight
 this solitary bird outweighs , outvies
 the hundred thousand merry making birds
 whose innocent warblings yet might make us wise
 would we but follow when they bid us rise
 would we but set their notes of praise to words
 and launch our hearts up with them to the skies

darkness like midnight from the sobbing woods
 clamours with dismal tidings of the rain
 roaring as rivers breaking loose in floods
 to spread and foam and deluge all the plain
 the cotter listens at his door again
 half doubting whether it be floods or wind
 and through the thickening darkness looks afraid
 thinking of roads that travel has to find
 through night 's black depths in danger 's garb arrayed
 and the loud glabber round the flaze soon stops
 when hushed to silence by the lifted hand
 of fearing dame who hears the noise in dread
 and thinks a deluge comes to drown the land
 nor dares she go to bed until the tempest drops

some glory in their birth , some in their skill
 some in their wealth , some in their body 's force
 some in their garments though new fangled ill
 some in their hawks and hounds , some in their horse
 and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
 wherein it finds a joy above the rest
 but these particulars are not my measure
 all these i better in one general best
 thy love is better than high birth to me
 richer than wealth , prouder than garments ’ costs
 of more delight than hawks and horses be
 and having thee , of all men 's pride i boast
 wretched in this alone , that thou mayst take
 all this away , and me most wretchcd make

when i behold that beauties wonderment
 and rare perfection of each goodly part
 of natures skill the onely complement
 i honor and admire the makers art
 but when i feele the bitter balefull smart
 which her fayre eyes unwares doe worke in mee
 that death out of theyr shiny beames doe dart
 i thinke that i a new pandora see
 whom all the gods in councell did agree
 into this sinfull world from heaven to send
 that she to wicked men a scourge should bee
 for all their faults with which they did offend
 but since ye are my scourge , i will intreat
 that for my faults ye will me gently beat

not distant far , a length of colonnade
 invites us ; monument of ancient taste
 now scorned , but worthy of a better fate
 our fathers knew the value of a screen
 from sultry suns , and , in their shaded walks
 and long protracted bowers , enjoyed at noon
 the gloom and coolness of declining day
 we bear our shades about us ; self deprived
 of other screen , the thin umbrella spread
 and range an indian waste without a tree
 thanks to benevolus — he spares me yet
 these chestnuts ranged in corresponding lines
 and , though himself so polished , still reprieves
 the obsolete prolixity of shade

high on a hill a goodly cedar grewe
 of wondrous length and straight proportion
 that farre abroad her daintie odours threwe
 mongst all the daughters of proud libanon
 her match in beautie was not anie one
 shortly within her inmost pith there bred
 a litle wicked worme , perceiv 'd of none
 that on her sap and vitall moysture fed
 thenceforth her garland so much honoured
 began to die , o great ruth * for the same
 and her faire lockes fell from her loftie head
 that shortly balde and bared she became
 i , which this sight beheld , was much dismayed
 to see so goodly thing so soone decayed

thus then he disappeared , was rarified
 for ‘ tis improper speech to say he died
 he was exhaled ; his great creator drew
 his spirit , as the sun the morning dew
 ‘ tis sin produces death ; and he had none
 but the taint adam left on every son
 he added not , he was so pure , so good
 ‘ twas but the original forfeit of his blood
 and that so little , that the river ran
 more clear than the corrupted fount began
 nothing remain 'd of the first muddy clay
 the length of course had wash 'd it in the way
 so deep , and yet so clear , we might behold
 the gravel bottom , and that bottom gold

black grows the southern sky , betokening rain
 and humming hive bees homeward hurry bye
 they feel the change ; so let us shun the grain
 and take the broad road while our feet are dry
 ay , there some dropples moistened on my face
 and pattered on my hat — tis coming nigh
 let 's look about , and find a sheltering place
 the little things around , like you and i
 are hurrying through the grass to shun the shower
 here stoops an ash tree — hark ! the wind gets high
 but never mind ; this ivy , for an hour
 rain as it may , will keep us dryly here
 that little wren knows well his sheltering bower
 nor leaves his dry house though we come so near

when i had chosen on the river 's edge
 such station , that the distance of the stream
 alone did separate me ; there i stay 'd
 my steps for clearer prospect , and beheld
 the flames go onward , leaving , as they went
 the air behind them painted as with trail
 of liveliest pencils ! so distinct were mark 'd
 all those sev'n listed colours , whence the sun
 maketh his bow , and cynthia her zone
 these streaming gonfalons did flow beyond
 my vision ; and ten paces , as i guess
 parted the outermost . beneath a sky
 so beautiful , came foul and twenty elders
 by two and two , with flower de luces crown 'd

thou blind fool love , what dost thou to mine eyes
 that they behold and see not what they see
 they know what beauty is , see where it lies
 yet what the best is , take the worst to be
 if eyes corrupt by over partial looks
 be anchored in the bay where all men ride
 why of eyes ’ falsehood hast thou forged hooks
 whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
 why should my heart think that a several plot
 which my heart knows the wide world 's common place
 or mine eyes seeing this , say this is not
 to put fair truth upon so foul a face
 in things right true my heart and eyes have erred
 and to this false plague are they now transferred

oh , for the time gone by , when thought of christ
 made his yoke easy and his burden light
 when my heart stirred within me at the sight
 of altar spread for awful eucharist
 when all my hopes his promises sufficed
 when my soul watched for him by day , by night
 when my lamp lightened and my robe was white
 and all seemed loss , except the pearl unpriced
 yet , since he calls me still with tender call
 since he remembers whom i half forgot
 i even will run my race and bear my lot
 for faith the walls of jericho cast down
 and hope to whoso runs holds forth a crown
 and love is christ , and christ is all in all

the ticking — ticking — ticking of the clock
 that vexed me so last night —! “ for though time keeps
 such drowsy watch , ” i moaned , “ he never sleeps
 but only nods above the world to mock
 its restless occupant , then rudely rock
 it as the cradle of a babe that weeps
 i seemed to see the seconds piled in heaps
 like sand about me ; and at every shock
 o ’ the bell , the piled sands were swirled away
 as by a desert storm that swept the earth
 stark as a granary floor , whereon the gray
 and mist bedrizzled moon amidst the dearth
 came crawling , like a sickly child , to lay
 its pale face next mine own and weep for day

i am a little world , made cunningly
 of elements and an angelic sprite
 but black sin hath betrayed to endless night
 my world 's both parts , and oh ! both parts must die
 you , which beyond that heaven , which was most high
 have found new spheres , and of new land can write
 pour new seas in mine eyes , that so i might
 drown my world with my weeping earnestly
 or wash it , if it must be drowned no more
 but oh ! it must be burnt ; alas ! the fire
 of lust and envy burnt it heretofore
 and made it fouler ; let their flames retire
 and burn me , o lord ! with a fiery zeal
 of thee and thy house , which doth in eating heal

wings have we , and as far as we can go
 we may find pleasure : wilderness and wood
 blank ocean and mere sky , support that mood
 which with the lofty sanctifies the low
 dreams , books , are each a world ; and books , we know
 are a substantial world , both pure and good
 round these , with tendrils strong as flesh and blood
 our pastime and our happiness will grow
 there do i find a never failing store
 of personal themes , and such as i love best
 matter wherein right voluble i am
 two will i mention , dearer than the rest
 the gentle lady , married to the moor
 and heavenly una with her milk white lamb

whilst echo cries , “ what shall become of me
 and desolate , my desolations pity
 thou in thy beauty 's carack sitt'st to see
 my tragic downfall , and my funeral ditty
 no timbrel , but my heart thou play'st upon
 whose strings are stretched unto the highest key
 the diapason , love ; love is the unison
 in love my life and labours waste away
 only regardless to the world thou leav'st me
 whilst slain hopes , turning from the feast of sorrow
 unto despair , their king , which ne'er deceives me
 captives my heart , whose black night hates the morrow
 and he in truth of my distressed cry
 plants me a weeping star within mine eye

somewhere i read , in an old book whose name
 is gone from me , i read that when the days
 of a man are counted , and his business done
 there comes up the shore at evening , with the tide
 to the place where he sits , a boat
 and in the boat , from the place where he sits , he sees
 dim in the dusk , dim and yet so familiar
 the faces of his friends long dead ; and knows
 they come for him , brought in upon the tide
 to take him where men go at set of day
 then rising , with his hands in theirs , he goes
 between them his last steps , that are the first
 of the new life — and with the ebb they pass
 their shaken sail grown small upon the moon

the richest relic rome did ever view
 was ’ c æ sar 's tomb ; on which , with cunning hand
 jove 's triple honours , the three fair graces , stand
 telling his virtues in their virtues true
 this rome admired ; but dearest dear , in you
 dwelleth the wonder of the happiest land
 and all the world to neptune 's furthest strand
 for what rome shaped hath living life in you
 thy naked beauty , bounteously displayed
 enricheth monarchies of hearts with love
 thine eyes to hear complaints are open laid
 thine eyes ’ kind looks requite all pains i prove
 that of my death i dare not thee accuse
 but pride in me that baser chance refuse

as kings who see their little life day pass
 take off the heavy ermine and the crown
 so had the trees that autumn time laid down
 their golden garments on the faded grass
 when i , who watched the seasons in the glass
 of mine own thoughts , saw all the autumn 's brown
 leap into life and don a sunny gown
 of leafage such as happy april has
 great spring came singing upward from the south
 for in my heart , far carried on the wind
 your words like winged seeds took root and grew
 and all the world caught music from your mouth
 i saw the light as one who had been blind
 and knew my sun and song and spring were you

thrice happy he , who by some shady grove
 far from the clamorous world , doth live his own
 though solitary , who is not alone
 but doth converse with that eternal love
 o how more sweet is birds ’ harmonious moan
 or the soft sobbings of the widowed dove
 than those smooth whisperings near a prince 's throne
 which good make doubtful , do the evil approve
 or how more sweet is zephyr 's wholesome breath
 and sighs perfumed which do the flowers unfold
 than that applause vain honor doth bequeath
 how sweet are streams to poison drunk in gold
 the world is full of horrors , falsehoods , slights
 woods ’ silent shades have only true delights

an hideous dragon , dreadfull to behold
 whose backe was arm 'd against the dint of speare
 with shields of brasse that shone like burnisht golde
 and forkhed sting that death in it did beare
 strove with a spider , his unequall peare
 and bad defiance to his enemie
 the subtill vermin , creeping closely * neare
 did in his drinke shed poyson privilie
 which , through his entrailes spredding diversly
 made him to swell , that nigh his bowells brust
 and him enforst to yeeld the victorie
 that did so much in his owne greatnesse trust
 o , how great vainnesse is it then to scorne
 the weake , that hath the strong so oft forlorne

the god obeys , and to his feet applies
 those golden wings that cut the yielding skies
 his ample hat his beamy locks o'erspread
 and veil 'd the starry glories of his head
 he seized the wand that causes sleep to fly
 or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye
 that drives the dead to dark tartarean coasts
 or back to life compels the wandering ghosts
 thus through the parting clouds the son of may
 wings on the whistling winds his rapid way
 now smoothly steers through air his equal flight
 now springs aloft , and towers th ’ ethereal height
 then wheeling down the steep of heaven he flies
 and draws a radiant circle o'er the skies

dear craoibhin aoibhin , look into our case
 when we are high and airy hundreds say
 that if we hold that flight they 'll leave the place
 while those same hundreds mock another day
 because we have made our art of common things
 so bitterly , you 'd dream they longed to look
 all their lives through into some drift of wings
 you 've dandled them and fed them from the book
 and know them to the bone ; impart to us
 we 'll keep the secret — a new trick to please
 is there a bridle for this proteus
 that turns and changes like his draughty seas
 or is there none , most popular of men
 but when they mock us that we mock again

they flout me as half english — a disgrace
 for which scarce all your virtues can atone
 mother , in whom i find no flaw but one
 that you are saxon !— but this fault of race
 fell not on me nor yet , i fear , your grace
 of english speech , else had more smoothly run
 these echoes of welsh lyrics , and your son
 need not have flinched before the critic 's face
 such as they are , from your far yorkshire home
 perchance they may in fancy bid you come
 pondering past memories , to my native land
 once more to see fair mawddach from the bridge
 to mark how cader rises , ridge on ridge
 or , where llanaber guards our dead , to stand

the city slept beneath the moonbeam 's glance
 her white walls gleaming through the vines of france
 and all was hushed , save where the footsteps fell
 on some high tower , of midnight sentinel
 but one still watched ; no self encircled woes
 chased from his lids the angel of repose
 he watched , he wept , for thoughts of bitter years
 bowed his dark lashes , wet with burning tears
 his country 's sufferings and her children 's shame
 streamed o'er his memory like a forest 's flame
 each treasured insult , each remembered wrong
 rolled through his heart and kindled into song
 his taper faded ; and the morning gales
 swept through the world the war song of marseilles

within this wood , out of a rocke did rise
 a spring of water , mildly rumbling downe
 whereto approched not in anie wise
 the homely shepheard , nor the ruder clowne
 but manie muses , and the nymphes withall
 that sweetly in accord did tune their voyce
 to the soft sounding of the waters fall
 that my glad hart thereat did much reioyce
 but , while herein i tooke my chiefe delight
 i saw , alas ! the gaping earth devoure
 the spring , the place , and all cleane out of sight
 which yet aggreeves my hart even to this houre
 and wounds my soule with rufull memorie
 to see such pleasures gon so suddenly

among the wondrous ways of men and time
 he went as one that ever found and sought
 and bore in hand the lamplike spirit of thought
 to illume with instance of its fire sublime
 the dusk of many a cloudlike age and clime
 no spirit in shape of light and darkness wrought
 no faith , no fear , no dream , no rapture , nought
 that blooms in wisdom , nought that burns in crime
 no virtue girt and armed and helmed with light
 no love more lovely than the snows are white
 no serpent sleeping in some dead soul 's tomb
 no song bird singing from some live soul 's height
 but he might hear , interpret , or illume
 with sense invasive as the dawn of doom

something this foggy day , a something which
 is neither of this fog nor of to day
 has set me dreaming of the winds that play
 past certain cliffs , along one certain beach
 and turn the topmost edge of waves to spray
 ah pleasant pebbly strand so far away
 so out of reach while quite within my reach
 as out of reach as india or cathay
 i am sick of where i am and where i am not
 i am sick of foresight and of memory
 i am sick of all i have and all i see
 i am sick of self , and there is nothing new
 oh weary impatient patience of my lot
 thus with myself : how fares it , friends , with you

stretched on a sunny bank he lay at rest
 ferns at his elbow , lilies round his knees
 with sweet flesh patterned where the cool turf pressed
 flowerlike crept o'er with emerald aphides
 single he couched there , to his circling flocks
 piping at times some happy shepherd 's tune
 nude , with the warm wind in his golden locks
 and arched with the blue asian afternoon
 past him , gorse purpled , to the distant coast
 rolled the clear foothills . there his white walled town
 there , a blue band , the placid euxine lay
 beyond , on fields of azure light embossed
 he watched from noon till dewy eve came down
 the summer clouds pile up and fade away

when the first larvae on the elm are seen
 the crawling wretches , like its leaves , are green
 ere chill october shakes the latest down
 they , like the foliage , change their tint to brown
 on the blue flower a bluer flower you spy
 you stretch to pluck it — ‘ tis a butterfly
 the flattened tree toads so resemble bark
 they 're hard to find as ethiops in the dark
 the woodcock , stiffening to fictitious mud
 cheats the young sportsman thirsting for his blood
 so by long living on a single lie
 nay , on one truth , will creatures get its dye
 red , yellow , green , they take their subject 's hue
 except when squabbling turns them black and blue

the sands of westmoreland , the creeks and bays
 of cumbria 's rocky limits , they can tell
 how , when the sea threw off his evening shade
 and to the shepherd 's hut on distant hills
 sent welcome notice of the rising moon
 how i have stood , to fancies such as these
 a stranger , linking with the spectacle
 no conscious memory of a kindred sight
 and bringing with me no peculiar sense
 of quietness or peace ; yet have i stood
 even while mine eye hath moved o'er many a league
 of shining water , gathering as it seemed
 through every hair breadth in that field of light
 new pleasure like a bee among the flowers

scorn only , scorn begot of bitter proof
 by keen experience of a trustless heart
 bears burning in her new born hand the dart
 wherewith love dies heart stricken , and the roof
 falls of his palace , and the storied woof
 long woven of many a year with life 's whole art
 is rent like any rotten weed apart
 and hardly with reluctant eyes aloof
 cold memory guards one relic scarce exempt
 yet from the fierce corrosion of contempt
 and hardly saved by pity . woe are we
 that once we loved , and love not ; but we know
 the ghost of love , surviving yet in show
 where scorn has passed , is vain as grief must be

no sooner on my vision streaming , smote
 the heav'nly influence , which years past , and e'en
 in childhood , thrill 'd me , than towards virgil i
 turn 'd me to leftward , panting , like a babe
 that flees for refuge to his mother 's breast
 if aught have terrified or work 'd him woe
 and would have cried : “ there is no dram of blood
 that doth not quiver in me . the old flame
 throws out clear tokens of reviving fire
 but virgil had bereav 'd us of himself
 virgil , my best lov 'd father ; virgil , he
 to whom i gave me up for safety : nor
 all , our prime mother lost , avail 'd to save
 my undew 'd cheeks from blur of soiling tears

thou pain , the only guest of loathed constraint
 the child of curse , man 's weakness foster child
 brother to woe , and father of complaint
 thou pain , thou hated pain , from heaven exiled
 how hold'st thou her whose eyes constraint doth fear
 whom cursed do bless ; whose weakness virtues arm
 who others ’ woes and plaints can chastely bear
 in whose sweet heaven angels of high thoughts swarm
 what courage strange hath caught thy caitiff heart
 fear'st not a face that oft whole hearts devours
 or art thou from above bid play this part
 and so no help ‘ gainst envy of those powers
 if thus , alas , yet while those parts have woe
 so stay her tongue , that she no more say , “ o

why are we by all creatures waited on
 why do the prodigal elements supply
 life and food to me , being more pure than i
 simpler , and further from corruption
 why brook'st thou , ignorant horse , subjection
 why do you , bull and boar , so sillily
 dissemble weakness , and by one man 's stroke die
 whose whole kind you might swallow and feed upon
 weaker i am , woe 's me ! and worse than you
 you have not sinned , nor need be timorous
 but wonder at a greater , for to us
 created nature doth these things subdue
 but their creator , whom sin nor nature tied
 for us , his creatures and his foes , hath died

falls from her heaven the moon , and stars sink burning
 into the sea where blackness rims the sea
 silently quenched . faint light that the waves hold
 is only light remaining ; yet still gleam
 the sands where those now sleeping young moon bathers
 came dripping out of the sea and from their arms
 shook flakes of light , dancing on the foamy edge
 of quiet waves . they were all things of light
 tossed from the sea to dance under the moon
 her nuns , dancing within her dying round
 clear limbs and breasts silvered with moon and waves
 and quick with windlike mood and body 's joy
 withdrawn from alien vows , by wave and wind
 lightly absolved and lightly all forgetting

behold what hap pygmalion had to frame
 and carve his proper grief upon a stone
 my heavy fortune is much like the same
 i work on flint and that 's the cause i moan
 for hapless lo , even with mine own desires
 i figured on the table of my heart
 the fairest form that the world 's eye admires
 and so did perish by my proper art
 and still i toil to change the marble breast
 of her whose sweetest grace i do adore
 yet cannot find her breathe unto my rest
 hard is her heart , and woe is me therefore
 o happy he that joyed his stone and art
 unhappy i , to love a stony heart

huge elm , with rifted trunk all notched and scarred
 like to a warrior 's destiny ! i love
 to stretch me often on thy shadowed sward
 and hear the laugh of summer leaves above
 or on thy buttressed roots to sit , and lean
 in careless attitude , and there reflect
 on times , and deeds , and darings that have been
 old castaways , now swallowed in neglect
 while thou art towering in thy strength of heart
 stirring the soul to vain imaginings
 in which life 's sordid being hath no part
 the wind of that eternal ditty sings
 humming of future things , that burn the mind
 to leave some fragment of itself behind

then woe is me ! ah ! how was i befooled
 i thought that gold ( which answereth all things ) could
 have stood my friend at any time to bail me
 but grief grows great , and now my trust doth fail me
 oh ! that my conscience were but clear within
 which now is racked with my former sin
 with horror i behold my secret stealing
 my bribes , oppression , and my graceless dealing
 my office sins , which i had clean forgotten
 will gnaw my soul when all my bones are rotten
 i must confess it , very grief doth force me
 dead or alive , both god and man doth curse me
 let all excisemen hereby warning take
 to shun their practice for their conscience sake

brave ships are these that bear thee home again
 from under far off skies — brave flags that fly
 above the deck whereon thine ashes lie
 waiting their urn beyond the alien main
 the nations pause to view thy funeral train
 as slowly moving up ‘ twixt sea and sky
 it comes with stately pomp , and liberty
 holds out her hands and calls thy name in vain
 and yet , mayhap , in vision vague and sweet
 another sight thou seest beyond the boast
 of patriot pride — beside the new born fleet
 spectral and strange , no guest for such a host
 yet making thy home coming all complete
 the old “ bon homme richard 's ” unlaid ghost

on village green , whose smooth and well worn sod
 cross path 'd with every gossip 's foot is trod
 by cottage door where playful children run
 and cats and curs sit basking in the sun
 where o'er the earthen seat the thorn is bent
 cross arm 'd , and back to wall , poor william leant
 his bonnet broad drawn o'er his gather 'd brow
 his hanging lip and lengthen 'd visage shew
 a mind but ill at ease . with motions strange
 his listless limbs their wayward postures change
 whilst many a crooked line and curious maze
 with clouted shoon , he on the sand pourtrays
 the half chew 'd straw fell slowly from his mouth
 and to himself low mutt'ring spoke the youth

white envoy : [ stepping forward
 greeting from shalmaneser , asshur 's son
 who rules the world from nineveh

 the south has fallen before him , and the west
 his feet have trodden ; hamath is laid waste
 he pauses at your gate , invincible

‘ has truth no charms ? ’ when first beheld , i grant
 but , wanting novelty , has every want
 for pleasure 's thrill the sickly palate flies
 save haply pungent with a rare surprise
 the humble toad that leaps her nightly round
 the harmless tenant of the garden ground
 is loath 'd , abhor 'd , nay , all the reptile race
 together join 'd were never half so base
 yet snugly find her in some quarry pent
 through ages doom 'd to one tremendous lent
 surviving still , as if “ in nature 's spite
 without or nourishment , or air , or light
 what raptures then th ’ astonish 'd gazer seize
 what lovely creature like a toad can please

if i must die , o let me chuse my death
 suck out my soul with kisses , cruel maid
 in thy breasts crystal balls embalm my breath
 dole it all out in sighs when i am laid
 thy lips on mine like cupping glasses clasp
 let our tongues meet , and strive as they would sting
 crush out my wind with one straight girting grasp
 stabs on my heart keep time whilst thou dost sing
 thy eyes like searing irons burn out mine
 in thy fair tresses stifle me outright
 like circes , change me to a loathsom swine
 so i may live for ever in thy sight
 into heavens joys can none profoundly see
 except that first they meditate on thee

some praise the looks , and others praise the locks
 of their fair queens , in love with curious words
 some laud the breast where love his treasure locks
 all like the eye that life and love affords
 but none of these frail beauties and unstable
 shall make my pen riot in pompous style
 more greater gifts shall my grave muse enable
 whereat severer brows shall never smile
 i praise her honey sweeter eloquence
 which from the fountain of true wisdom floweth
 her modest mien that matcheth excellence
 her matchless faith which from her virtue groweth
 and could my style her happy virtues equal
 time had no power her glories to enthral

but , ah ! ye maids , beware the gipsy 's lures
 she opens not the womb of time , but yours
 oft has her hands the hapless marian wrung
 marian , whom gay in sweetest strains has sung
 the parson 's maid — sore cause had she to rue
 the gipsy 's tongue ; the parson 's daughter too
 long had that anxious daughter sighed to know
 what vellum 's sprucy clerk , the valley 's beau
 meant by those glances which at church he stole
 her father nodding to the psalm 's slow drawl
 long had she sighed ; at length a prophet came
 by many a sure prediction known to fame
 to marian known , and all she told , for true
 she knew the future , for the past she knew

it hath been heretofore my chance to see
 horsemen with martial order shifting camp
 to onset sallying , or in muster rang 'd
 or in retreat sometimes outstretch 'd for flight
 light armed squadrons and fleet foragers
 scouring thy plains , arezzo ! have i seen
 and clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts
 now with the sound of trumpets , now of bells
 tabors , or signals made from castled heights
 and with inventions multiform , our own
 or introduc 'd from foreign land ; but ne'er
 to such a strange recorder i beheld
 in evolution moving , horse nor foot
 nor ship , that tack 'd by sign from land or star

a host of things i take on trust : i take
 the nightingales on trust , for few and far
 between those actual summer moments are
 when i have heard what melody they make
 so chanced it once at como on the lake
 but all things , then , waxed musical ; each star
 sang on its course , each breeze sang on its car
 all harmonies sang to senses wide awake
 all things in tune , myself not out of tune
 those nightingales were nightingales indeed
 yet truly an owl had satisfied my need
 and wrought a rapture underneath that moon
 or simple sparrow chirping from a reed
 for june that night glowed like a doubled june

yes , nature 's road must ever be preferr 'd
 reason is here no guide , but still a guard
 ‘ tis hers to rectify , not overthrow
 and treat this passion more as friend than foe
 a mightier power the strong direction sends
 and several men impels to several ends
 like varying winds , by other passions tost
 this drives them constant to a certain coast
 let power or knowledge , gold or glory , please
 or ( oft more strong than all ) the love of ease
 through life ‘ tis follow 'd , even at life 's expense
 the merchant 's toil , the sage 's indolence
 the monk 's humility , the hero 's pride
 all , all alike , find reason on their side

art thou already weary of the way
 thou who hast yet but half the way gone o'er
 get up , and lift thy burthen : lo , before
 thy feet the road goes stretching far away
 if thou already faint , who hast but come
 through half thy pilgrimage , with fellows gay
 love , youth , and hope , under the rosy bloom
 and temperate airs , of early breaking day
 look yonder , how the heavens stoop and gloom
 there cease the trees to shade , the flowers to spring
 and the angels leave thee ; what wilt thou become
 through yon drear stretch of dismal wandering
 lonely and dark ? i shall take courage , friend
 for comes not every step more near the end

then tall wak â wa arose and said
 “ brave warriors , listen , and give due heed
 great is hey ó ka , the magical god
 he can walk on the air ; he can float on the flood
 he 's a worker of magic and wonderful wise
 he cries when he laughs and he laughs when he cries
 he sweats when he 's cold , and he shivers when hot
 and the water is cold in his boiling pot
 he hides in the earth and he walks in disguise
 but he loves the brave and their sacrifice
 we are sons of hey ó ka . the giant commands
 in the boiling water to thrust our hands
 and the warrior that scorneth the foe and fire
 hey ó ka will crown with his heart 's desire

if i let fall a word of bitter mirth
 when public shames more shameful pardon won
 some have misjudged me , and my service done
 if small , yet faithful , deemed of little worth
 through veins that drew their life from western earth
 two hundred years and more my blood hath run
 in no polluted course from sire to son
 and thus was i predestined ere my birth
 to love the soil wherewith my fibres own
 instinctive sympathies ; yet love it so
 as honor would , nor lightly to dethrone
 judgment , the stamp of manhood , nor forego
 the son 's right to a mother dearer grown
 with growing knowledge and more chaste than snow

why write i thus ? for souls in heavenly bliss
 feel not our woes — know not what sorrow is
 unless their past experiences they feel
 to aid , by contrast , in producing weal
 for it is written , “ god shall wipe away
 tears from all faces , ” in eternal day
 then let me rest content , and strive to show
 true patience , while i suffer here below
 and follow christ wherever he may lead
 thus proving faith sincere by every deed
 o , then , whenever he may call me hence
 i shall be willing to leave time and sense
 and mount aloft to dwell with god forever
 to taste that bliss from which naught can me sever

the glorious pourtraict of that angels face
 made to amaze weake mens confused skil
 and this worlds worthlesse glory to embase
 what pen , what pencil !, can expresse her fill
 for though he colours could devize at will
 and eke his learned hand at pleasure guide
 least , trembling , it his workmanship should spill
 yet many wondrous things there are beside
 the sweet eye glaunces , that like arrowes glide
 the charming smiles , that rob sence from the hart
 the lovely pleasance , and the lofty pride
 cannot expressed be by any art
 a greater craftesmans hand thereto doth neede
 that can expresse the life of things indeed

i lived with visions for my company
 instead of men and women , years ago
 and found them gentle mates , nor thought to know
 a sweeter music than they played to me
 but soon their trailing purple was not free
 of this world 's dust , their lutes did silent grow
 and i myself grew faint and blind below
 their vanishing eyes . then thou didst come — to be
 beloved , what they seemed . their shining fronts
 their songs , their splendours , ( better , yet the same
 as river water hallowed into fonts
 met in thee , and from out thee overcame
 my soul with satisfaction of all wants
 because god 's gifts put man 's best dreams to shame

“ ‘ think it not loss of time a while to stay
 tho ’ thy companions chide thy long delay
 tho ’ summon 'd to the seas , tho ’ pleasing gales
 invite thy course , and stretch thy swelling sails
 but beg the sacred priestess to relate
 with willing words , and not to write thy fate
 the fierce italian people she will show
 and all thy wars , and all thy future woe
 and what thou may'st avoid , and what must undergo
 she shall direct thy course , instruct thy mind
 and teach thee how the happy shores to find
 this is what heav'n allows me to relate
 now part in peace ; pursue thy better fate
 and raise , by strength of arms , the trojan state

time , cruel time , come and subdue that brow
 which conquers all but thee , and thee too stays
 as if she were exempt from scythe or bow
 from love or years unsubject to decays
 or art thou grown in league with those fair eyes
 that they may help thee to consume our days
 or dost thou spare her for her cruelties
 being merciless like thee that no man weighs
 and yet thou seest thy power she disobeys
 cares not for thee , but lets thee waste in vain
 and prodigal of hours and years betrays
 beauty and youth t'opinion and disdain
 yet spare her , time ; let her exempted be
 she may become more kind to thee or me

is that a swan that rides upon the water
 oh no , it is that other gentle bird
 which is the patron of our noble calling
 i well remember , in my early years
 when these young hands first closed upon a goose
 i have a scar upon my thimble finger
 which chronicles the hour of young ambition
 my father was a tailor , and his father
 and my sire 's grandsire , all of them were tailors
 they had an ancient goose ,— it was an heirloom
 from some remoter tailor of our race
 it happened i did see it on a time
 when none was near , and i did deal with it
 and it did burn me ,— oh , most fearfully

and have i heard her say , “ o cruel pain
 and doth she know what mould her beauty bears
 mourns she in truth , and thinks that others feign
 fears she to feel , and feels not others ’ fears
 or doth she think all pain the mind forbears
 that heavy earth , not fiery spirits , may plain
 that eyes weep worse than heart in bloody tears
 that sense feels more than what doth sense contain
 no , no , she is too wise , she knows her face
 hath not such pain as it makes others have
 she knows the sickness of that perfect place
 hath yet such health , as it my life can save
 but this , she thinks , our pain high cause excuseth
 where her , who should rule pain , false pain abuseth

thro ’ changing months a well attemper 'd mind
 welcomes their gentle or terrific pace
 when o'er retreating autumn 's golden grace
 tempestuous winter spreads in every wind
 naked asperity , our musings find
 grandeur increasing , as the glooms efface
 variety and glow .— each solemn trace
 exalts the thoughts , from sensual joys refin 'd
 then blended in our rapt ideas rise
 the vanish 'd charms , that summer suns reveal
 with all of desolation , that now lies
 dreary before us ;— teach the soul to feel
 awe in the present , pleasure in the past
 and to see vernal morns in hope 's perspective cast

how beautiful it is to wake at night
 another night , in darkness yet more still
 save when the myriad leaves on full fledged boughs
 filled rather by the perfume 's wandering flood
 than by dispansion of the still sweet air
 shall from the furthest utter silences
 in glimmering secrecy have gathered up
 an host of whisperings and scattered sighs
 to loose at last a sound as of the plunge
 and lapsing seethe of some pacific wave
 which , risen from the star thronged outer troughs
 rolls in to wreathe with circling foam away
 the flutter of the golden moths that haunt
 the star 's one glimmer daggered on wet sands

safe from the storm ; the harbor lights of peace
 before his eyes ; the burden of dark fears
 cast from him like a cloak ; and in his ears
 the heart beat music of a great release
 captain and pilot , back upon the seas
 whose wrath he 'd weathered , back he looks with tears
 seeing no shadow of the death that nears
 stealthy and sure , with sudden agonies
 so let him stand , brother to every man
 ready for toil or battle ; he who held
 a nation 's destinies within his hand
 type of our greatness ; first american
 by whom the hearts of all men are compelled
 and with whose name freedom unites our land

and if with thee some hapless maid should stray
 disastrous love companion of her way
 oh , lead her timid steps to yonder glade
 whose arching cliffs depending alders shade
 there , as meek evening wakes her temperate breeze
 and moonbeams glimmer through the trembling trees
 the rills that gurgle round shall soothe her ear
 the weeping rocks shall number tear for tear
 there as sad philomel , alike forlorn
 sings to the night from her accustomed thorn
 while at sweet intervals each falling note
 sighs in the gale , and whispers round the grot
 the sister woe shall calm her aching breast
 and softer slumbers steal her cares to rest

“ teacups , arouse ! ” ‘ t was thus the spell i broke
 the drowsy started and the slumberers woke
 “ the sleep i promised you have now enjoyed
 due to your hour of labor well employed
 swiftly the busy moments have been passed
 this , our first ‘ teacups , ’ must not be our last
 here , on this spot , now consecrated ground
 the order of ‘ the teacups ’ let us found
 by winter 's fireside and in summer 's bower
 still shall it claim its ever welcome hour
 in distant regions where our feet may roam
 the magic teapot find or make a home
 long may its floods their bright infusion pour
 till time and teacups both shall be no more

not so , replied the disappointed dame
 we 'll put it off :— perhaps ‘ twould hurt your frame
 your health i value , and i would advise
 to be at ease , take breath , and prudence prize
 apprentice in a shop you now are bound
 next ‘ prentice go to some gallant around
 you 'll not so soon his pleasing art require
 nor to your tutorage can i now aspire
 friend nicaise take some neighb'ring servant maid
 you 're quite a master in the shopping trade
 stuffs you can sell , and ask the highest price
 and to advantage turn things in a trice
 but opportunity you can n't discern
 to know its value ,— prithee go and learn

and wilt thou have me fashion into speech
 the love i bear thee , finding words enough
 and hold the torch out , while the winds are rough
 between our faces , to cast light on each
 i drop it at thy feet . i cannot teach
 my hand to hold my spirits so far off
 from myself — me — that i should bring thee proof
 in words , of love hid in me out of reach
 nay , let the silence of my womanhood
 commend my woman love to thy belief
 seeing that i stand unwon , however wooed
 and rend the garment of my life , in brief
 by a most dauntless , voiceless fortitude
 lest one touch of this heart convey its grief

fayre bosome ! fraught with vertues richest tresure
 the neast of love , the lodging of delight
 the bowre of blisse , the paradice of pleasure
 the sacred harbour of that hevenly spright
 how was i ravisht with your lovely sight
 and my frayle thoughts too rashly led astray
 whiles diving deepe through amorous insight
 on the sweet spoyle of beautie they did pray
 and twixt her paps , like early fruit in may
 whose harvest seemd to hasten now apace
 they loosely did theyr wanton winges display
 and there to rest themselves did boldly place
 sweet thoughts ! i envy your so happy rest
 which oft i wisht , yet never was so blest

to gasperin 's so often went our wight
 the wife at length became his sole delight
 whose youth and beauty were by all confessed
 but , ‘ midst these charms , such av'rice she possessed
 the warmest love was checked — a thing not rare
 in modern times at least , among the fair
 ‘ tis true , as i 've already said , with such
 sighs naught avail , and promises not much
 without a purse , who wishes should express
 would vainly hope to gain a soft caress
 the god of love no other charm employs
 then cards , and dress , and pleasure 's cheering joys
 from whose gay shops more cuckolds we behold
 than heroes sallied from troy 's horse of old

down in a valley , by a forest 's side
 near where the crystal thames rolls on her waves
 i saw a mushroom stand in haughty pride
 as if the lilies grew to be his slaves
 the gentle daisy , with her silver crown
 worn in the breast of many a shepherd 's lass
 the humble violet , that lowly down
 salutes the gay nymphs as they trimly pass
 these , with a many more , methought , complain 'd
 that nature should those needless things produce
 which not alone the sun from others gain 'd
 but turn it wholly to their proper use
 i could not choose but grieve that nature made
 so glorious flowers to live in such a shade

wilt thou be still unkind and kill me so
 whose humbled vows with sorrowful appeal
 do still persist , and did so long ago
 intreat for pity with so pure a zeal
 suffice the world shall , for the world can say
 how much thy power hath power , and what it can
 never was victor hand yet moved to slay
 the rendered captive , or the yielding man
 then , o , why should thy woman thought impose
 death and disdain on him that yields his breath
 to free his soul from discontent and woes
 and humble sacrifice to a certain death
 o since the world knows what the power can do
 what were't for thee to save and love me too

my soul is a stiff pageant , man by man
 of some egyptian art than egypt older
 found in some tomb whose rite no guess can scan
 where all things else to coloured dust did moulder
 whate ’ er its sense may mean , its age is twin
 to that of priesthoods whose feet stood near god
 when knowledge was so great that ’ twas a sin
 and man ’ s mere soul too man for its abode
 but when i ask what means that pageant i
 and would look at it suddenly , i lose
 the sense i had of seeing it , nor can try
 again to look , nor hath my memory a use
 that seems recalling , save that it recalls
 an emptiness of having seen those walls

the key will stammer , and the door reply
 the hall wake , yawn , and smile ; the torpid stair
 will grumble at our feet , the table cry
 ‘ fetch my belongings for me ; i am bare
 a clatter ! something in the attic falls
 a ghost has lifted up his robes and fled
 the loitering shadows move along the walls
 then silence very slowly lifts his head
 the starling with impatient screech has flown
 the chimney , and is watching from the tree
 they thought us gone for ever : mouse alone
 stops in the middle of the floor to see
 now all you idle things , resume your toil
 hearth , put your flames on . sulky kettle , boil

i do not care for kisses . ‘ tis a debt
 we paid for the first privilege of love
 these are the rains of april which have wet
 our fallow hearts and forced their germs to move
 now the green corn has sprouted . each new day
 brings better pleasures , a more dear surprise
 the blade , the ear , the harvest — and our way
 leads through a region wealthy grown and wise
 we now compare our fortunes . each his store
 displays to kindred eyes of garnered grain
 two happy farmers , learned in love 's lore
 who weigh and touch and argue and complain
 dear endless argument ! yet sometimes we
 even as we argue kiss . there ! let it be

whenas her lute is tun è d to her voice
 the air grows proud for honour of that sound
 and rocks do leap to show how they rejoice
 that in the earth such music should be found
 whenas her hair more worth , more pale than gold
 like silver thread lies wafting in the air
 diana like she looks , but yet more bold
 cruel in chase , more chaste and yet more fair
 whenas she smiles , the clouds for envy breaks
 she jove in pride encounters with a check
 the sun doth shine for joy whenas she speaks
 thus heaven and earth do homage at her beck
 yet all these graces , blots , not graces are
 if you , my love , of love do take no care

this bronze doth keep the very form and mold
 of our great martyr 's face . yes , this is he
 that brow all wisdom , all benignity
 that human , humorous mouth ; those cheeks that hold
 like some harsh landscape all the summer 's gold
 that spirit fit for sorrow , as the sea
 for storms to beat on ; the lone agony
 those silent , patient lips too well foretold
 yes , this is he who ruled a world of men
 as might some prophet of the elder day
 brooding above the tempest and the fray
 with deep eyed thought and more than mortal ken
 a power was his beyond the touch of art
 or armed strength — his pure and mighty heart

how heavy do i journey on the way
 when what i seek ( my weary travel 's end
 doth teach that case and that repose to say
 ‘ thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
 the beast that bears me , tired with my woe
 plods dully on , to bear that weight in me
 as if by some instinct the wretch did know
 his rider loved not speed being made from thee
 the bloody spur cannot provoke him on
 that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
 which heavily he answers with a groan
 more sharp to me than spurring to his side
 for that same groan doth put this in my mind
 my grief lies onward and my joy behind

‘ o child , when my words your sweet youth beguil 'd
 i meant to make you the happiest child
 i meant that no earthly life should be known
 as bless 'd as the life i had made my own
 my weakness and follies i had forgot
 but you were happy with me , were you not
 i am not worthy my love should come
 forsaking for my sake her english home
 exiled from all that is happy and good
 caress 'd by a hand that is stain 'd with blood
 your innocent face shall never be kiss 'd
 by him who his heaven and hope has miss 'd
 i suffer for sin , as i ought to do
 but , my darling , it shall not fall on you

i do not care to talk to you although
 your speech evokes a thousand sympathies
 and all my being 's silent harmonies
 wake trembling into music . when you go
 it is as if some sudden , dreadful blow
 had severed all the strings with savage ease
 no , do not talk ; but let us rather seize
 this intimate gift of silence which we know
 others may guess your thoughts from what you say
 as storms are guessed from clouds where darkness broods
 to me the very essence of the day
 reveals its inner purpose and its moods
 as poplars feel the rain and then straightway
 reverse their leaves and shimmer through the woods

why died i not whenas i last did sleep
 o sleep too short that shadowed forth my dear
 heavens , hear my prayers , nor thus me waking keep
 for this were heaven , if thus i sleeping were
 for in that dark there shone a princely light
 two milk white hills , both full of nectar sweet
 her ebon thighs , the wonder of my sight
 where all my senses with their objects meet
 i pass these sports , in secret that are best
 wherein my thoughts did seem alive to be
 we both did strive , and weary both did rest
 i kissed her still , and still she kiss è d me
 heavens , let me sleep , and shows my senses feed
 or let me wake and happy be indeed

what ! and shall we , with such submissive airs
 as age demands in reverence from the young
 await these crumbs of praise from europe flung
 and doubt of our own greatness till it bears
 the signet of your goethes or voltaires
 we who alone in latter times have sung
 with scarce less power than arno 's exiled tongue
 we who are milton 's kindred , shakespeare 's heirs
 the prize of lyric victory who shall gain
 if ours be not the laurel , ours the palm
 more than the froth and flotsam of the seine
 more than your hugo flare against the night
 and more than weimar 's proud elaborate calm
 one flash of byron 's lightning , wordsworth 's light

france , cloven in twain by fire of hell and hate
 shamed with the shame of men her meanest born
 soldier and judge whose names , inscribed for scorn
 stand vilest on the record writ of fate
 lies yet not wholly vile who stood so great
 sees yet not all her praise of old outworn
 not yet is all her scroll of glory torn
 or left for utter shame to desecrate
 high souls and constant hearts of faithful men
 sustain her perfect praise with tongue and pen
 indomitable as honour . storms may toss
 and soil her standard ere her bark win home
 but shame falls full upon the christless cross
 whose brandmark signs the holy hounds of rome

read in my face a volume of despairs
 the wailing iliads of my tragic woe
 drawn with my blood , and painted with my cares
 wrought by her hand that i have honoured so
 who whilst i burn , she sings at my soul 's wrack
 looking aloft from turret of her pride
 there my soul 's tyrant joys her in the sack
 of her own seat , whereof i made her guide
 there do these smokes that from affliction rise
 serve as an incense to a cruel dame
 a sacrifice thrice grateful to her eyes
 because their power serves to exact the same
 thus ruins she to satisfy her will
 the temple where her name was honoured still

let me confess that we two must be twain
 although our undivided loves are one
 so shall those blots that do with me remain
 without thy help , by me be borne alone
 in our two loves there is but one respect
 though in our lives a separable spite
 which though it alter not love 's sole effect
 yet doth it steal sweet hours from love 's delight
 i may not evermore acknowledge thee
 lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
 nor thou with public kindness honour me
 unless thou take that honour from thy name
 but do not so , i love thee in such sort
 as thou being mine , mine is thy good report

upon a cloud among the stars we stood
 the angel raised his hand and looked and said
 “ which world , of all yon starry myriad
 shall we make wing to ? ” the still solitude
 became a harp whereon his voice and mood
 made spheral music round his haloed head
 i spake — for then i had not long been dead
 “ let me look round upon the vasts , and brood
 a moment on these orbs ere i decide
 what is yon lower star that beauteous shines
 and with soft splendor now incarnadines
 our wings ?— there would i go and there abide
 he smiled as one who some child 's thought divines
 “ that is the world where yesternight you died

i am a little world , made cunningly
 of elements and an angelic sprite
 but black sin hath betrayed to endless night
 my world 's both parts , and oh ! both parts must die
 you , which beyond that heaven , which was most high
 have found new spheres , and of new land can write
 pour new seas in mine eyes , that so i might
 drown my world with my weeping earnestly
 or wash it , if it must be drowned no more
 but oh ! it must be burnt ; alas ! the fire
 of lust and envy burnt it heretofore
 and made it fouler ; let their flames retire
 and burn me , o lord ! with a fiery zeal
 of thee and thy house , which doth in eating heal

then thus to phoebus , in the realms above
 spoke from his throne the cloud compelling jove
 “ descend , my phoebus ! on the phrygian plain
 and from the fight convey sarpedon slain
 then bathe his body in the crystal flood
 with dust dishonour ’ d , and deform ’ d with blood
 o ’ er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed
 and with celestial robes adorn the dead
 those rites discharged , his sacred corse bequeath
 to the soft arms of silent sleep and death
 they to his friends the immortal charge shall bear
 his friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear
 what honour mortals after death receive
 those unavailing honours we may give

between two seas the sea bird 's wing makes halt
 wind weary ; while with lifting head he waits
 for breath to reinspire him from the gates
 that open still toward sunrise on the vault
 high domed of morning , and in flight 's default
 with spreading sense of spirit anticipates
 what new sea now may lure beyond the straits
 his wings exulting that her winds exalt
 and fill them full as sails to seaward spread
 fulfilled with fair speed 's promise . pass , my song
 forth to the haven of thy desire and dread
 the presence of our lord , long loved and long
 far off above beholden , who to thee
 was as light kindling all a windy sea

the orient beam illumes the parting oar
 from yonder azure track , emerging white
 the earliest sail slow gains upon the sight
 and the blue wave comes rippling to the shore
 meantime far off the rear of darkness flies
 yet ‘ mid the beauties of the morn , unmoved
 like one for ever torn from all he loved
 back o'er the deep i turn my longing eyes
 and chide the wayward passions that rebel
 yet boots it not to think , or to complain
 musing sad ditties to the reckless main
 to dreams like these , adieu ! the pealing bell
 speaks of the hour that stays not — and the day
 to life 's sad turmoil calls my heart away

if the blinde furie which warres breedeth oft
 wonts not t'enrage the hearts of equall beasts
 whether they fare on foote , or flie aloft
 or armed be with clawes , or scalie creasts
 what fell erynnis , with hot burning tongs
 did grype your hearts with noysome rage imbew 'd
 that , each to other working cruell wrongs
 your blades in your owne bowels you embrew 'd
 was this , ye romanes , your hard destinie
 or some old sinne , whose unappeased guilt
 powr 'd vengeance forth on you eternallie
 or brothers blood , the which at first was spilt
 upon your walls , that god might not endure
 upon the same to set foundation sure

at sultry noon too , when our toils were done
 we to the gloomy glen were wont to run
 there on the turf we lay , while at our feet
 the cooling rivulet rippled softly sweet
 and mused on holy theme , and ancient lore
 of deeds , and days , and heroes now no more
 heard , as his solemn harp isaiah swept
 sung woe unto the wicked land — and wept
 or , fancy led , saw jeremiah mourn
 in solemn sorrow o'er judea 's urn
 then to another shore perhaps would rove
 with plato talk in his ilyssian grove
 or , wandering where the thespian palace rose
 weep once again o'er fair jocasta 's woes

if thou hadst been a sculptor , what a race
 of forms divine had thenceforth filled the land
 methinks i see thee , glorious workman , stand
 striking a marble window through blind space
 thy face 's reflex on the coming face
 as dawns the stone to statue ‘ neath thy hand
 body obedient to its soul 's command
 which is thy thought , informing it with grace
 so had it been . but god , who quickeneth clay
 nor turneth it to marble — maketh eyes
 not shadowy hollows , where no sunbeams play
 would mould his loftiest thought in human guise
 thou didst appear , walking unknown abroad
 god 's living sculpture , all informed of god

o ! it is pleasant , with a heart at ease
 just after sunset , or by moonlight skies
 to make the shifting clouds be what you please
 or let the easily persuaded eyes
 own each quaint likeness issuing from the mould
 of a friend 's fancy ; or with head bent low
 and cheek aslant see rivers flow of gold
 ‘ twixt crimson banks ; and then , a traveller , go
 from mount to mount through cloudland , gorgeous land
 or list'ning to the tide , with clos é d sight
 be that blind bard , who on the chian strand
 by those deep sounds possessed with inward light
 beheld the iliad and the odyssee
 rise to the swelling of the voiceful sea

those lines that i before have writ do lie
 even those that said i could not love you dearer
 yet then my judgment knew no reason why
 my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
 but reckoning time , whose millioned accidents
 creep in ‘ twixt vows , and change decrees of kings
 tan sacred beauty , blunt the sharp'st intents
 divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things
 alas why fearing of time 's tyranny
 might i not then say ‘ now i love you best
 when i was certain o'er incertainty
 crowning the present , doubting of the rest
 love is a babe , then might i not say so
 to give full growth to that which still doth grow

no sooner on my vision streaming , smote
 the heav'nly influence , which years past , and e'en
 in childhood , thrill 'd me , than towards virgil i
 turn 'd me to leftward , panting , like a babe
 that flees for refuge to his mother 's breast
 if aught have terrified or work 'd him woe
 and would have cried : “ there is no dram of blood
 that doth not quiver in me . the old flame
 throws out clear tokens of reviving fire
 but virgil had bereav 'd us of himself
 virgil , my best lov 'd father ; virgil , he
 to whom i gave me up for safety : nor
 all , our prime mother lost , avail 'd to save
 my undew 'd cheeks from blur of soiling tears

o garden isle , beloved by sun and sea
 whose bluest billows kiss thy curving bays
 whose light infolds thy hills with golden rays
 filling with fruit each dark leaved orange tree
 what hidden hatred hath the earth for thee
 that once again , in these dark , dreadful days
 breaks forth in trembling rage , and swiftly lays
 thy beauty waste in wreck and agony
 is nature , then , a strife of jealous powers
 and man the plaything of unconscious fate
 not so , my troubled heart ! god reigns above
 and man is greatest in his darkest hours
 walking amid the cities desolate
 behold the son of god in human love

so in their hearts the nymphs spake : but they twain
 burned on the pyre , never to hail again
 the dayspring . wondering herdmen stood around
 as once the thronging argives marvelling saw
 evadne clasping mid the fire her lord
 capaneus , slain by zeus ’ dread thunderbolt
 but when the blast of the devouring fire
 had made twain one , oenone and paris , now
 one little heap of ashes , then with wine
 quenched they the embers , and they laid their bones
 in a wide golden vase , and round them piled
 the earth mound ; and they set two pillars there
 that each from other ever turn away
 for the old jealousy in the marble lives

oft as by chance , a little while apart
 the pall of empty , loveless hours withdrawn
 sweet beauty , opening on the impoverished heart
 beams like the jewel on the breast of dawn
 not though high heaven should rend would deeper awe
 fill me than penetrates my spirit thus
 nor all those signs the patmian prophet saw
 seem a new heaven and earth so marvelous
 but , clad thenceforth in iridescent dyes
 the fair world glistens , and in after days
 the memory of kind lips and laughing eyes
 lives in my step and lightens all my face
 so they who found the earthly paradise
 still breathed , returned , of that sweet , joyful place

“ i ceased , when affable the goddess cried
 ‘ observe , and in the truths i speak confide
 the oracular seer frequents the pharian coast
 from whose high bed my birth divine i boast
 proteus , a name tremendous o'er the main
 the delegate of neptune 's watery reign
 watch with insidious care his known abode
 there fast in chains constrain the various god
 who bound , obedient to superior force
 unerring will prescribe your destined course
 if , studious on your realms , you then demand
 their state , since last you left your natal land
 instant the god obsequious will disclose
 bright tracts of glory or a cloud of woes

“ why art thou sad , my soul ? the eye divine
 still looks on all ; to grieve is to repine
 and tho ’ destruction cover all the shore
 tho ’ heroes , kings , and statesmen be no more
 tho ’ stenon , vainly mild , and vainly brave
 fill the dark bosom of the dreary grave
 tho ’ sweden 's sons no earthly hope retain
 tho ’ not one spark of ancient fire remain
 tho ’ hostile banners crowd her blazing sky
 and stretch 'd in dust her smoking castles lie
 yet , lord of all ! from ruin 's blackening ware
 thy arm is till omnipotent to save
 thy arm can stop the whirlwind 's rushing breath
 and light with hope the funeral shades of death

“ long as ‘ t is lawful for me , shall my steps
 follow on thine ; and since the cloudy smoke
 forbids the seeing , hearing in its stead
 shall keep us join 'd . ” i then forthwith began
 “ yet in my mortal swathing , i ascend
 to higher regions , and am hither come
 through the fearful agony of hell
 and , if so largely god hath doled his grace
 that , clean beside all modern precedent
 he wills me to behold his kingly state
 from me conceal not who thou wast , ere death
 had loos 'd thee ; but instruct me : and instruct
 if rightly to the pass i tend ; thy words
 the way directing as a safe escort

“ o never , never more let king be just
 be mild in power , or faithful to his trust
 let tyrants govern with an iron rod
 oppress , destroy , and be the scourge of god
 since he who like a father held his reign
 so soon forgot , was just and mild in vain
 true , while my friend is grieved , his griefs i share
 yet now the rivals are my smallest care
 they for the mighty mischiefs they devise
 ere long shall pay — their forfeit lives the price
 but against you , ye greeks ! ye coward train
 gods ! how my soul is moved with just disdain
 dumb ye all stand , and not one tongue affords
 his injured prince the little aid of words

juno and pallas grieving hear the doom
 but feast their souls on ilion ’ s woes to come
 though secret anger swell ’ d minerva ’ s breast
 the prudent goddess yet her wrath repress ’ d
 but juno , impotent of rage , replies
 “ what hast thou said , o tyrant of the skies
 strength and omnipotence invest thy throne
 ’ tis thine to punish ; ours to grieve alone
 for greece we grieve , abandon ’ d by her fate
 to drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate
 from fields forbidden we submiss refrain
 with arms unaiding see our argives slain
 yet grant our counsels still their breasts may move
 lest all should perish in the rage of jove

now being on the eve of death , discharged
 from every mortal hope and earthly care
 i questioned how my soul might best employ
 this hand , and this still wakeful flame of mind
 in the brief hours yet left me for their use
 wherefore have i bethought me of my friend
 of you , philarchus , and your company
 yet wavering in the faith and unconfirmed
 perchance that i may break into thine heart
 some sorrowful channel for the love divine
 i make this simple record of our proof
 in diverse sufferings for the name of christ
 whereof the end already for the most
 is death this day with steadfast faith endured

such sympathies the glorious bard endear
 thus fair he walks in man 's diurnal sphere
 but when , upborne on bright invention 's wings
 he dares the realms of uncreated things
 forms more divine , more dreadful , start to view
 than ever hades or olympus knew
 round the dark cauldron , terrible and fell
 the midnight witches breathe the songs of hell
 delighted ariel wings his fiery way
 to whirl the storm , the wheeling orbs to stay
 then bathes in honey dews , and sleeps in flowers
 meanwhile , young oberon , girt with shadowy powers
 pursues o'er ocean 's verge the pale cold moon
 or hymns her , riding in her highest noon

tread softly ! all the earth is holy ground
 it may be , could we look with seeing eyes
 this spot we stand on is a paradise
 where dead have come to life and lost been found
 where faith has triumphed , martyrdom been crowned
 where fools have foiled the wisdom of the wise
 from this same spot the dust of saints may rise
 and the king 's prisoners come to light unbound
 o earth , earth , earth , hear thou thy maker 's word
 “ thy dead thou shalt give up , nor hide thy slain
 some who went weeping forth shall come again
 rejoicing from the east or from the west
 as doves fly to their windows , love 's own bird
 contented and desirous to the nest

he came , a youth , singing in the dawn
 of a new freedom , glowing o'er his lyre
 refining , as with great apollo 's fire
 his people 's gift of song . and thereupon
 this negro singer , come to helicon
 constrained the masters , listening to admire
 and roused a race to wonder and aspire
 gazing which way their honest voice was gone
 with ebon face uplit of glory 's crest
 men marveled at the singer , strong and sweet
 who brought the cabin 's mirth , the tuneful night
 but faced the morning , beautiful with light
 to die while shadows yet fell toward the west
 and leave his laurels at his people 's feet

in vain to deserts thy retreat is made
 the muse attends thee to thy silent shade
 ‘ tis hers the brave man 's latest steps to trace
 rejudge his acts , and dignify disgrace
 when interest calls off all her sneaking train
 and all the obliged desert , and all the vain
 she waits , or to the scaffold , or the cell
 when the last lingering friend has bid farewell
 even now she shades thy evening walk with bays
 ( no hireling she , no prostitute to praise
 even now , observant of the parting ray
 eyes the calm sunset of thy various day
 through fortune 's cloud one truly great can see
 nor fears to tell that mortimer is he

he spoke ; when behren 's pass before them lay
 and moving nations on the margin stray
 thick swarming , venturous ; sail and oar they ply
 climb on the surge and o'er the billows fly
 as when autumnal storms awake their force
 the storks foreboding tempt their southern course
 from all the fields collecting throngs arise
 mount on the wing and crowd along the skies
 thus , to his eye , from bleak tartaria 's shore
 thro isles and seas , the gathering people pour
 change their cold regions for a happier strand
 leap from the wave and tread the welcome land
 in growing tribes extend their southern sway
 and wander wide beneath a warmer day

is it your heart i hear beneath me
 or the far tolling of that tower
 the voices are still that cried around us
 the woods grow still for the sacred hour
 rise , white lover ! the day draws near
 the grey trees lean to the east in fear
 ‘ by the clear waters where once i died
 beloved , whose voice was this that cried
 ‘ by the clear waters that reach the sun
 by the clear waves that starward run
 i found love 's body and lost his soul
 and crumbled in flame that should have annealed
 how shall i ever again be whole
 by what dark waters shall i be healed

he saw at once , as far as eye could rove
 like scattering herds , the swarthy people move
 in tribes innumerable ; all the waste
 wide as their walks , a varying shadow cast
 as airy shapes , beneath the moon 's pale eye
 people the clouds that sail the midnight sky
 dance thro the grove and flit along the glade
 and cast their grisly phantoms on the shade
 so move the hordes , in thickets half conceal 'd
 or vagrant stalking thro the fenceless field
 here tribes untamed , who scorn to fix their home
 o'er shadowy streams and trackless deserts roam
 while others there in settled hamlets rest
 and corn clad vales a happier state attest

two loves i have , of comfort and despair
 that like two spirits do suggest me still
 my better angel is a man right fair
 my worser spirit a woman colour 'd ill
 to win me soon to hell , my female evil
 tempteth my better angel from my side
 and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
 wooing his purity with her fair pride
 and whether that my angel be turn 'd fiend
 suspect i may , yet not directly tell
 for being both to me , both to each friend
 i guess one angel in another 's hell
 the truth i shall not know , but live in doubt
 till my bad angel fire my good one out

stabb ’ d at the sight , deiphobus drew nigh
 and made , with force , the vengeful weapon fly
 the cretan saw ; and , stooping , caused to glance
 from his slope shield the disappointed lance
 beneath the spacious targe , ( a blazing round
 thick with bull hides and brazen orbits bound
 on his raised arm by two strong braces stay ’ d
 he lay collected in defensive shade
 o ’ er his safe head the javelin idly sung
 and on the tinkling verge more faintly rung
 even then the spear the vigorous arm confess ’ d
 and pierced , obliquely , king hypsenor ’ s breast
 warm ’ d in his liver , to the ground it bore
 the chief , his people ’ s guardian now no more

o nothing , in this corporal earth of man
 that to the imminent heaven of his high soul
 responds with colour and with shadow , can
 lack correlated greatness . if the scroll
 where thoughts lie fast in spell of hieroglyph
 be mighty through its mighty habitants
 if god be in his name ; grave potence if
 the sounds unbind of hieratic chants
 all 's vast that vastness means . nay , i affirm
 nature is whole in her least things exprest
 nor know we with what scope god builds the worm
 our towns are copied fragments from our breast
 and all man 's babylons strive but to impart
 the grandeurs of his babylonian heart

nay , we are children : we will not mature
 a blessed gift must seem a theft ; and tears
 must storm our eyes when but a joy appears
 in drear disguise of sorrow ; and how poor
 we seem when we are richest ,— most secure
 against all poverty the lifelong years
 we yet must waste in childish doubts and fears
 that , in despite of reason , still endure
 alas ! the sermon of the rose we will
 not wisely ponder ; nor the sobs of grief
 lulled into sighs of rapture ; nor the cry
 of fierce defiance that again is still
 be patient — patient with our frail belief
 and stay it yet a little ere we die

in this dark age tho blinded faction sways
 and wealth and conquest gain the palm of praise
 awed into slaves while groveling millions groan
 and blood stain 'd steps lead upward to a throne
 far other wreaths thy virtuous temples twine
 far nobler triumphs crown a life like thine
 thine be the joys that minds immortal grace
 as thine the deeds that bless a kindred race
 now raise thy sorrowed soul to views more bright
 the vision 'd ages rushing on thy sight
 worlds beyond worlds shall bring to light their stores
 time , nature , science blend their utmost powers
 to show , concentred in one blaze of fame
 the ungather 'd glories that await thy name

those snary locks are those same nets , my dear
 wherewith my liberty thou didst surprise
 love was the flame that fir è d me so near
 the dart transpiercing were those crystal eyes
 strong is the net , and fervent is the flame
 deep is the wound my sighs can well report
 yet i do love , adore , and praise the same
 that holds , that burns , that wounds in this sort
 and list not seek to break , to quench , to heal
 the bond , the flame , the wound that festereth so
 by knife , by liquor , or by salve to deal
 so much i please to perish in my woe
 yet lest long travails be above my strength
 good delia , loose , quench , heal me , now at length

father , part of his double interest
 unto thy kingdom thy son gives to me
 his jointure in the knotty trinity
 he keeps , and gives to me his death 's conquest
 this lamb , whose death with life the world hath blest
 was from the world 's beginning slain , and he
 hath made two wills , which , with the legacy
 of his and thy kingdom , thy sons invest
 yet such are these laws , that men argue yet
 whether a man those statutes can fulfil
 none doth ; but thy all healing grace and spirit
 revive again what law and letter kill
 thy law 's abridgment and thy last command
 is all but love ; oh , let this last will stand

cloud topped and splendid , dominating all
 the little lesser hills which compass thee
 thou standest , bright with april 's buoyancy
 yet holding winter in some shaded wall
 of stern , steep rock ; and startled by the call
 of spring , thy trees flush with expectancy
 and cast a cloud of crimson , silently
 above thy snowy crevices where fall
 pale shrivelled oak leaves , while the snow beneath
 melts at their phantom touch . another year
 is quick with import . such each year has been
 unmoved thou watchest all , and all bequeath
 some jewel to thy diadem of power
 thou pledge of greater majesty unseen

you , meanwhile , where drenched you stand
 awaken once more to the rush and roar
 and on the rock point tighten your hand
 as you turn and see a valley deep
 that was not there a moment before
 suck rattling down between you and a heap
 of toppling billow , whose instant fall
 must sink the whole island once for all
 or watch the silenter , stealthier seas
 feeling their way to you more and more
 if they once should clutch you high as the knees
 they would whirl you down like a sprig of kelp
 beyond all reach of hope or help
 and such in a storm is appledore

my lady 's presence makes the roses red
 because to see her lips they blush with shame
 the lily 's leaves for envy pale became
 and her white hands in them this envy bred
 the marigold the leaves abroad doth spread
 because the sun 's and her power is the same
 the violet of purple colour came
 dyed in the blood she made my heart to shed
 in brief , all flowers from her their virtue take
 from her sweet breath their sweet smells do proceed
 the living heat which her eyebeams doth make
 warmeth the ground and quickeneth the seed
 the rain wherewith she watereth the flowers
 falls from mine eyes which she dissolves in showers

lady of ladies , the delight alone
 for which to heaven earth doth no envy bear
 seeing and hearing thee , we see and hear
 such voice , such light , as never sung nor shone
 the want of heaven i grant yet we may moan
 not for the pleasure of the angels there
 as though in face or voice they like thee were
 but that they many be , and thou but one
 the basest notes which from thy voice proceed
 the treble of the angels do exceed
 so that i fear their choir to beautify
 lest thou to some in heaven shall sing and shine
 lo , when i hear thee sing , the reason why
 sighs of my breast keep time with notes of thine

witless of this sad deed , and absent far
 fierce meleager , with the self same fire
 burn 'd inward ; all his vitals felt the flame
 scorching conceal 'd : th ’ excruciating pangs
 magnanimous he bore . yet deep he mourn 'd
 by such a slothful bloodless fate to fall
 and happy call 'd anc æ us in his wounds
 with deep drawn groans he calls his aged sire
 his brother , sisters , and the nymph belov 'd
 who shar 'd his nuptial couch ; with final breath
 his mother too perchance . now glows the fire
 and now the pains increase ; now both are faint
 now both together die . the soul flies forth
 and gently dissipates in empty air

keen , fitful gusts are whisp'ring here and there
 among the bushes half leafless , and dry
 the stars look very cold about the sky
 and i have many miles on foot to fare
 yet feel i little of the cool bleak air
 or of the dead leaves rustling drearily
 or of those silver lamps that burn on high
 or of the distance from home 's pleasant lair
 for i am brimfull of the friendliness
 that in a little cottage i have found
 of fair hair 'd milton 's eloquent distress
 and all his love for gentle lycid drown 'd
 of lovely laura in her light green dress
 and faithful petrarch gloriously crown 'd

“ the two beloved ones left alone , each day
 grieved more and more until in peace at last
 the bounding line of life was safely past
 and all their sorrow then was put away
 they pined in vain for that dear birdling flown
 who , with swift wings had left them there alone
 yet oft in gentle tones they spoke of thee
 and longed they fair , young face once more to see
 unto our far off shore there sometimes came
 faint rumors of thy longed for , new found fame
 this gave them joy indeed , yet more of pain
 for thus they knew their hopes were all in vain
 allured unto the world was thy young heart
 the gay , bright world in which they had no part

o friend ! i know not which way i must look
 for comfort , being , as i am , opprest
 to think that now our life is only drest
 for shew ; mean handywork of craftsman , cook
 or groom ! we must run glittering like a brook
 in the open sunshine , or we are unblest
 the wealthiest man among us is the best
 no grandeur now in nature or in book
 delights us . rapine , avarice , expence
 this is idolatry ; and these we adore
 plain living and high thinking are no more
 the homely beauty of the good old cause
 is gone ; our peace , our fearful innocence
 and pure religion breathing household laws

“ long as ‘ t is lawful for me , shall my steps
 follow on thine ; and since the cloudy smoke
 forbids the seeing , hearing in its stead
 shall keep us join 'd . ” i then forthwith began
 “ yet in my mortal swathing , i ascend
 to higher regions , and am hither come
 through the fearful agony of hell
 and , if so largely god hath doled his grace
 that , clean beside all modern precedent
 he wills me to behold his kingly state
 from me conceal not who thou wast , ere death
 had loos 'd thee ; but instruct me : and instruct
 if rightly to the pass i tend ; thy words
 the way directing as a safe escort

when garry , who had stanched his wounds , arose
 he seized his axe , and ‘ gan with rapid blows
 to fell down fir trees . through the silent strath
 the hollow echoes rang . with fiendish wrath
 he made resolve to heap the splintered wood
 against the door , and burn the hated brood
 of his tormentors one and all . he hewed
 an ample pyre , then piled it thick and high
 while the sun , sloping to the western sky
 proclaimed the closing of that fateful day
 but the doomed women little dreamed that they
 would have such fearsome end ... as garry lay
 rubbing the firesticks till they ‘ gan to glow
 he heard a fian mother singing low

these words were thunder to belphegor 's ears
 who instantly took flight , so great his fears
 to hell 's abyss he fled without delay
 to tell adventures through the realms of day
 sire , said the demon , it is clearly true
 damnation does the marriage knot pursue
 your highness often hither sees arrive
 not squads , but regiments , who , when alive
 by hymen were indissolubly tied
 in person i the fact have fully tried
 th ’ institution , perhaps , most just could be
 past ages far more happiness might see
 but ev'ry thing , with time , corruption shows
 no jewel in your crown more lustre throws

i met thee like the morning , though more fair
 and hopes ‘ gan travel for a glorious day
 and though night met them ere they were aware
 leading the joyous pilgrims all astray
 yet know i not , though they did miss their way
 that joyed so much to meet thee , if they are
 to blame or bless the fate that bade such be
 thou seem'dst an angel when i met thee first
 nor has aught made thee otherwise to me
 possession has not cloyed my love , nor curst
 fancy 's wild visions with reality
 thou art an angel still ; and hope , awoke
 from the fond spell that early raptures nurst
 still feels a joy to think that spell ne'er broke

alaciel 's story 's of another kind
 and i 've a little altered it , you 'll find
 faults some may see , and others disbelieve
 ‘ tis all the same :— ‘ twill never make me grieve
 alaciel 's mem'ry , it is very clear
 can scarcely by it lose ; there 's naught to fear
 two facts important i have kept in view
 in which the author fully i pursue
 the one — no less than eight the belle possessed
 before a husband 's sight her eyes had blessed
 the other is , the prince she was to wed
 ne'er seemed to heed this trespass on his bed
 but thought , perhaps , the beauty she had got
 would prove to any one a happy lot

when old jack died , we stayed from school ( they said
 at home , we need n't go that day ) , and none
 of us ate any breakfast — only one
 and that was papa — and his eyes were red
 when he came round where we were , by the shed
 where jack was lying , half way in the sun
 and half way in the shade . when we begun
 to cry out loud , pa turned and dropped his head
 and went away ; and mamma , she went back
 into the kitchen . then , for a long while
 all to ourselves , like , we stood there and cried
 we thought so many good things of old jack
 and funny things — although we did n't smile
 we could n't only cry when old jack died

outwearied with the littleness and spite
 the falsehood and the treachery of men
 i cried , “ give me but justice ! ” thinking then
 i meekly craved a common boon which might
 most easily be granted ; soon the light
 of deeper truth grew on my wondering ken
 ( escaping baneful damps of stagnant fen
 and then i saw that in my pride bedight
 i claimed from erring man the gift of heaven
 god 's own great vested right ; and i grew calm
 with folded hands , like stone , to patience given
 and pitying , of pure love distilling balm
 and now i wait in quiet trust to be
 all known to god — and ask of men sweet charity

poet of nature , thou hast wept to know
 that things depart which never may return
 childhood and youth , friendship and love 's first glow
 have fled like sweet dreams , leaving thee to mourn
 these common woes i feel . one loss is mine
 which thou too feel'st , yet i alone deplore
 thou wert as a lone star , whose light did shine
 on some frail bark in winter 's midnight roar
 thou hast like to a rock built refuge stood
 above the blind and battling multitude
 in honoured poverty thy voice did weave
 songs consecrate to truth and liberty
 deserting these , thou leavest me to grieve
 thus having been , that thou shouldst cease to be

and now the board was laid and dressed , and all
 sat down to dinner at the baron 's call
 and gawayne looked along the room askance
 seeking the lady ; and he caught one glance
 of laughing eyes — then looked away in haste
 but turned again , and wondered why his taste
 had erred so strangely , for the lady seemed
 not fairer now than others . had he dreamed
 he rubbed his eyes and pondered ,— though in sooth
 without one glimmering presage of the truth
 till all passed lightly from his puzzled mind
 leaving contentment and good cheer behind
 so all the company feasted well , and sped
 the flying hours , till it was time for bed

now swarms the populace : a countless throng
 youth and boar age ; and man drives man along
 the games begin ; ambitious of the prize
 acroneus , thoon , and eretmeus rise
 the prize ocyalus and prymneus claim
 anchialus and ponteus , chiefs of fame
 there proreus , nautes , eratreus , appear
 and famed amphialus , polyneus ’ heir
 euryalus , like mars terrific , rose
 when clad in wrath he withers hosts of foes
 naubolides with grace unequall 'd shone
 or equall 'd by laodamas alone
 with these came forth ambasineus the strong
 and three brave sons , from great alcinous sprung

seven sweet singing birds up in a tree
 seven swift sailing ships white upon the sea
 seven bright weather cocks shining in the sun
 seven slim race horses ready for a run
 seven golden butterflies flitting overhead
 seven red roses blowing in a garden bed
 seven white lilies , with honey bees inside them
 seven round rainbows , with clouds to divide them
 seven pretty little girls , with sugar on their lips
 seven witty little boys , whom everybody tips
 seven nice fathers , to call little maids joys
 seven nice mothers , to kiss the little boys
 seven nights running i dreamt it all plain
 with bread and jam for supper i could dream it all again

man 's heart may change , but nature 's glory never
 strange features throng around me , and the shore
 is not my own dear land . yet why deplore
 this change of doom ? all mortal ties must sever
 the pang is past ,— and now with blest endeavour
 i check the ready tear , the rising sigh
 the common earth is here — the common sky
 the common father . and how high soever
 o'er other tribes proud england 's hosts may seem
 god 's children , fair or sable , equal find
 a father 's love . then learn , o man , to deem
 all difference idle save of heart or mind
 thy duty , love — each cause of strife , a dream
 thy home , the world — thy family , mankind

when younglings first on cupid fix their sight
 and see him naked , blindfold , and a boy
 though bow and shafts and firebrand be his might
 yet ween they he can work them none annoy
 and therefore with his purple wings they play
 for glorious seemeth love though light as feather
 and when they have done they ween to scape away
 for blind men , say they , shoot they know not whither
 but when by proof they find that he did see
 and that his wound did rather dim their sight
 they wonder more how such a lad as he
 should be of such surpassing power and might
 but ants have galls , so hath the bee his sting
 then shield me , heavens , from such a subtle thing

the evening shines in may 's luxuriant pride
 and all the sunny hills at distance glow
 and all the brooks , that thro ’ the valley flow
 seem liquid gold .— o ! had my fate denied
 leisure , and power to taste the sweets that glide
 thro ’ waken 'd minds , as the soft seasons go
 on their still varying progress , for the woe
 my heart has felt , what balm had been supplied
 but where great nature smiles , as here she smiles
 ‘ mid verdant vales , and gently swelling hills
 and glassy lakes , and mazy , murmuring rills
 and narrow wood wild lanes , her spell beguiles
 th ’ impatient sighs of grief , and reconciles
 poetic minds to life , with all her ills

the castle gate stands open now
 and the wanderer is welcome to the hall
 as the hang bird is to the elm tree bough
 no longer scowl the turrets tall
 the summer 's long siege at last is o'er
 when the first poor outcast went in at the door
 she entered with him in disguise
 and mastered the fortress by surprise
 there is no spot she loves so well on ground
 she lingers and smiles there the whole year round
 the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land
 has hall and bower at his command
 and there 's no poor man in the north countree
 but is lord of the earldom as much as he

if that a loyal heart and faith unfeigned
 if a sweet languish with a chaste desire
 if hunger starven thoughts so long retained
 fed but with smoke , and cherished but with fire
 and if a brow with care 's char à cters painted
 bewray my love with broken words half spoken
 to her which sits in my thoughts ’ temple sainted
 and lays to view my vulture gnawn heart open
 if i have done due homage to her eyes
 and had my sighs still tending on her name
 if on her love my life and honour lies
 and she , th'unkindest maid , still scorns the same
 let this suffice , that all the world may see
 the fault is hers , though mine the hurt must be

good . i have done . my heart weighs . i am sad
 the outer day , void statue of lit blue
 is altogether outward , other , glad
 at mere being not i ( so my aches construe
 i , that have failed in everything , bewail
 nothing this hour but that i have bewailed
 for in the general fate what is ’ t to fail
 why , fate being past for fate , ’ tis but to have failed
 whatever hap or stop , what matters it
 sith to the mattering our will bringeth nought
 with the higher trifling let us world our wit
 conscious that , if we do ’ t , that was the lot
 the regular stars bound us to , when they stood
 godfathers to our birth and to our blood

nor the swift furie of the flames aspiring
 nor the deep wounds of victours raging blade
 nor ruthlesse spoyle of souldiers blood desiring
 the which so oft thee , rome , their conquest made
 ne stroke on stroke of fortune variable
 ne rust of age hating continuance
 nor wrath of gods , nor spight of men unstable
 nor thou oppos 'd against thine owne puissance
 nor th'horrible uprore of windes high blowing
 nor swelling streames of that god snakie paced
 which hath so often with his overflowing
 thee drenched , have thy pride so much abaced
 but that this nothing , which they have thee left
 makes the world wonder what they from thee reft

lady ! the songs of spring were in the grove
 while i was framing beds for winter flowers
 while i was planting green unfading bowers
 and shrubs to hang upon the warm alcove
 and sheltering wall ; and still , as fancy wove
 the dream , to time and nature 's blended powers
 i gave this paradise for winter hours
 a labyrinth lady ! which your feet shall rove
 yes ! when the sun of life more feebly shines
 becoming thoughts , i trust , of solemn gloom
 or of high gladness you shall hither bring
 and these perennial bowers and murmuring pines
 be gracious as the music and the bloom
 and all the mighty ravishment of spring

long dwelt his eye where these commingling pour 'd
 their waves unkeel 'd , their havens unexplored
 where frowning forests stretch the dusky wing
 and deadly damps forbid the flowers to spring
 no seasons clothe the field with cultured grain
 no buoyant ship attempts the chartless main
 then with impatient voice : my seer , he cried
 when shall my children cross the lonely tide
 here , here my sons , the hand of culture bring
 here teach the lawn to smile , the grove to sing
 ye laboring floods , no longer vainly glide
 ye harvests load them , and ye forests ride
 bear the deep burden from the joyous swain
 and tell the world where peace and plenty reign

o death , a little more , and then the worm
 a little longer , o death , a little yet
 before the grave gape and the grave worm fret
 before the sanguine spotted hand infirm
 be rottenness , and that foul brain , the germ
 of all ill things and thoughts , be stopped and set
 a little while , o death , ere he forget
 a small space more of life , a little term
 a little longer ere he and thou be met
 ere in that hand that fed thee to thy mind
 the poison cup of life be overset
 a little respite of disastrous breath
 till the soul lift up her lost eyes , and find
 nor god nor help nor hope , but thee , o death

no ! time , thou shalt not boast that i do change
 thy pyramids built up with newer might
 to me are nothing novel , nothing strange
 they are but dressings of a former sight
 our dates are brief , and therefore we admire
 what thou dost foist upon us that is old
 and rather make them born to our desire
 than think that we before have heard them told
 thy registers and thee i both defy
 not wond'ring at the present , nor the past
 for thy records , and what we see doth lie
 made more or less by thy continual haste
 this i do vow and this shall ever be
 i will be true despite thy scythe and thee

now that we 've done our best and worst , and parted
 i would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend
 ( o heart , i do not dare go empty hearted
 i 'll think of love in books , love without end
 women with child , content ; and old men sleeping
 and wet strong ploughlands , scarred for certain grain
 and babes that weep , and so forget their weeping
 and the young heavens , forgetful after rain
 and evening hush , broken by homing wings
 and song 's nobility , and wisdom holy
 that live , we dead . i would think of a thousand things
 lovely and durable , and taste them slowly
 one after one , like tasting a sweet food
 i have need to busy my heart with quietude

and the king said , “ well , we are stony broke
 but the queen could not see it was much of a joke
 and she said , “ if the metal is all used up
 pray what of the costume i want for the cup
 it all seems so dreadfully simple to me
 the stones ? why , import them from over the sea
 but a glug stood up with a mole on his chin
 and said , with a most diabolical grin
 “ your majesties , down in the country of podge
 a spy has discovered a very ‘ cute dodge
 and the ogs are determined to wage a war
 on gosh , next friday , at half past four
 then the glugs all cried , in a terrible fright
 “ how did our grandfathers manage a fight

the quene thanketh the king with al hir might
 and after this thus spak she to the knight
 whan that she saugh hir tyme , up on a day
 ‘ thou standest yet , ’ quod she , ‘ in swich array
 that of thy lyf yet hastow no suretee
 i grante thee lyf , if thou canst tellen me
 what thing is it that wommen most desyren
 be war , and keep thy nekke boon from yren
 and if thou canst nat tellen it anon
 yet wol i yeve thee leve for to gon
 a twelf month and a day , to seche and lere
 an answere suffisant in this matere
 and suretee wol i han , er that thou pace
 thy body for to yelden in this place

because thou hast the power and own'st the grace
 to look through and behind this mask of me
 ( against which , years have beat thus blanchingly
 with their rains ,) and behold my soul 's true face
 the dim and weary witness of life 's race
 because thou hast the faith and love to see
 through that same soul 's distracting lethargy
 the patient angel waiting for a place
 in the new heavens ,— because nor sin nor woe
 nor god 's infliction , nor death 's neighbourhood
 nor all which others viewing , turn to go
 nor all which makes me tired of all , self viewed
 nothing repels thee , . . . dearest , teach me so
 to pour out gratitude , as thou dost , good

forget the past and live the present hour
 now is the time to work , the time to fill
 the soul with noblest thoughts , the time to will
 heroic deeds , to use whatever dower
 heaven has bestowed , to test our utmost power
 now is the time to live , and , better still
 to serve our loved ones ; over passing ill
 to rise triumphant ; thus the perfect flower
 of life shall come to fruitage ; wealth amass
 for grandest giving ere the time be gone
 be glad to day — to morrow may bring tears
 be brave to day ; the darkest night will pass
 and golden days will usher in the dawn
 who conquers now shall rule the coming years

“ an upstart multitude and sudden gains
 pride and excess , o florence ! have in thee
 engender 'd , so that now in tears thou mourn'st
 thus cried i with my face uprais 'd , and they
 all three , who for an answer took my words
 look 'd at each other , as men look when truth
 comes to their ear . “ if thou at other times
 they all at once rejoin 'd , “ so easily
 satisfy those , who question , happy thou
 gifted with words , so apt to speak thy thought
 wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime
 returning to behold the radiant stars
 when thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past
 see that of us thou speak among mankind

no more their snowy flocks shall shepherds lead
 by babel 's silver stream and fertile mead
 or peasant girls at summer 's eve repair
 to wreathe with wilding flowers their flowing hair
 or pour their plaintive ditties to the wave
 that rolls its sullen murmurs o'er thy grave
 the wandering arab there no rest shall find
 but , starting , listen to the hollow wind
 that howls , prophetic , through thy ruined halls
 and flee in haste from thy accursed walls
 oh babylon , with wrath encompassed round
 for thee no hope , no mercy , shall be found
 thy doom is sealed — e'en to thy ruin clings
 the awful sentence of the king of kings

meantime the lofty rooms the prince surveys
 where lay the treasures of the ithacian race
 here ruddy brass and gold refulgent blazed
 there polished chests embroider 'd vestures graced

years , months , days , hours , in sighs i sadly spend
 i black the night wherein i sleepless toss
 i love my griefs yet wish them at an end
 thus time 's expense increaseth but my loss
 i musing stand and wonder at my love
 that in so fair should be a heart of steel
 and then i think my fancy to remove
 but then more painful i my passions feel
 thus must i love , sweet fair , until i die
 and your unkindness doth my love increase
 i conquered am , i can it not deny
 my life must end , yet shall my love not cease
 then heavens , make licia fair most kind to me
 or with my life my loss may finished be

the famous warriors of the anticke world

 in which they would the records have enrold
 of theyr great deeds and valorous emprize
 what trophee then shall i most fit devize
 in which i may record the memory
 of my loves conquest , peerlesse beauties prise
 adorn 'd with honour , love , and chastity
 even this verse , vowd to eternity
 shall be thereof immortall moniment
 and tell her praise to all posterity

 gotten at last with labour and long toyle

soone after this i saw an elephant
 adorn 'd with bells and bosses gorgeouslie
 that on his backe did beare , as batteilant
 a gilden towre , which shone exceedinglie
 that he himselfe through foolish vanitie
 both for his rich attire and goodly forme
 was puffed up with passing surquedrie
 and shortly gan all other beasts to scorne
 till that a little ant , a silly worme
 into his nosthrils creeping , so him pained
 that , casting downe his towres , he did deforme
 both borrowed pride , and native beautie stained
 let therefore nought that great is therein glorie
 sith so small thing his happines may varie

i met a traveller from an antique land
 who said : two vast and trunkless legs of stone
 stand in the desert ... near them , on the sand
 half sunk , a shattered visage lies , whose frown
 and wrinkled lip , and sneer of cold command
 tell that its sculptor well those passions read
 which yet survive , stamped on these lifeless things
 the hand that mocked them , and the heart that fed
 and on the pedestal these words appear
 ‘ my name is ozymandias , king of kings
 look on my works , ye mighty , and despair
 nothing beside remains . round the decay
 of that colossal wreck , boundless and bare
 the lone and level sands stretch far away

the world was in its day of peril dark
 wont to believe the dotage of fond love
 from the fair cyprian deity , who rolls
 in her third epicycle , shed on men
 by stream of potent radiance : therefore they
 of elder time , in their old error blind
 not her alone with sacrifice ador 'd
 and invocation , but like honours paid
 to cupid and dione , deem 'd of them
 her mother , and her son , him whom they feign 'd
 to sit in dido 's bosom : and from her
 whom i have sung preluding , borrow 'd they
 the appellation of that star , which views
 now obvious and now averse , the sun

howe'er this fair , amid adventures dire
 more sufferings shared than malice could desire
 though eight times , doubtless , she exchanged her knight
 no proof , that she her spouse was led to slight
 ‘ twas gratitude , compassion , or good will
 the dread of worse ;— she 'd truly had her fill
 excuses just , to vindicate her fame
 who , spite of troubles , fanned the monarch 's flame
 of eight the relict , still a maid received
 apparently , the prince her pure believed
 for , though at times we may be duped in this
 yet , after such a number — strange to miss
 and i submit to those who 've passed the scene
 if they , to my opinion , do not lean

first time he kissed me , he but only kissed
 the fingers of this hand wherewith i write
 and ever since , it grew more clean and white
 slow to world greetings , quick with its “ o , list
 when the angels speak . a ring of amethyst
 i could not wear here , plainer to my sight
 than that first kiss . the second passed in height
 the first , and sought the forehead , and half missed
 half falling on the hair . o beyond meed
 that was the chrism of love , which love 's own crown
 with sanctifying sweetness , did precede
 the third upon my lips was folded down
 in perfect , purple state ; since when , indeed
 i have been proud and said , “ my love , my own

this dreadful combat great epeus chose
 high o ’ er the crowd , enormous bulk ! he rose
 and seized the beast , and thus began to say
 “ stand forth some man , to bear the bowl away
 ( price of his ruin : for who dares deny
 this mule my right ; the undoubted victor i

 but the first honours of this fight are mine
 for who excels in all ? then let my foe
 draw near , but first his certain fortune know

with that the chief the tender victims slew
 and in the dust their bleeding bodies threw
 the vital spirit issued at the wound
 and left the members quivering on the ground
 from the same urn they drink the mingled wine
 and add libations to the powers divine
 while thus their prayers united mount the sky
 “ hear , mighty jove ! and hear , ye gods on high
 and may their blood , who first the league confound
 shed like this wine , disdain the thirsty ground
 may all their consorts serve promiscuous lust
 and all their lust be scatter ’ d as the dust
 thus either host their imprecations join ’ d
 which jove refused , and mingled with the wind

the palmer bent , with locks of silver gray
 quits the sweet spot where he has pass 'd his years
 quits his poor family , whose anxious fears
 paint the loved father fainting on his way
 and trembling , on his aged limbs slow borne
 in these last days that close his earthly course
 he , in his soul 's strong purpose , finds new force
 though weak with age , though by long travel worn
 thus reaching rome , led on by pious love
 he seeks the image of that saviour lord
 whom soon he hopes to meet in bliss above
 so , oft in other forms i seek to trace
 some charm , that to my heart may yet afford
 a faint resemblance of thy matchless grace

great hearted brother to the wilderness
 comrade of wind and sea ! interpreter
 of nomad nature ! ere the quick'ning stir
 of spring sap thrills the wood from sullen stress
 of winter 's spell — away from throng è d press
 of urban ways thy wild feet wander far
 tracking the steps of some white northern star
 whose rays are beacon to thy restlessness
 weird mystic of the northland 's mystery
 thou ‘ front'st the unseen shadow , nor dost fear
 to meet the scarlet hunter on the trail
 pagan as pan ; to all things sylvan dear
 nature 's own vagrant , buoyant , driftless , free
 all winds and woods and waters cry thee hail

the hills more glorious in their coat of snow
 rise all around him , in the valleys run
 bright streams , and there are lakes that catch the sun
 and sunlit fields of emerald far below
 that seem alive with inward light . in smoke
 the far horizons fade ; and there is peace
 on everything , a sense of blessed release
 from wilful strife . like some prophetic cloak
 the spirit of the mountains has descended
 on all the world , and its unrest is ended
 even the sea , glimpsed far away , seems still
 hushed to a silver peace its storm and strife
 mountains of vision , calm above fate and will
 you hold the promise of the freer life

sometimes we feel so spent for want of rest
 we have no thought beyond . i know to day
 when tired of bitter lips and dull delay
 with faithless words , i cast mine eyes upon
 the shadows of a distant mountain crest
 and said “ that hill must hide within its breast
 some secret glen secluded from the sun
 oh , mother nature ! would that i could run
 outside to thee ; and , like a wearied guest
 half blind with lamps , and sick of feasting , lay
 an aching head on thee . then down the streams
 the moon might swim , and i should feel her grace
 while soft winds blew the sorrows from my face
 so quiet in the fellowship of dreams

england , i stand on thy imperial ground
 not all a stranger ; as thy bugles blow
 i feel within my blood old battles flow
 the blood whose ancient founts in thee are found
 still surging dark against the christian bound
 wide islam presses ; well its peoples know
 thy heights that watch them wandering below
 i think how lucknow heard their gathering sound
 i turn , and meet the cruel , turbaned face
 england , ‘ t is sweet to be so much thy son
 i feel the conqueror in my blood and race
 last night trafalgar awed me , and to day
 gibraltar wakened ; hark , thy evening gun
 startles the desert over africa

sheath 'd is the river as it glideth by
 frost pearl 'd are all the boughs of forests old
 the sheep are huddling close upon the wold
 and over them the stars tremble on high
 pure joys these winter nights around me lie
 ‘ tis fine to loiter through the lighted streets
 at christmas time , and guess from brow and pace
 the doom and history of each one we meet
 what kind of heart beats in each dusky case
 whiles , startled by the beauty of a face
 in a shop light a moment . or instead
 to dream of silent fields where calm and deep
 the sunshine lieth like a golden sleep
 recalling sweetest looks of summers dead

into the golden vessel of great song
 let us pour all our passion ; breast to breast
 let other lovers lie , in love and rest
 not we ,— articulate , so , but with the tongue
 of all the world : the churning blood , the long
 shuddering quiet , the desperate hot palms pressed
 sharply together upon the escaping guest
 the common soul , unguarded , and grown strong
 longing alone is singer to the lute
 let still on nettles in the open sigh
 the minstrel , that in slumber is as mute
 as any man , and love be far and high
 that else forsakes the topmost branch , a fruit
 found on the ground by every passer by

now , now i love indeed , and suffer more
 in one day now then i did in a year
 great flames they be which but small sparkles were
 and wounded now , i was but pricked before
 no marvel then , though more than heretofore
 i weep and sigh ; how can great wounds be there
 where moisture runs not out ? and ever , where
 the fire is great , of smoke there must be store
 my heart was hitherto but like green wood
 which must be dried before it will burn bright
 my former love served but my heart to dry
 now cupid for his fire doth find it good
 for now it burneth clear , and shall give light
 for all the world your beauty to espy

like a bad suitor desperate and trembling
 from the mixed sense of being not loved and loving
 who with feared longing half would know , dissembling
 with what he ’ d wish proved what he fears soon proving
 i look with inner eyes afraid to look
 yet perplexed into looking , at the worth
 this verse may have and wonder , of my book
 to what thoughts shall ’ t in alien hearts give birth
 but , as he who doth love , and , loving , hopes
 yet , hoping , fears , fears to put proof to proof
 and in his mind for possible proofs gropes
 delaying the true proof , lest the real thing scoff
 i daily live , i ’ th ’ fame i dream to see
 but by my thought of others ’ thought of me

and while he won the world for her domain
 her loins brought forth , her fostering bosom fed
 souls that have swept the spiritual seas
 from heaven to hell , and justified her crown
 for round the throne of great elizabeth
 spenser and burleigh , sidney and verulam
 clustered like stars , rare jonson like the crown
 of cassiopeia , marlowe ruddy as mars
 and over all those mighty hearts arose
 the soul of shakespeare brooding far and wide
 beyond our small horizons , like a light
 thrown from a vaster sun that still illumes
 tracts which the arc of our increasing day
 must still leave undiscovered , unexplored

therefore i trust , although to outward sense
 both true and false seem shaken ; i will hold
 with newer light my reverence for the old
 and calmly wait the births of providence
 no gain is lost ; the clear eyed saints look down
 untroubled on the wreck of schemes and creeds
 love yet remains , its rosary of good deeds
 counting in task field and o'erpeopled town
 truth has charmed life ; the inward word survives
 and , day by day , its revelation brings
 faith , hope , and charity , whatsoever things
 which cannot be shaken , stand . still holy lives
 reveal the christ of whom the letter told
 and the new gospel verifies the old

to thee , dear god of mercy , both appeal
 who straightway sound the call to arms . thou know'st
 and that black spot in each embattled host
 spring of the blood stream , later wilt reveal
 now is it red artillery and white steel
 till on a day will ring the victor 's boast
 that ‘ tis thy chosen towers uppermost
 where thy rejected grovels under heel
 so in all times of man 's descent insane
 to brute , did strength and craft combining strike
 even as a god of armies , his fell blow
 but at the close he entered thy domain
 dear god of mercy , and if lion like
 he tore the fall'n , the eternal was his foe

soon as glumdalclitch miss 'd her pleasing care
 she wept , she blubber 'd , and she tore her hair
 no british miss sincerer grief has known
 her squirrel missing , or her sparrow flown
 she furl 'd her sampler , and haul 'd in her thread
 and stuck her needle into grildrig 's bed
 then spread her hands , and with a bounce let fall
 her baby , like the giant in guildhall
 in peals of thunder now she roars , and now
 she gently whimpers like a lowing cow
 yet lovely in her sorrow still appears
 her locks dishevell 'd , and her flood of tears
 seem like the lofty barn of some rich swain
 when from the thatch drips fast a shower of rain

when i remember them , those friends of mine
 who are no longer here , the noble three
 who half my life were more than friends to me
 and whose discourse was like a generous wine
 i most of all remember the divine
 something , that shone in them , and made us see
 the archetypal man , and what might be
 the amplitude of nature 's first design
 in vain i stretch my hands to clasp their hands
 i cannot find them . nothing now is left
 but a majestic memory . they meanwhile
 wander together in elysian lands
 perchance remembering me , who am bereft
 of their dear presence , and , remembering , smile

to thee that art the sommers nightingale
 thy soveraigne goddesses most deare delight
 why doe i send this rustick madrigale
 that may thy tunefull eare unseason quite
 thou onely fit this argument to write
 in whose high thoughts pleasure hath built her bowre
 and dainty love learnd sweetly to endite
 my rimes i know unsavory and sowre
 to taste the streames , that , like a golden showre
 flow from thy fruitfull head , of thy loves praise
 fitter perhaps to thunder martiall stowre
 when so thee list thy loftie muse to raise
 yet , till that thou thy poeme wilt make knowne
 let thy faire cinthias praises be thus rudely showne

the rooks aclamor when one enters here
 startle the empty towers far overhead
 through gaping walls the summer fields appear
 green , tan , or , poppy mingled , tinged with red
 the courts where revel rang deep grass and moss
 cover , and tangled vines have overgrown
 the gate where banners blazoned with a cross
 rolled forth to toss round tyre and ascalon
 decay consumes it . the old causes fade
 and fretting for the contest many a heart
 waits their tyrtaeus to chant on the new
 oh , pass him by who , in this haunted shade
 musing enthralled , has only this much art
 to love the things the birds and flowers love too

at times i am the mother of the world
 and mine seem all its sorrows , and its fears
 that rose , which in each mother heart is curled
 the rose of pity , opens with my tears
 and , waking in the night , i lie and hark
 to the lone sobbing , and the wild alarms
 of my world child , a wailing in the dark
 the child i fain would shelter in my arms
 i call to it ( as from another room
 a mother calls , what time she cannot go
 ‘ sleep well , dear world ; love hides behind this gloom
 there is no need for wakefulness or woe
 the long , long night is almost past and gone
 the day is near . ’ and yet the world weeps on

here lie the peril and necessity
 that need a race of giants — a great realm
 with not one noble leader at the helm
 and the great ship of state still driving high
 ‘ midst breakers , on a lee shore — to the rocks
 with ever and anon most terrible shocks
 the crew aghast , and fear in every eye
 yet is the gracious providence still nigh
 and , if our cause be just , our hearts be true
 we shall save goodly ship and gallant crew
 nor suffer shipwreck of our liberty
 it needs that as a people we arise
 with solemn purpose that even fate defies
 and brave all perils with unblenching eye

this pan is but an idle god , i guess
 since all the fair midsummer of my dreams
 he loiters listlessly by woody streams
 soaking the lush glooms up with laziness
 or drowsing while the maiden winds caress
 him prankishly , and powder him with gleams
 of sifted sunshine . and he ever seems
 drugged with a joy unutterable — unless
 his low pipes whistle hints of it far out
 across the ripples to the dragon fly
 that like a wind born blossom blown about
 drops quiveringly down , as though to die
 then lifts and wavers on , as if in doubt
 whether to fan his wings or fly without

with clytia he no longer was received 
 than while he was a man of wealth believed 
 balls , concerts , op'ras , tournaments , and plays 
 expensive dresses , all engaging ways 
 were used to captivate this lady fair 
 while scarcely one around but in despair 
 wife , widow , maid , his fond affection sought 
 to gain him , ev'ry wily art was brought 
 but all in vain :— by passion overpow'red 
 the belle , whose conduct others would have soured 
 to him appeared a goddess full of charms 
 superior e'en to helen , in his arms 
 from whence we may conclude , the beauteous dame 
 was always deaf to fred'rick ' s ardent flame 

our love is not a fading earthly flower 
 its wing è d seed dropped down from paradise 
 and , nursed by day and night , by sun and shower 
 doth momently to fresher beauty rise 
 to us the leafless autumn is not bare 
 nor winter 's rattling boughs lack lusty green 
 our summer hearts make summer 's fullness where 
 no leaf or bud or blossom may be seen 
 for nature 's life in love 's deep life doth lie 
 love ,— whose forgetfulness is beauty 's death 
 whose mystic key these cells of thou and i 
 into the infinite freedom openeth 
 and makes the body 's dark and narrow grate 
 the wide flung leaves of heaven 's palace gate 

say thou , his will be done who is the good 
 his will be borne who knoweth how to bear 
 who also in the night had need of prayer 
 both when awoke divinely longing mood 
 and when the power of darkness him withstood 
 for what is coming take no jot of care 
 behind , before , around thee as the air 
 he o'er thee like thy mother 's heart will brood 
 and when thou hast wearied thy wings of prayer 
 then fold them , and drop gently to thy nest 
 which is thy faith ; and make thy people blest 
 with what thou bring'st from that ethereal height 
 which whoso looks on thee will straightway share 
 he needs no eyes who is a shining light 

the spirit of enjoyment and desire 
 and hopes and wishes , from all living things 
 went circling , like a multitude of sounds 
 the budding groves appear 'd as if in haste 
 to spur the steps of june ; as if their shades 
 of various green were hindrances that stood 
 between them and their object : yet , meanwhile 
 there was such deep contentment in the air 
 that every naked ash , and tardy tree 
 yet leafless , seem 'd as though the countenance 
 with which it look 'd on this delightful day 
 were native to the summer .— up the brook 
 i roam 'd in the confusion of my heart 
 alive to all things and forgetting all 

and yet i cannot reprehend the flight 
 or blame th'attempt , presuming so to soar 
 the mounting venture for a high delight 
 did make the honour of the fall the more 
 for who gets wealth , that puts not from the shore 
 danger hath honours , great designs their fame 
 glory doth follow , courage goes before 
 and though th'event oft answers not the same 
 suffice that high attempts have never shame 
 the mean observer whom base safety keeps 
 lives without honour , dies without a name 
 and in eternal darkness ever sleeps 
 and therefore , delia , ‘ tis to me no blot 
 to have attempted though attained thee not 

my grief begun , fair saint , when first i saw 
 love in those eyes sit ruling with disdain 
 whose sweet commands did keep a world in awe 
 and caused them serve your favor to obtain 
 i stood as one enchanted with a frown 
 yet smiled to see all creatures serve those eyes 
 where each with sighs paid tribute to that crown 
 and thought them grac è d by your dumb replies 
 but i , ambitious , could not be content 
 till that my service more than sighs made known 
 and for that end my heart to you i sent 
 to say and swear that , fair , it is your own 
 then greater graces , licia , do impart 
 not dumb replies unto a speaking heart 

we soon approach 'd it . o thou lombard spirit 
 how didst thou stand , in high abstracted mood 
 scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes 
 it spoke not aught , but let us onward pass 
 eyeing us as a lion on his watch 
 but virgil with entreaty mild advanc 'd 
 requesting it to show the best ascent 
 it answer to his question none return 'd 
 but of our country and our kind of life 
 demanded . when my courteous guide began 
 “ mantua , ” the solitary shadow quick 
 rose towards us from the place in which it stood 
 and cry 'd , “ mantuan ! i am thy countryman 
 sordello . ” each the other then embrac 'd 

i meet not mine by others ’ discontent 
 for none compares with me in true devotion 
 yet though my tears and sighs to her be spent 
 her cruel heart disdains what they do motion 
 yet though persisting in eternal hate 
 to aggravate the cause of my complaining 
 her fury ne'er confineth with a date 
 i will not cease to love , for her disdaining 
 such puny thoughts of unresolv è d ground 
 whose inaudacity dares but base conceit 
 in me and my love never shall be found 
 those coward thoughts unworthy minds await 
 but those that love well have not yet begun 
 pers è ver ever and have never done 

but hark ! the doors on jarring hinges turn 
 all enter in , and the blest scene 's begun 
 a thousand lights their livid flames display 
 pour forth their blaze , and form a mimick day 
 sudden a motley mixture fills the place 
 and footmen shine as lordly as his grace 
 to see the sad effect and power of change 
 ladies turn 'd men , in breeches freely range 
 young smooth chin 'd beaux turn priests and fryars 
 and nun 's chaste habits hide our country ‘ squires 
 belles , beaux , and sharpers here together play 
 and wives throw their good spouses wealth away 
 and when their cash runs low , and fate runs cross 
 they then cornute ‘ em to retrieve their loss 

“ i 'll come to that in time , if you 'll be still 
 well , so the bishop left , and in six weeks 
 or somewhere there , i started for montreaux 
 to meet the bishop . shipped ahead my trunk 
 to jaffa as the bishop did . but now 
 i must tell you my dream . the night before 
 i reached montreaux i had a wondrous dream 
 i saw the bishop on the station platform 
 his face with brandy blossoms splotched and wearing 
 his gold head cane . and sure enough next day 
 as i stepped from the train i saw the bishop 
 his face with brandy blossoms splotched and wearing 
 his gold head cane . and i thought something wrong 
 and still i did n't act upon the thought 

is that a swan that rides upon the water 
 oh no , it is that other gentle bird 
 which is the patron of our noble calling 
 i well remember , in my early years 
 when these young hands first closed upon a goose 
 i have a scar upon my thimble finger 
 which chronicles the hour of young ambition 
 my father was a tailor , and his father 
 and my sire 's grandsire , all of them were tailors 
 they had an ancient goose ,— it was an heirloom 
 from some remoter tailor of our race 
 it happened i did see it on a time 
 when none was near , and i did deal with it 
 and it did burn me ,— oh , most fearfully 

great ajax telamon first hyrtius smote 
 the son of gyrtius , who to battle led 
 the warlike mysians ; next antilochus 
 from mermerus and phalces stripp 'd their arms 
 meriones hippotion gave to death 
 and morys ; teucer periphetes slew 
 and prothoon ; menelaus , through the flank 
 smote hyperenor ; as the grinding spear 
 drain 'd all his vitals , through the gaping wound 
 his spirit escap 'd , and darkness clos 'd his eyes 
 but chiefest slaughter of the trojans wrought 
 oileus ’ active son ; of all the greeks 
 no foot so swift as his , when jove had fill 'd 
 their souls with fear , to chase the flying foe 

italia ! thou art fallen , though with sheen 
 of battle spears thy clamorous armies stride 
 from the north alps to the sicilian tide 
 ay ! fallen , though the nations hail thee queen 
 because rich gold in every town is seen 
 and on thy sapphire lake in tossing pride 
 of wind filled vans thy myriad galleys ride 
 beneath one flag of red and white and green 
 o fair and strong ! o strong and fair in vain 
 look southward where rome 's desecrated town 
 lies mourning for her god anointed king 
 look heaven ward ! shall god allow this thing 
 nay ! but some flame girt raphael shall come down 
 and smite the spoiler with the sword of pain 

“ the barley harvest was nodding white 
 when my children died on the rocky height 
 and the reapers were singing on hill and plain 
 when i came to my task of sorrow and pain 
 but now the season of rain is nigh 
 the sun is dim in the thickening sky 
 and the clouds in sullen darkness rest 
 where he hides his light at the doors of the west 
 i hear the howl of the wind that brings 
 the long drear storm on its heavy wings 
 but the howling wind and the driving rain 
 will beat on my houseless head in vain 
 i shall stay , from my murdered sons to scare 
 the beasts of the desert , and fowls of air 

where dim the ethereal eye , no art , though clear 
 as golden star in morning 's amber springs 
 can pierce the fogs of low imaginings 
 painting and sculpture are a mockery mere 
 where dull to deafness is the hearing ear 
 vain is the poet . nought but earthly things 
 have credence . when the soaring skylark sings 
 how shall the stony statue strain to hear 
 open the deaf ear , wake the sleeping eye 
 and lo , musicians , painters , poets — all 
 trooping instinctive , come without a call 
 as winds that where they list blow evermore 
 as waves from silent deserts roll to die 
 in mighty voices on the peopled shore 

about a mile behind the viny banks 
 how sweet it was , upon a sloping green 
 sunspread , and shaded with a branching screen 
 to lie in peace half murmuring words of thanks 
 to see the mountains on each other climb 
 with spaces for rich meadows flowery bright 
 the winding river freshening the sight 
 at intervals , the trees in leafy prime 
 the distant village roofs of blue and white 
 with intersections of quaint fashioned beams 
 all slanting crosswise , and the feudal gleams 
 of ruined turrets , barren in the light 
 to watch the changing clouds , like clime in clime 
 oh sweet to lie and bless the luxury of time 

the knave of diamonds tries his wily arts 
 and wins ( oh shameful chance !) the queen of hearts 
 at this , the blood the virgin 's cheek forsook 
 a livid paleness spreads o'er all her look 
 she sees , and trembles at th ’ approaching ill 
 just in the jaws of ruin , and codille 
 and now ( as oft in some distempered state 
 on one nice trick depends the general fate 
 an ace of hearts steps forth : the king unseen 
 lurked in her hand , and mourned his captive queen 
 he springs to vengeance with an eager pace 
 and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace 
 the nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky 
 the walls , the woods , and long canals reply 

whoever thinks a faultless piece to see 
 thinks what ne'er was , nor is , nor e'er shall be 
 in every work regard the writer 's end 
 since none can compass more than they intend 
 and if the means be just , the conduct true 
 applause , in spite of trivial faults , is due 
 as men of breeding , sometimes men of wit 
 to avoid great errors , must the less commit 
 neglect the rules each verbal critic lays 
 for not to know some trifles is a praise 
 most critics , fond of some subservient art 
 still make the whole depend upon a part 
 they talk of principles , but notions prize 
 and all to one loved folly sacrifice 

lo , the poor indian ! whose untutor 'd mind 
 sees god in clouds , or hears him in the wind 
 his soul , proud science never taught to stray 
 far as the solar walk , or milky way 
 yet simple nature to his hope has given 
 behind the cloud topp 'd hill , an humbler heaven 
 some safer world in depth of woods embraced 
 some happier island in the watery waste 
 where slaves once more their native land behold 
 no fiends torment , no christians thirst for gold 
 to be , contents his natural desire 
 he asks no angel 's wing , no seraph 's fire 
 but thinks , admitted to that equal sky 
 his faithful dog shall bear him company 

sir , if my unpolish't pen , that dedicates new 
 the bashfull utterance of a maiden muse 
 may gracefully arrive onely to you 
 which for her virgin sake , do not refuse 
 time , and more studious howers shall we vow 
 to sing your vertues , which are now profuse 
 kings haue drunke water from a louing hand 
 and truth 's accepted , though we paint her poore 
 the poets say , the gods that can command 
 haue feasted gladly on a poore mans store 
 whereby great sir , we haue to understand 
 that humble riuers adde to the seashore 
 liue long and happy , and with gray haires crown 'd 
 reade thy youths acts , which fame shall euer sound 

as sheep , that step from forth their fold , by one 
 or pairs , or three at once ; meanwhile the rest 
 stand fearfully , bending the eye and nose 
 to ground , and what the foremost does , that do 
 the others , gath'ring round her , if she stops 
 simple and quiet , nor the cause discern 
 so saw i moving to advance the first 
 who of that fortunate crew were at the head 
 of modest mien and graceful in their gait 
 when they before me had beheld the light 
 from my right side fall broken on the ground 
 so that the shadow reach 'd the cave , they stopp 'd 
 and somewhat back retir 'd : the same did all 
 who follow 'd , though unweeting of the cause 

here paused the witch to mend her glowing fire 
 while each man to his neighbour shuffled nigher 
 as witch flame leapt and ever brighter grew 
 till , to their horror , sudden it burned blue 
 whereat each silent , fearful beholder 
 felt in the gloom to touch his fellow 's shoulder 
 yet , in that moment , knew an added dread 
 to see the fire from blue turn ghastly red 
 then , as the witch did o'er it crooning lean 
 behold ! it changed again to baleful green 
 whereat the witch flung bony arms on high 
 as though with claw like hands she ‘ d rend the sky 
 and while the lurid flames leapt ever higher 
 she thus invoked the spirit of the fire 

when i consider how my light is spent 
 ere half my days , in this dark world and wide 
 and that one talent which is death to hide 
 lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent 
 to serve therewith my maker , and present 
 my true account , lest he , returning , chide 
 “ doth god exact day labor , light denied 
 i fondly ask . but patience , to prevent 
 that murmur , soon replies , “ god doth not need 
 either man 's work or his own gifts . who best 
 bear his mild yoke , they serve him best . his state 
 is kingly : thousands at his bidding speed 
 and post o'er land and ocean without rest 
 they also serve who only stand and wait 

the spark concealed himself ; each charm admired 
 now this , now that , now t'other feature fired 
 a hundred beauties caught his eager sight 
 and while his bosom felt supreme delight 
 he turned his thoughts advantages to take 
 and of the maiden 's error something make 
 assumed the character , and dress ; and air 
 that should a wat'ry deity declare 
 within the gliding flood his vestments dipt 
 a crown of rushes on his head he slipt 
 aquatick herbs and plants around he twined 
 then mercury intreated to be kind 
 and cupid too , the wily god of hearts 
 how could the innocent resist these arts 

honora , shou 'd that cruel time arrive 
 when ‘ gainst my truth thou should'st my errors poize 
 scorning remembrance of our vanish 'd joys 
 when for the love warm looks , in which i live 
 but cold respect must greet me , that shall give 
 no tender glance , no kind regretful sighs 
 when thou shalt pass me with averted eyes 
 feigning thou see'st me not , to sting , and grieve 
 and sicken my sad heart , i cou 'd not bear 
 such dire eclipse of thy soul cheering rays 
 i cou 'd not learn my struggling heart to tear 
 from thy lov 'd form , that thro ’ my memory strays 
 nor in the pale horizon of despair 
 endure the wintry and the darken 'd days 

hark you such sound as quivers ? kings will hear 
 as kings have heard , and tremble on their thrones 
 the old will feel the weight of mossy stones 
 the young alone will laugh and scoff at fear 
 it is the tread of armies marching near 
 from scarlet lands to lands forever pale 
 it is a bugle dying down the gale 
 it is the sudden gushing of a tear 
 and it is hands that grope at ghostly doors 
 and romp of spirit children on the pave 
 it is the tender sighing of the brave 
 who fell , ah ! long ago , in futile wars 
 it is such sound as death ; and , after all 
 ‘ tis but the forest letting dead leaves fall 

xiv . as the pent torrent in uneasy rest 
 under the griping rocks , doth ever keep 
 a monstrous working as it lies asleep 
 in the round hollow of some mountain 's breast 
 till where it hideth in its sweltering nest 
 some earthquake finds it , and its waters leap 
 forth to the sunshine down the mighty steep 
 so in thee once was anguished forth the quest 
 whereby man sought for life power as he lay 
 under his own proud heart and black despair 
 wedged fast and stifled up with loads of care 
 yet at dumb struggle with the tyrant clay 
 thou wentest down below the roots of prayer 
 and he hath cried aloud since that same day 

but who , half sceptic , half afraid of wrong 
 shall walk our streets , and mark the passing throng 
 the brawny oaf in mould herculean cast 
 the pigmy statesman trembling in his blast 
 the cumb'rous citizen of portly paunch 
 unwont to soar beyond the smoaking haunch 
 the meagre bard behind the moving tun 
 his shadow seeming lengthen 'd by the sun 
 who forms scarce visible shall thus descry 
 like flitting clouds athwart the mental sky 
 from giant bodies then bare gleams of mind 
 like mountain watch lights blinking to the wind 
 nor blush to find his unperverted eye 
 flash on his heart , and give his tongue the lie 

three men lived yet when this dead man was young 
 whose names and words endure for ever : one 
 whose eyes grew dim with straining toward the sun 
 and his wings weakened , and his angel 's tongue 
 lost half the sweetest song was ever sung 
 but like the strain half uttered earth hears none 
 nor shall man hear till all men 's songs are done 
 one whose clear spirit like an eagle hung 
 between the mountains hallowed by his love 
 and the sky stainless as his soul above 
 and one the sweetest heart that ever spake 
 the brightest words wherein sweet wisdom smiled 
 these deathless names by this dead snake defiled 
 bid memory spit upon him for their sake 

far out of bounds he 's figured — in a race 
 of west end traffic pitching to his loss 
 but if you 'd see him in his proper place 
 making the browns for bub and grub and doss 
 go east among the merchants and their men 
 and where the press is noisiest , and the tides 
 of trade run highest and widest , there and then 
 you shall behold him , edging with equal strides 
 along the kerb ; hawking in either hand 
 some artful nothing made of twine and tin 
 cardboard and foil and bits of rubber band 
 some penn'orth of wit in fact that , with a grin 
 the careful city marvels at , and buys 
 for nurselings in the suburbs to despise 

o lords our gods , it is not that ye sit 
 serene above the thunder , and exempt 
 from strife of tongues and casualties that tempt 
 men merely found by proof of manhood fit 
 for service of their fellows : this is it 
 which sets you past the reach of time 's attempt 
 which gives us right of justified contempt 
 for commonwealths built up by mere men 's wit 
 that gold unlocks not , nor may flatteries ope 
 the portals of your heaven ; that none may hope 
 with you to watch how life beneath you plods 
 save for high service given , high duty done 
 that never was your rank ignobly won 
 for this we give you praise , o lords our gods 

throughout the country nothing now was heard 
 save talk of civil war ; yet undeterred 
 was he , by what was going on around 
 from his employment ; and kept gaining ground 
 the village of brave soldier 's was quite full 
 and they , alone , made business far from dull 
 when he at first commended , he made a rule 
 for which some folks then deemed him quite a fool 
 to make good work and cheap , and have his pay 
 for all he sold ; and this he did always 
 he had been taught to look honesty 
 as the best part of business policy 
 and his experience fully proved the truth 
 of that old maxim learned in early youth 

i must not think of thee ; and , tired yet strong 
 i shun the thought that lurks in all delight 
 the thought of thee — and in the blue heaven 's height 
 and in the dearest passage of a song 
 oh , just beyond the fairest thoughts that throng 
 this breast the thought of thee waits , hidden yet bright 
 but it must never , never come in sight 
 i must stop short of thee the whole day long 
 but when sleep comes to close each difficult day 
 when night gives pause to the long watch i keep 
 and all my bonds i needs must loose apart 
 must doff my will as raiment laid away 
 with the first dream that comes with the first sleep 
 i run , i run , i am gathered to thy heart 

“ hear me , ye countless tribes , that dwelling round 
 assist our cause ! you from your sev'ral homes 
 not for display of numbers have i call 'd 
 but that with willing hearts ye should defend 
 our wives and infants from the warlike greeks 
 for this i drain my people 's stores , for food 
 and gifts for you , exalting your estate 
 then , who will boldly onward , he may fall 
 or safe escape , such is the chance of war 
 but who within our valiant trojans ’ ranks 
 shall but the body of patroclus bring 
 despite the might of ajax ; half the spoils 
 to him i give , the other half myself 
 retaining ; and his praise shall equal mine 

maids shout to breakfast in a merry strife 
 and the cat runs to hear the whetted knife 
 and dogs are ever in the way to watch 
 the mouldy crust and falling bone to catch 
 the wooden dishes round in haste are set 
 and round the table all the boys are met 
 all know their own save hodge who would be first 
 but every one his master leaves the worst 
 on every wooden dish , a humble claim 
 two rude cut letters mark the owner 's name 
 from every nook the smile of plenty calls 
 and rusty flitches decorate the walls 
 moore 's almanack where wonders never cease 
 all smeared with candle snuff and bacon grease 

the social laws from insult to protect 
 to cherish peace , to cultivate respect 
 the rich from wanton cruelty restrain 
 to smooth the bed of penury and pain 
 the hapless vagrant to his rest restore 
 the maze of fraud , the haunts of theft explore 
 the thoughtless maiden , when subdued by art 
 to aid , and bring her rover to her heart 
 wild riot 's voice with dignity to quell 
 forbid unpeaceful passions to rebel 
 wrest from revenge the meditated harm 
 for this fair justice raised her sacred arm 
 for this the rural magistrate , of yore 
 thy honours , edward , to his mansion bore 

take down thy stars , o god ! we look not up 
 in vain thou hangest there thy changeless sign 
 we lift our eyes to power 's glowing cup 
 nor care if blood make strong that wizard wine 
 so we but drink and feel the sorcery 
 of conquest in our veins , of wits grown keen 
 in strain and strife for flesh sweet sovereignty 
 the fatal thrill of kingship over men 
 what though the soul be from the body shrunk 
 and we array the temple , but no god 
 what though , the cup of golden greed once drunk 
 our dust be laid in a dishonoured sod 
 while thy loud hosts proclaim the end of wars 
 we read no sign . o god , take down thy stars 

yet , ‘ midst the blaze of courts , she fix 'd her love 
 on the cool fountain , or the shady grove 
 still , with the shepherd 's innocence , her mind 
 to the sweet vale , and flowery mead , inclined 
 and oft as spring renew 'd the plains with flowers 
 breathed his soft gales , and led the fragrant hours 
 with sure return she sought the sylvan scene 
 the breezy mountains , and the forests green 
 her maids around her moved , a duteous band 
 each bore a crook , all rural , in her hand 
 some simple lay , of flocks and herds , they sung 
 with joy the mountain and the forest rung 
 ‘ be every youth like royal abbas moved 
 ‘ and every georgian maid like abra loved 

behold him trav'lling o'er th ’ extensive space 
 between the realms of darkness and our race 
 to pass it , scarcely he a moment took 
 on florence instantly he cast a look 
 delighted with the beauty of the spot 
 he there resolved to fix his earthly lot 
 regarding it as proper for his wiles 
 a city famed for wanton freaks and guiles 
 belphegor soon a noble mansion hired 
 and furnished it with ev'ry thing desired 
 as signor roderick he designed to pass 
 his equipage was large of ev'ry class 
 expense anticipating day by day 
 what , in ten years , he had to throw away 

she gave up beauty in her tender youth 
 gave all her hope and joy and pleasant ways 
 she covered up her eyes lest they should gaze 
 on vanity , and chose the bitter truth 
 harsh towards herself , towards others full of ruth 
 servant of servants , little known to praise 
 long prayers and fasts trenched on her nights and days 
 she schooled herself to sights and sounds uncouth 
 that with the poor and stricken she might make 
 a home , until the least of all sufficed 
 her wants ; her own self learned she to forsake 
 counting all earthly gain but hurt and loss 
 so with calm will she chose and bore the cross 
 and hated all for love of jesus christ 

whome'er the hope , still blasted , still renew 'd 
 of happiness lures on from toil to toil 
 remember mahomet , and cease thy labour 
 behold him here , in love , in war , successful 
 behold him , wretched in his double triumph 
 his fav'rite faithless , and his mistress base 
 ambition only gave her to my arms 
 by reason not convinc 'd , nor won by love 
 ambition was her crime ; but meaner folly 
 dooms me to loathe , at once , and dote on falsehood 
 and idolize th ’ apostate i contemn 
 if thou art more than the gay dream of fancy 
 more than a pleasing sound , without a meaning 
 o happiness ! sure thou art all aspasia 's 

is it her nature , or is it her will 
 to be so cruell to an humbled foe 
 if nature , then she may it mend with skill 
 if will , then she at will may will forgoe 
 but if her nature and her will be so 
 that she will plague the man that loves her most 
 and take delight t'encrease a wretches woe 
 then all her natures goodly guifts are lost 
 and that same glorious beauties ydle boast 
 is but a bayt such wretches to beguile 
 as , being long in her loves tempest tost 
 she meanes at last to make her pitious spoyle 
 o fayrest fayre ! let never it be named 
 that so fayre beauty was so fowly shamed 

by red ripe mouth and brown , luxurious eyes 
 of her i love , by all your sweetness shed 
 in far , fair days , on one whose memory flies 
 to faithless lights , and gracious speech gainsaid 
 i pray you , when yon river path i tread 
 make with the woodlands some soft compromise 
 lest they should vex me into fruitless sighs 
 with visions of a woman 's gleaming head 
 for every green and golden hearted thing 
 that gathers beauty in that shining place 
 beloved of beams and wooed by wind and wing 
 is rife with glimpses of her marvellous face 
 and in the whispers of the lips of spring 
 the music of her lute like voice i trace 

reignin my thoughts , fair hand , sweet eye , rare voice 
 possess me whole , my heart 's triumvirate 
 yet heavy heart , to make so hard a choice 
 of such as spoil thy poor afflicted state 
 for whilst they strive which shall be lord of all 
 all my poor life by them is trodden down 
 they all erect their trophies on my fall 
 and yield me nought that gives them their renown 
 when back i look , i sigh my freedom past 
 and wail the state wherein i present stand 
 and see my fortune ever like to last 
 finding me reined with such a heavy hand 
 what can i do but yield ? and yield i do 
 and serve all three , and yet they spoil me too 

at last , so faire a ladie did i spie 
 that thinking yet on her i burne and quake 
 on hearbs and flowres she walked pensively 
 milde , but yet love she proudly did forsake 
 white seem 'd her robes , yet woven so they were 
 as snow and golde together had been wrought 
 above the wast a darke clowde shrouded her 
 a stinging serpent by the heele her caught 
 wherewith she languisht as the gathered floure 
 and , well assur 'd , she mounted up to ioy 
 alas ! on earth so nothing doth endure 
 but bitter griefe and sorrowfull annoy 
 which make this life wretched and miserable 
 tossed with stormes of fortune variable 

trust me , i have not earned your dear rebuke 
 i love , as you would have me , god the most 
 would lose not him , but you , must one be lost 
 nor with lot 's wife cast back a faithless look 
 unready to forego what i forsook 
 this say i , having counted up the cost 
 this , though i be the feeblest of god 's host 
 the sorriest sheep christ shepherds with his crook 
 yet while i love my god the most , i deem 
 that i can never love you overmuch 
 i love him more , so let me love you too 
 yea , as i apprehend it , love is such 
 i cannot love you if i love not him 
 i cannot love him if i love not you 

lo here the impost of a faith entire 
 that love doth pay , and her disdain extorts 
 behold the message of a chaste desire 
 that tells the world how much my grief imports 
 these tributary passions , beauty 's due 
 i send those eyes , the cabinets of love 
 that cruelty herself might grieve to view 
 th'affliction her unkind disdain doth move 
 and how i live , cast down from off all mirth 
 pensive , alone , only but with despair 
 my joys abortive perish in their birth 
 my griefs long lived and care succeeding care 
 this is my state , and delia 's heart is such 
 i say no more , i fear i said too much 

so if thou hadst been scorned in human eyes 
 too bright and near to be a glory then 
 if as truth 's artist , thou hadst been to men 
 a setter forth of strange divinities 
 to after times , thou , born in midday skies 
 a sun , high up , out blazing sudden , when 
 its light had had its centuries eight and ten 
 to travel through the wretched void that lies 
 ‘ twixt souls and truth , hadst been a love and fear 
 worshipped on high from magian 's mountain crest 
 and all night long symbol 'd by lamp flames clear 
 thy sign , a star upon thy people 's breast 
 where now a strange mysterious shape doth lie 
 that once barred out the sun in noontide sky 

awake — arise ! all my stormy powers 
 the earth , the fair earth , again is ours 
 at my stern approach , pale autumn flings down 
 in the dust her broken and faded crown 
 at my glance the terrified mourner flies 
 and the earth is filled with her doleful cries 
 awake !— for the season of flowers is o'er 
 my white banner unfurl on each northern shore 
 ye have slumbered long in my icy chain 
 ye are free to travel the land and main 
 spirits of frost ! quit your mountains of snow 
 will ye longer suffer the streams to flow 
 up , up , and away from your rocky caves 
 and herald me over the pathless waves 

i have heard the pigeons of the seven woods 
 make their faint thunder , and the garden bees 
 hum in the lime tree flowers ; and put away 
 the unavailing outcries and the old bitterness 
 that empty the heart . i have forgot awhile 
 tara uprooted , and new commonness 
 upon the throne and crying about the streets 
 and hanging its paper flowers from post to post 
 because it is alone of all things happy 
 i am contented for i know that quiet 
 wanders laughing and eating her wild heart 
 among pigeons and bees , while that great archer 
 who but awaits his hour to shoot , still hangs 
 a cloudy quiver over parc na lee 

wait for the morning ! ah ! we wait indeed 
 for daylight , we who toss about through stress 
 of vacant armed desires and emptiness 
 of all the warm , warm touches that we need 
 and the warm kisses upon which we feed 
 our famished lips in fancy ! may god bless 
 the starved lips of us with but one caress 
 warm as the yearning blood our poor hearts bleed 
 a wild prayer —! bite thy pillow , praying so 
 toss this side , and whirl that , and moan for dawn 
 let the clock 's seconds dribble out their woe 
 and time be drained of sorrow ! long ago 
 we heard the crowing cock , with answer drawn 
 as hoarsely sad at throat as sobs ... pray on 

these wordes seyde he for the nones alle 
 that with swich thing he mighte him angry maken 
 and with an angre don his sorwe falle 
 as for the tyme , and his corage awaken 
 but wel he wist , as fer as tonges spaken 
 ther nas a man of gretter hardinesse 
 than he , ne more desired worthinesse 
 ` what cas , ’ quod troilus , ` or what aventure 
 hath gyded thee to see my languisshinge 
 that am refus of euery creature 
 but for the love of god , at my preyinge 
 go henne a way , for certes , my deyinge 
 wol thee disese , and i mot nedes deye 
 ther for go wey , ther is no more to seye 

away they went , and gyges much admired 
 still more than that : in truth his breast was fired 
 for when she moved astonishment was great 
 and ev'ry grace upon her seemed to wait 
 emotion to suppress howe'er he tried 
 since he had promised what he felt to hide 
 to hold his tongue he wished , but that might raise 
 suspicions of designs and mystick ways 
 exaggeration was the better part 
 and from the subject he would never start 
 but fully praised each beauty in detail 
 without appearing any thing to veil 
 gods ! gyges cried , how truly , king , you 're blessed 
 the skin how fair — how charming all the rest 

she looked at him with almost haughty air 
 to think that to reprove her he should dare 
 then fearlessly as some undaunted child 
 she met his eyes that searched her own for truth 
 she who had scorned the tempest dark and wild 
 feared not the chidings of his hasty youth 
 and undismayed she moved to where he stood 
 with blushing , beauteous charms of maidenhood 
 and there with rapt eyes looking up to him 
 she told him of those visions never dim 
 of that wild spirit born amid the storm 
 whose restless strength had swayed her fragile form 
 before his own she laid her very soul 
 that he might there its inmost thoughts unroll 

fair amaryllis , wilt thou never peep 
 from forth the cave , and call me , and be mine 
 lo , apples ten i bear thee from the steep 
 these didst thou long for , and all these are thine 
 ah , would i were a honey bee to sweep 
 through ivy , and the bracken , and woodbine 
 to watch thee waken , love , and watch thee sleep 
 within thy grot below the shadowy pine 
 now know i love , a cruel god is he 
 the wild beast bare him in the wild wood drear 
 and truly to the bone he burneth me 
 but , black browed amaryllis , ne'er a tear 
 nor sigh , nor blush , nor aught have i from thee 
 nay , nor a kiss , a little gift and dear 

surely thou seest , o spirit of light and fire 
 surely thou canst not choose , o soul , but see 
 the days whose dayspring was beheld of thee 
 ere eyes less pure might have their hope 's desire 
 beholding life in heaven again respire 
 where men saw nought that was or was to be 
 save only death imperial . thou and he 
 who has the heart of all men 's hearts for lyre 
 ye twain , being great of spirit as time is great 
 and sure of sight as truth 's own heavenward eye 
 beheld the forms of forces passing by 
 and certitude of equal balanced fate 
 whose breath forefelt makes darkness palpitate 
 and knew that light should live and darkness die 

gazing he spoke , and , kindling at the view 
 his eager arms around the goddess threw 
 glad earth perceives , and from her bosom pours 
 unbidden herbs and voluntary flowers 
 thick new born violets a soft carpet spread 
 and clustering lotos swell ’ d the rising bed 
 and sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow 
 and flamy crocus made the mountain glow 
 there golden clouds conceal the heavenly pair 
 steep ’ d in soft joys and circumfused with air 
 celestial dews , descending o ’ er the ground 
 perfume the mount , and breathe ambrosia round 
 at length , with love and sleep ’ s soft power oppress ’ d 
 the panting thunderer nods , and sinks to rest 

these plaintive verse , the posts of my desire 
 which haste for succour to her slow regard 
 bear not report of any slender fire 
 forging a grief to win a fame 's reward 
 nor are my passions limned for outward hue 
 for that no colours can depaint my sorrows 
 delia herself , and all the world may view 
 best in my face where cares have tilled deep furrows 
 no bays i seek to deck my mourning brow 
 o clear eyed rector of the holy hill 
 my humble accents bear the olive bough 
 of intercession but to move her will 
 these lines i use t'unburden mine own heart 
 my love affects no fame nor ‘ steems of art 

through the hushed street , along the silent plain 
 the spectral future leads its mourning train 
 dark with the shadows of uncounted bands 
 where man 's white lips and woman 's wringing hands 
 track the still burden , rolling slow before 
 that love and kindness can protect no more 
 the smiling babe that , called to mortal strife 
 shuts its meek eyes and drops its little life 
 the drooping child who prays in vain to live 
 and pleads for help its parent cannot give 
 the pride of beauty stricken in its flower 
 the strength of manhood broken in an hour 
 age in its weakness , bowed by toil and care 
 traced in sad lines beneath its silvered hair 

thou art as tyrannous , so as thou art 
 as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel 
 for well thou know'st to my dear doting heart 
 thou art the fairest and most precious jewel 
 yet in good faith some say that thee behold 
 thy face hath not the power to make love groan 
 to say they err , i dare not be so bold 
 although i swear it to my self alone 
 and to be sure that is not false i swear 
 a thousand groans but thinking on thy face 
 one on another 's neck do witness bear 
 thy black is fairest in my judgment 's place 
 in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds 
 and thence this slander as i think proceeds 

since brass , nor stone , nor earth , nor boundless sea 
 but sad mortality o'ersways their power 
 how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea 
 whose action is no stronger than a flower 
 o how shall summer 's honey breath hold out 
 against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days 
 when rocks impregnable are not so stout 
 nor gates of steel so strong but time decays 
 o fearful meditation , where alack 
 shall time 's best jewel from time 's chest lie hid 
 or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back 
 or who his spoil of beauty can forbid 
 o none , unless this miracle have might 
 that in black ink my love may still shine bright 

ah me ! the fifty years since last we met 
 seem to me fifty folios bound and set 
 by time , the great transcriber , on his shelves 
 wherein are written the histories of ourselves 
 what tragedies , what comedies , are there 
 what joy and grief , what rapture and despair 
 what chronicles of triumph and defeat 
 of struggle , and temptation , and retreat 
 what records of regrets , and doubts , and fears 
 what pages blotted , blistered by our tears 
 what lovely landscapes on the margin shine 
 what sweet , angelic faces , what divine 
 and holy images of love and trust 
 undimmed by age , unsoiled by damp or dust 

i see thine image through my tears to night 
 and yet to day i saw thee smiling . how 
 refer the cause ?— beloved , is it thou 
 or i , who makes me sad ? the acolyte 
 amid the chanted joy and thankful rite 
 may so fall flat , with pale insensate brow 
 on the altar stair . i hear thy voice and vow 
 perplexed , uncertain , since thou art out of sight 
 as he , in his swooning ears , the choir 's amen 
 beloved , dost thou love ? or did i see all 
 the glory as i dreamed , and fainted when 
 too vehement light dilated my ideal 
 for my soul 's eyes ? will that light come again 
 as now these tears come — falling hot and real 

it one day happened , that this forward spark 
 the girl we speak of , met within the park 
 and to a summer house the fav'rite drew 
 the course they took the princess chanced to view 
 as wand'ring near ; but neither swain nor fair 
 suspicion had , that any one was there 
 and this gallant most confidently thought 
 the girl by force , might to his terms be brought 
 his wretched temper , obstacle to love 
 and ev'ry bliss bestowed by heav'n above 
 had oft his hopes of favours lately marred 
 and fear , with those designs , had also jarred 
 the girl , howe'er , would likely have been kind 
 if opportunities had pleased her mind 

yet may we not entirely overlook 
 the pleasure gathered from the rudiments 
 of geometric science . though advanced 
 in these inquiries , with regret i speak 
 no farther than the threshold , [ g ] there i found 
 both elevation and composed delight 
 with indian awe and wonder , ignorance pleased 
 with its own struggles , did i meditate 
 on the relation those abstractions bear 
 to nature 's laws , and by what process led 
 those immaterial agents bowed their heads 
 duly to serve the mind of earth born man 
 from star to star , from kindred sphere to sphere 
 from system on to system without end 

then came a postscript dashed across the rest 
 see that there be no traitors in your camp 
 we seem a nest of traitors — none to trust 
 since our arms failed — this egypt plague of men 
 almost our maids were better at their homes 
 than thus man girdled here : indeed i think 
 our chiefest comfort is the little child 
 of one unworthy mother ; which she left 
 she shall not have it back : the child shall grow 
 to prize the authentic mother of her mind 
 i took it for an hour in mine own bed 
 this morning : there the tender orphan hands 
 felt at my heart , and seemed to charm from thence 
 the wrath i nursed against the world : farewell

hard by the road , where on that little mound 
 the high grass rustles to the passing breeze 
 the child of misery rests her head in peace 
 pause there in sadness . that unhallowed ground 
 inshrines what once was isabel . sleep on 
 sleep on , poor outcast ! lovely was thy cheek 
 and thy mild eye was eloquent to speak 
 the soul of pity . pale and woe begone 
 soon did thy fair cheek fade , and thine eye weep 
 the tear of anguish for the babe unborn 
 the helpless heir of poverty and scorn 
 she drank the draught that chill 'd her soul to sleep 
 i pause and wipe the big drop from mine eye 
 whilst the proud levite scowls and passes by 

shot up from broad rank blades that droop below 
 the nodding wheat ear forms a graceful bow 
 with milky kernels starting full , weigh 'd down 
 ere yet the sun hath ting 'd its head with brown 
 whilst thousands in a flock , for ever gay 
 loud chirping sparrows welcome on the day 
 and from the mazes of the leafy thorn 
 drop one by one upon the bending corn 
 giles with a pole assails their close retreats 
 and round the grass grown dewy border beats 
 on either side completely overspread 
 here branches bend , there corn o'ertops his head 
 green covert , hail ! for through the varying year 
 no hours so sweet , no scene to him so dear 

his shadow to narcissus well presented 
 how fair he was by such attractive love 
 so if thou would'st thyself thy beauty prove 
 vulgar breath mirrors might have well contented 
 and to their prayers eternally consented 
 oaths , vows and sighs , if they believe might move 
 but more thou forc'st , making my pen approve 
 thy praise to all , least any had dissented 
 when this hath wrought , thou which before wert known 
 but unto some , of all art now required 
 and thine eyes ’ wonders wronged , because not shown 
 the world , with daily orisons desired 
 thy chaste fair gifts , with learning 's breath is blown 
 and thus my pen hath made thy sweets admired

 thus loudly roaring , and o ’ erpowering all

who stood upon that schooner 's driven deck 
 last night as reefed and shuddering she hove 
 into the twilight and all desperate drove 
 from wave to angrier wave that sought her wreck 
 who labored at her helm and watched the wind 
 stagger the sea with all his stunning might 
 until in dimness dwindling from our sight 
 she vanished in the wrack that rode behind

 that followed as storm petrels o'er the waves 
 felt all the might of him who sinks or saves 
 and all the pity of earth 's unreached goals 
 felt all — then swift returning to our love 
 dwelt in its peace , uplifted safe above 

to live in hell , and heaven to behold 
 to welcome life , and die a living death 
 to sweat with heat , and yet be freezing cold 
 to grasp at stars , and lie the earth beneath 
 to treat a maze that never shall have end 
 to burn in sighs , and starve in daily tears 
 to climb a hill , and never to descend 
 giants to kill , and quake at childish fears 
 to pine for food , and watch th ’ hesperian tree 
 to thirst for drink , and nectar still to draw 
 to live accurs 'd whom men hold blest to be 
 and weep those wrongs which never creature saw 
 if this be love , if love in these be founded 
 my heart is love , for these in it are grounded

 alas , i may not ; thou art likewise dear 
 i am but human , and thou hast a tear 
 when she hath nought but splendour , and the glow 
 of a wild energy that mocks the flow 
 of the poor sympathies which keep us here 
 lay past thy poppies , and come twice as near 
 and i will teach thee , and thou too shalt grow 
 and thou shalt walk with me in open day 
 through the rough thoroughfares with quiet grace 
 and the wild visaged maid shall lead the way 
 timing her footsteps to a gentler pace 
 as her great orbs turn ever on thy face 
 drinking in draughts of loving help alway

are there two things , of all which men possess 
 that are so like each other and so near 
 as mutual love seems like to happiness 
 dear asra , woman beyond utterance dear 
 this love which ever welling at my heart 
 now in its living fount doth heave and fall 
 now overflowing pours thro ’ every part 
 of all my frame , and fills and changes all 
 like vernal waters springing up through snow 
 this love that seeming great beyond the power 
 of growth , yet seemeth ever more to grow 
 could i transmute the whole to one rich dower 
 of happy life , and give it all to thee 
 thy lot , methinks , were heaven , thy age , eternity

 alive upon the earth . and i have bent 
 regard on many a woman , who gave sign

 that shaped each float and fold of beauty 's tent

cold , cold we rested on black peaks again 
 under black skies , under a groping wind 
 and life , grown old , hugged me to a numb breast 
 pressing numb lips against me . suddenly 
 a blade of silver severed the black peaks 
 from the black sky , and earth was born again 
 breathing and various , under a god 's feet 
 a god ! a god ! i felt the heart of life 
 leap under me , and my cold flanks shook again 
 he bore no lyre , he rang no challenge out 
 but life warmed to him , warming me with her 
 and as he neared i felt beneath her hands 
 the stab of a new wound that sucked my soul 
 forth in a new song from my throbbing throat 

shall a man die before his dying day 
 death ? and for him though the utter day be nigh 
 not yet , not yet we give him leave to die 
 we give him grace not yet that men should say 
 he is dead , wiped out , perished and past away 
 till the last bitterness of life go by 
 thou shalt not slay him ; till those last dregs run dry 
 o thou last lord of life ! thou shalt not slay 
 let the lips live a little while and lie 
 the hand a little , and falter , and fail of strength 
 and the soul shudder and sicken at the sky 
 yea , let him live , though god nor man would let 
 save for the curse ’ sake ; then at bitter length 
 lord , will we yield him to thee , but not yet

 us well acquainted with this place : but here 
 we , as yourselves , are strangers . not long erst 
 we came , before you but a little space 
 by other road so rough and hard , that now 
 the ’ ascent will seem to us as play . ” the spirits 
 who from my breathing had perceiv 'd i liv 'd 
 grew pale with wonder . as the multitude 
 flock round a herald , sent with olive branch 
 to hear what news he brings , and in their haste 
 tread one another down , e'en so at sight 
 of me those happy spirits were fix 'd , each one 
 forgetful of its errand , to depart 
 where cleans 'd from sin , it might be made all fair 

gold , and fair marbles , and again more gold 
 and space of halls afloat that glance and gleam 
 like the green heights of sunset heaven , or seem 
 the golden steeps of sunrise red and cold 
 on deserts where dark exile keeps the fold 
 fast of the flocks of torment , where no beam 
 falls of kind light or comfort save in dream 
 these we far off behold not , who behold 
 the cordage woven of curses , and the decks 
 with mortal hate and mortal peril paven 
 from stem to stern the lines of doom engraven 
 that mark for sure inevitable wrecks 
 those sails predestinate , though no storm vex 
 to miss on earth and find in hell their haven 

man rising to the doom that shall not err 
 which hath most dread : the arouse of all or each 
 all kindreds of all nations of all speech 
 or one by one of him and him and her 
 while dust reanimate begins to stir 
 here , there , beyond , beyond , reach beyond reach 
 while every wave refashions on the beach 
 alive or dead in life some seafarer 
 now meeting doth not join or parting part 
 true meeting and true parting wait till then 
 when whoso meet are joined for evermore 
 face answering face and heart at rest in heart

 of happy heaven , his sheep home to the pen 

but i have looked on pictures made by man 
 wherein , at first , appeared but chaos wild 
 so high the art transcended , it beguiled 
 the eye as formless , and without a plan 
 until the spirit , brooding o'er , began 
 to see a purpose rise , like mountains piled 
 when god said : let the dry earth , undefiled 
 rise from the waves : it rose in twilight wan 
 and so i fear thy pictures were too strange 
 for us to pierce beyond their outmost look 
 a vapour and a darkness ; a sealed book 
 an atmosphere too high for wings to range 
 at god 's designs our spirits pale and change 
 trembling as at a void , thought cannot brook 

man , earth 's poor shadow ! talks of earth 's decay 
 but hath it nothing of eternal kin 
 no majesty that shall not pass away 
 no soul of greatness springing up within 
 thought marks without hoar shadows of sublime 
 pictures of power , which if not doomed to win 
 eternity , stand laughing at old time 
 for ages : in the grand ancestral line 
 of things eternal , mounting to divine 
 i read magnificence where ages pay 
 worship like conquered foes to the apennine 
 because they could not conquer . there sits day 
 too high for night to come at — mountains shine 
 outpeering time , too lofty for decay 

were this to happen now , scamander 's stream 
 would not so easily preserve esteem 
 but crimes like these ( whoever was abused 
 in former days , were easily excused 
 with time our maxims change , and what was then 
 though wrong at present , may prevail agen 
 scamander 's spouse some raillery received 
 but in the end she fully was relieved 
 a lover e'en superior thought her charms 
 ( his taste was such ) and took her to his arms 
 the gods can nothing spoil ! but should they cause 
 a belle to lose a portion of applause 
 a handsome fortune give , and you 'll behold 
 that ev'ry thing can be repaired by gold 

he sniffs the chilly air ; ( his dreaming starts 
 he 's riding in a dusty sussex lane 
 in quiet september ; slowly night departs 
 and he 's a living soul , absolved from pain 
 beyond the brambled fences where he goes 
 are glimmering fields with harvest piled in sheaves 
 and tree tops dark against the stars grown pale 
 then , clear and shrill , a distant farm cock crows 
 and there 's a wall of mist along the vale 
 where willows shake their watery sounding leaves 
 he gazes on it all , and scarce believes 
 that earth is telling its old peaceful tale 
 he thanks the blessed world that he was born 
 then , far away , a lonely note of the horn 

fair star of evening , splendor of the west 
 star of my country ! on the horizon 's brink 
 thou hangest , stooping , as might seem , to sink 
 on england 's bosom ; yet well pleas 'd to rest 
 meanwhile , and be to her a glorious crest 
 conspicuous to the nations . thou , i think 
 should'st be my country 's emblem ; and should'st wink 
 bright star ! with laughter on her banners , drest 
 in thy fresh beauty . there ! that dusky spot 
 beneath thee , it is england ; there it lies 
 blessings be on you both ! one hope , one lot 
 one life , one glory ! i , with many a fear 
 for my dear country , many heartfelt sighs 
 among men who do not love her linger here 

milton ! thou shouldst be living at this hour 
 england hath need of thee ; she is a fen 
 of stagnant waters ; altar , sword , and pen 
 fireside , the heroic wealth of hall and bower 
 have forfeited their ancient english dower 
 of inward happiness . we are selfish men 
 oh ! raise us up , return to us again 
 and give us manners , virtue , freedom , power 
 thy soul was like a star , and dwelt apart 
 thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea 
 pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free 
 so didst thou travel on life 's common way 
 in cheerful godliness ; and yet thy heart 
 the lowliest duties on herself did lay 

a lily girl , not made for this world 's pain 
 with brown , soft hair close braided by her ears 
 and longing eyes half veiled by slumberous tears 
 like bluest water seen through mists of rain 
 pale cheeks whereon no love hath left its stain 
 red underlip drawn in for fear of love 
 and white throat , whiter than the silvered dove 
 through whose wan marble creeps one purple vein 
 yet , though my lips shall praise her without cease 
 even to kiss her feet i am not bold 
 being o'ershadowed by the wings of awe 
 like dante , when he stood with beatrice 
 beneath the flaming lion 's breast , and saw 
 the seventh crystal , and the stair of gold 

they dub thee idler , smiling sneeringly 
 and why ? because , forsooth , so many moons 
 here dwelling voiceless by the voiceful sea 
 thou hast not set thy thoughts to paltry tunes 
 in song or sonnet . them these golden noons 
 oppress not with their beauty ; they could prate 
 even while a prophet read the solemn runes 
 on which is hanging some imperial fate 
 how know they , these good gossips , what to thee 
 the ocean and its wanderers may have brought 
 how know they , in their busy vacancy 
 with what far aim thy spirit may be fraught 
 or that thou dost not bow thee silently 
 before some great unutterable thought

the winter wind is raving fierce and shrill 
 and chides with angry moan the frosty skies 
 the white stars gaze with sleepless gorgon eyes 
 that freeze the earth in terror fixed and still 
 we reck not of the wild night 's gloom and chill 
 housed from its rage , dear friend ; and fancy flies 
 lured by the hand of beckoning memories 
 back to those summer evenings on the hill 
 where we together watched the sun go down

thus lysias spoke , and ended . i confess 
 this story of poor judas touched me much 
 what horrible revulsions must have passed 
 across that spirit in those few last hours 
 what storms , that tore up life even to its roots 
 say what you will — grant all the guilt — and still 
 what pangs of dread remorse — what agonies 
 of desperate repentance , all too late 
 in that wild interval between the crime 
 and its last sad atonement !— life , the while 
 laden with horror all too great to bear 
 and pressing madly on to death 's abyss 
 this was no common mind that thus could feel 
 no vulgar villain sinning for reward

 her beautiful blonde hair . ah ! would these black

 why seize ye not yon beeves , and fleecy prey 
 arise unanimous ; arise and slay 
 and if the gods ordain a safe return 
 to phoebus shrines shall rise , and altars burn 
 but should the powers that o'er mankind preside 
 decree to plunge us in the whelming tide 
 better to rush at once to shades below 
 than linger life away , and nourish woe 

remember me when i am gone away 
 gone far away into the silent land 
 when you can no more hold me by the hand 
 nor i half turn to go yet turning stay 
 remember me when no more day by day 
 you tell me of our future that you planned 
 only remember me ; you understand 
 it will be late to counsel then or pray 
 yet if you should forget me for a while 
 and afterwards remember , do not grieve 
 for if the darkness and corruption leave 
 a vestige of the thoughts that once i had 
 better by far you should forget and smile 
 than that you should remember and be sad 

i cannot think that thou shouldst pass away 
 whose life to mine is an eternal law 
 a piece of nature that can have no flaw 
 a new and certain sunrise every day 
 but , if thou art to be another ray 
 about the sun of life , and art to live 
 free from what part of thee was fugitive 
 the debt of love i will more fully pay 
 not downcast with the thought of thee so high 
 but rather raised to be a nobler man 
 and more divine in my humanity 
 as knowing that the waiting eyes which scan 
 my life are lighted by a purer being 
 and ask high , calm browed deeds , with it agreeing 

dares he behold the thing he is , what thing 
 he would become is in his mind its child 
 astir , demanding birth to light and wing 
 for battle prompt , by pleasure unbeguiled 
 so moves he forth in faith , if he has made 
 his mind god 's temple , dedicate to truth 
 earth 's nourishing delights , no more gainsaid 
 he tastes , as doth the bridegroom rich in youth 
 then knows he love , that beckons and controls 
 the star of sky upon his footway cast 
 then match in him who holds his tempters fast 
 the body 's love and mind 's , whereof the soul 's 
 then earth her man for woman finds at last 
 to speed the pair unto her goal of goals 

some foreign writers , some our own despise 
 the ancients only , or the moderns prize 
 thus wit , like faith , by each man is applied 
 to one small sect , and all are damned beside 
 meanly they seek the blessing to confine 
 and force that sun but on a part to shine 
 which not alone the southern wit sublimes 
 but ripens spirits in cold northern climes 
 which from the first has shone on ages past 
 enlights the present , and shall warm the last 
 though each may feel increases and decays 
 and see now clearer and now darker days 
 regard not , then , if wit be old or new 
 but blame the false , and value still the true 

joy of the milliner , envy of the line 
 star of the parks , jack booted , sworded , helmed 
 he sits between his holsters , solid of spine 
 nor , as it seems , though westminster were whelmed 
 with the great globe , in earthquake and eclipse 
 would he and his charger cease from mounting guard 
 this private in the blues , nor would his lips 
 move , though his gorge with throttled oaths were charred 
 he wears his inches weightily , as he wears 
 his old world armours ; and with his port and pride 
 his sturdy graces and enormous airs 
 he towers , in speech his colonel countrified 
 a triumph , waxing statelier year by year 
 of british blood , and bone , and beef , and beer 

he 's gone — here rest , my soul , thy fainting wing 
 here recollect thy dissipated pow'rs 
 our distant int'rests , and our diff'rent passions 
 now haste to mingle in one common centre 
 and fate lies crowded in a narrow space 
 yet , in that narrow space what dangers rise 
 far more i dread abdalla 's fiery folly 
 than all the wisdom of the grave divan 
 reason with reason fights on equal terms 
 the raging madman 's unconnected schemes 
 we cannot obviate , for we cannot guess 
 deep in my breast be treasur 'd this resolve 
 when cali mounts the throne , abdalla dies 
 too fierce , too faithless , for neglect or trust 

licia my love was sitting in a grove 
 tuning her smiles unto the chirping songs 
 but straight she spied where two together strove 
 each one complaining of the other 's wrongs 
 cupid did cry lamenting of the harm 
 jove 's messenger , thou wrong'st me too too far 
 use thou thy rod , rely upon the charm 
 think not by speech my force thou canst debar 
 a rod , sir boy , were fitter for a child 
 my weapons oft and tongue and mind you took 
 and in my wrong at my distress thou smiled 
 and scorned to grace me with a loving look 
 speak you , sweet love , for you did all the wrong 
 that broke his arrows , and did bind his tongue 

and beatrice : “ the first diving soul 
 that ever the first virtue fram 'd , admires 
 within these rays his maker . ” like the leaf 
 that bows its lithe top till the blast is blown 
 by its own virtue rear 'd then stands aloof 
 so i , the whilst she said , awe stricken bow 'd 
 then eagerness to speak embolden 'd me 
 and i began : “ o fruit ! that wast alone 
 mature , when first engender 'd ! ancient father 
 that doubly seest in every wedded bride 
 thy daughter by affinity and blood 
 devoutly as i may , i pray thee hold 
 converse with me : my will thou seest ; and i 
 more speedily to hear thee , tell it not 

master of human destinies am i 
 fame , love , and fortune on my footsteps wait 
 cities and fields i walk ; i penetrate 
 deserts and seas remote , and , passing by 
 hovel and mart and palace , soon or late 
 i knock , unbidden , once at every gate 
 if sleeping , wake — if feasting , rise — before 
 i turn away . it is the hour of fate 
 and they who follow me reach every state 
 mortals desire , and conquer every foe 
 save death ; but those who doubt , or hesitate 
 condemned to failure , penury , and woe 
 seek me in vain and uselessly implore 
 i answer not , and i return no more 

some time ago from rome , in smart array 
 a younger brother homeward bent his way 
 not much improved , as frequently the case 
 with those who travel to that famous place 
 upon the road oft finding , where he stayed 
 delightful wines , and handsome belle or maid 
 with careless ease he loitered up and down 
 one day there passed him in a country town 
 attended by a page , a lady fair 
 whose charming form and all engaging air 
 at once his bosom fired with fond desire 
 and nearer still , her beauties to admire 
 he most gallantly saw her safely home 
 attentions charm the sex where'er we roam 

i am older than nature and her time 
 by all the timeless age of consciousness 
 and my adult oblivion of the clime 
 where i was born makes me not countryless 
 ay , and dim through my daylight thoughts escape 
 yearnings for that land where my childhood dreamed 
 which i cannot recall in colour or shape 
 but haunts my hours like something that hath gleamed 
 and yet is not as light remembered 
 nor to the left or to the right conceived 
 and all round me tastes as if life were dead 
 and the world made but to be disbelieved 
 thus i my hope on unknown truth lay ; yet 
 how but by hope do i the unknown truth get 

yet more than tropic 's soft abundance thralling 
 my stormy north land wilderness is calling 
 her snowflake flocks , her gleaming midnight frosts 
 the glory of grim forests on her coasts 
 green tinted steppes with distant bluish rim 
 the trooping clouds in heaven 's spaces dim 
 unto the heart how the familiar cries 
 the village mean that in the valley lies 
 the wealthy cities ’ towering majesty 
 the empty snow fields ’ endless boundary 
 the changeful moods that all unbridled throng 
 spirit of russia and of russian song 
 with joy now gushing forth ,— with pain now ringing 
 unto the hearer 's heart resistless singing 

all that which aegypt whilome did devise 
 all that which greece their temples to embrave 
 after th'ionicke , atticke , doricke guise 
 or corinth skil 'd in curious workes to grave 
 all that lysippus practike * arte could forme 
 apelles wit , or phidias his skill 
 was wont this auncient citie to adorne 
 and the heaven it selfe with her wide wonders fill 
 all that which athens ever brought forth wise 
 all that which afrike ever brought forth strange 
 all that which asie ever had of prise 
 was here to see . o mervelous great change 
 rome , living , was the worlds sole ornament 
 and , dead , is now the worlds sole moniment 

then thus the son : “ from alybas i came 
 my palace there ; eperitus my name 
 not vulgar born : from aphidas , the king 
 of polyphemon 's royal line , i spring

lear and cordelia ! ‘ twas an ancient tale 
 before thy shakespeare gave it deathless fame 
 the times have changed , the moral is the same 
 so like an outcast , dowerless and pale 
 thy daughter went ; and in a foreign gale 
 spread her young banner , till its sway became 
 a wonder to the nations . days of shame 
 are close upon thee ; prophets raise their wail 
 when the rude cossack with an outstretched hand 
 points his long spear across the narrow sea 
 “ lo ! there is england ! ” when thy destiny 
 storms on thy straw crowned head , and thou dost stand

how soon hath time , the subtle thief of youth 
 stolen on his wing my three and twentieth year 
 my hasting days fly on with full career 
 but my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th 
 perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth 
 that i to manhood am arrived so near 
 and inward ripeness doth much less appear 
 that some more timely happy spirits endu'th 
 yet , be it less or more , or soon or slow 
 it shall be still in strictest measure even 
 to that same lot , however mean or high 
 toward which time leads me , and the will of heaven 
 all is , if i have grace to use it so 
 as ever in my great task master 's eye 

thou tyrannizing monarch that dost tire 
 my love sick heart through those assaulting eyes 
 that are the lamps which lighten my desire 
 if nought but death thy fury may suffice 
 not for my peace , but for thy pleasure be it 
 that phillis , wrathful phillis that repines me 
 all grace but death , may deign to come and see it 
 and seeing grieve at that which she assigns me 
 this only boon for all my mortal bane 
 i crave and cry for at thy mercy seat 
 that when her wrath a faithful heart hath slain 
 and soul is fled , and body reft of heat 
 she might perceive how much she might command 
 that had my life and death within her hand 

she turned away ; he turned again to sleep 
 that no god troubled now , and , wondering 
 what matters were afoot among the sidhe 
 maeve walked through that great hall , and with a sigh 
 lifted the curtain of her sleeping room 
 remembering that she too had seemed divine 
 to many thousand eyes , and to her own 
 one that the generations had long waited 
 that work too difficult for mortal hands 
 might be accomplished . bunching the curtain up 
 she saw her husband ailell sleeping there 
 and thought of days when he 'd had a straight body 
 and of that famous fergus , nessa 's husband 
 who had been the lover of her middle life 

my love was masked , and arm è d with a fan 
 to see the sun so careless of his light 
 which stood and gazed , and gazing wax è d wan 
 to see a star himself that was more bright 
 some did surmize she hid her from the sun 
 of whom in pride she scorned for to be kissed 
 or feared the harm by him to others done 
 but these the reason of this wonder missed 
 nor durst the sun , if that her face were bare 
 in greatest pride , presume to take a kiss 
 but she more kind did show she had more care 
 than with her eyes eclipse him of his bliss 
 unmask you , sweet , and spare not ; dim the sun 
 your light 's enough , although that his were done 

but art made fierce reply , “ anathema 
 on you who fill flesh but the spirit scorn 
 who give it to the unrequiting law 
 of your brute soullessness and heart unborn 
 to aught than barter in your low bazaar 
 though beauty die for it from star to star 
 you are the god of judas and those who 
 betrayed him unto nail and thorn and sword 
 of that relentless worm bit florence horde 
 who drove lone dante from them till he grew 
 so great in death they begged his bones to strew 
 their pride and wealth and useless praise upon 
 anathema ! i cry ; and will , till none 
 of all earth 's children still shall worship you 

so there he paused and calmly closed his eyes 
 and silently i sat and held his hand 
 after a time , when we were left alone 
 he spoke again with calmer voice and said 
 “ captain , you oft have asked my history 
 and i as oft refused . there is no cause 
 why i should longer hold it from my friend 
 who reads the closing chapter . it may teach 
 one soul to lean upon the arm of christ 
 that hope and happiness find anchorage 
 only in heaven . while my lonesome life 
 saw death but dimly in the dull distance 
 my lips were sealed to the unhappy tale 
 under my pride i hid a heavy heart 

spit in my face , you jews , and pierce my side 
 buffet and scoff , scourge and crucify me 
 for i have sinned , and sinned , and only he 
 who could do no iniquity hath died 
 but by my death cannot be satisfied 
 my sins , which pass the jews ’ impiety 
 they killed once an inglorious man , but i 
 crucify him daily , being now glorified 
 o let me then his strange love still admire 
 kings pardon , but he bore our punishment 
 and jacob came , clothed in vile harsh attire 
 but to supplant , and with gainful intent 
 god clothed himself in vile man 's flesh , that so 
 he might be weak enough to surfer woe 

like as the dove , which seeled up doth fly 
 is neither freed , nor yet to service bound 
 but hopes to gain some help by mounting high 
 till want of force do force her fall to ground 
 right so my mind , caught by his guiding eye 
 and thence cast off where his sweet hurt he found 
 hath neither leave to live , nor doom to die 
 nor held in evil , nor suffered to be sound 
 but with his wings of fancies up he goes 
 to high conceits , whose fruits are oft but small 
 till wounded , blind , and wearied spirit , lose 
 both force to fly , and knowledge where to fall 
 o happy dove , if she no bondage tried 
 more happy i , might i in bondage bide 

as that great seer , whose animating rod 
 taught jacob 's sons their wonder working god 
 who led thro dreary wastes the murmuring band 
 and reach 'd the confines of their promised land 
 opprest with years , from pisgah 's towering height 
 on fruitful canaan feasted long his sight 
 the bliss of unborn nations warm 'd his breast 
 repaid his toils and sooth 'd his soul to rest 
 thus o'er thy subject wave shalt thou behold 
 far happier realms their future charms unfold 
 in nobler pomp another pisgah rise 
 beneath whose foot thy new found canaan lies 
 there , rapt in vision , hail my favorite clime 
 and taste the blessings of remotest time 

yes ! let the rich deride , the proud disdain 
 these simple blessings of the lowly train 
 to me more dear , congenial to my heart 
 one native charm , than all the gloss of art 
 spontaneous joys , where nature has its play 
 the soul adopts , and owns their first born sway 
 lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind 
 unenvied , unmolested , unconfined 
 but the long pomp , the midnight masquerade 
 with all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed 
 in these , ere triflers half their wish obtain 
 the toiling pleasure sickens into pain 
 and , e'en while fashion 's brightest arts decoy 
 the heart distrusting asks if this be joy 

the world was in its day of peril dark 
 wont to believe the dotage of fond love 
 from the fair cyprian deity , who rolls 
 in her third epicycle , shed on men 
 by stream of potent radiance : therefore they 
 of elder time , in their old error blind 
 not her alone with sacrifice ador 'd 
 and invocation , but like honours paid 
 to cupid and dione , deem 'd of them 
 her mother , and her son , him whom they feign 'd 
 to sit in dido 's bosom : and from her 
 whom i have sung preluding , borrow 'd they 
 the appellation of that star , which views 
 now obvious and now averse , the sun 

then do i love and draw this weary breath 
 for her , the cruel fair , within whose brow 
 i written find the sentence of my death 
 in unkind letters wrote she cares not how 
 thou power that rul'st the confines of the night 
 laughter loving goddess , worldly pleasures ’ queen 
 intenerate that heart that sets so light 
 the truest love that ever yet was seen 
 and cause her leave to triumph in this wise 
 upon the prostrate spoil of that poor heart 
 that serves , a trophy to her conquering eyes 
 and must their glory to the world impart 
 once let her know sh'hath done enough to prove me 
 and let her pity if she cannot love me 

the everlasting grass — how bright , how cool 
 the day has gone too suddenly , too soon 
 there 's something white and shiny in that pool 
 throw in a stone , and you will hit the moon 
 listen , the church bell ringing ! do not say 
 we must go back to morrow to our work 
 we 'll tell them we are dead : we died to day 
 we 're lazy . we 're too happy . we will shirk 
 we 're cows . we 're kettles . we 'll be anything 
 except the manikins of time and fear 
 we 'll start away to morrow wandering 
 and nobody will notice in a year 
 now the great sun is slipping under ground 
 grip firmly !— how the earth is whirling round 

“ ay ! quail and cringe and crook the supple knee 
 and beg thy life of me , thine enemy 
 whom thou , a moment since , didst doom to death 
 i will not breathe suspicion 's lightest breath 
 against thy vaunted fame : and even though 
 before all men thou'st sworn thyself my foe 
 and pledged thyself wrongly to wreak on me 
 thy utmost power of mortal injury 
 in spite of this , should i be first to die 
 and win the bowers of the blest on high 
 beside the golden gate of paradise 
 thee will i wait with ever watchful eyes 
 ready to plead forgiveness for thy sin 
 if thou shouldst come , and shouldst not enter in 

god 's child in christ adopted ,— christ my all 
 what that earth boasts were not lost cheaply , rather 
 than forfeit that blest name , by which i call 
 the holy one , the almighty god , my father 
 father ! in christ we live , and christ in thee 
 eternal thou , and everlasting we 
 the heir of heaven , henceforth i fear not death 
 in christ i live ! in christ i draw the breath 
 of the true life !— let then earth , sea , and sky 
 make war against me ! on my heart i show 
 their mighty master 's seal . in vain they try 
 to end my life , that can but end its woe 
 is that a death bed where a christian lies 
 yes ! but not his — ‘ tis death itself there dies 

england , i stand on thy imperial ground 
 not all a stranger ; as thy bugles blow 
 i feel within my blood old battles flow 
 the blood whose ancient founts in thee are found 
 still surging dark against the christian bound 
 wide islam presses ; well its peoples know 
 thy heights that watch them wandering below 
 i think how lucknow heard their gathering sound 
 i turn and meet the cruel turbaned face 
 england , ‘ tis sweet to be so much thy son 
 i feel the conqueror in my blood and race 
 last night trafalgar awed me , and to day 
 gibraltar wakened ; hark , thy evening gun 
 startles the desert over africa 

friend , whom thy fourscore winters leave more dear 
 than when life 's roseate summer on thy cheek 
 burned in the flush of manhood 's manliest year 
 lonely , how lonely ! is the snowy peak 
 thy feet have reached , and mine have climbed so near 
 close on thy footsteps ‘ mid the landscape drear 
 i stretch my hand thine answering grasp to seek 
 warm with the love no rippling rhymes can speak 
 look backward ! from thy lofty height survey 
 thy years of toil , of peaceful victories won 
 of dreams made real , largest hopes outrun 
 look forward ! brighter than earth 's morning ray 
 streams the pure light of heaven 's unsetting sun 
 the unclouded dawn of life 's immortal day 

to speak of him in language of our own 
 is not for us too daringly to try 
 but , saviour , we can read thy history 
 upon the faces round thy humble throne 
 and as the flower among the grass makes known 
 what summer suns have warmed it from the sky 
 as every human smile and human sigh 
 is witness that we do not live alone 
 so in that company — in those sweet tears 
 the first born of a rugged melted heart 
 in those gaunt chains for ever torn apart 
 and in the words that weeping mother hears 
 we read the story of two thousand years 
 and know thee somewhat , saviour , as thou art 

oh ! yet within the tent i see thee lie 
 the victor , like a coward , crouching by 
 o'erawed , rebuked , and humbled in the hour 
 the plenitude of his success and power 
 a pain the guilty never make us know 
 in all the miseries they cause below 
 a pain which they in every triumph feel 
 a humbling sense no glory yet could heal 
 the want of conscious worth , the poignant thought 
 that inwardly sets all pretence at naught 
 that curbs all self applause — tears all disguise 
 when the subdued , the ruin 'd can despise 
 and , in the arms of death , can yet be free 
 to say , “ let me be any thing but thee 

so went our boys when edward sixth , the king 
 chartered christ 's hospital , and died . and so 
 full fifteen generations in a string 
 of heirs to his bequest have had to go 
 thus camden showed , and barnes , and stilling fleet 
 and richardson , that bade our lovelace be 
 the little elia thus in newgate street 
 thus to his genevieve young s. t. c 
 with thousands else that , wandering up and down 
 quaint , privileged , liked and reputed well 
 made the great school a part of london town 
 patent as paul 's and vital as bow bell 
 the old school nearing exile , day by day 
 to certain clay lands somewhere horsham way 

“ by what wild passion , furious ! art thou toss ’ d 
 striv ’ st thou with jove ? thou art already lost

to fly from vice is virtue : to be free 
 from foolishness is wisdom 's first degree 
 think of some ill you feel a real disgrace 
 the loss of money or the loss of place 
 to keep yourself from these , how keen the strain 
 how dire the sweat of body and of brain 
 through tropic heat , o'er rocks and seas you run 
 to furthest india , poverty to shun 
 yet scorn the sage who offers you release 
 from vagrant wishes that disturb your peace 
 take some provincial pugilist , who gains 
 a paltry cross way prize for all his pains

 without a struggle , would the gift be spurned 

when winter snows upon thy sable hairs 
 and frost of age hath nipped thy beauties near 
 when dark shall seem thy day that never clears 
 and all lies withered that was held so dear 
 then take this picture which i here present thee 
 limned with a pencil not all unworthy 
 here see the gifts that god and nature lent thee 
 here read thyself and what i suffered for thee 
 this may remain thy lasting monument 
 which happily posterity may cherish 
 these colours with thy fading are not spent 
 these may remain when thou and i shall perish 
 if they remain , then thou shalt live thereby 
 they will remain , and so thou canst not die 

ah ! changed and cold , how changed and very cold 
 with stiffened smiling lips and cold calm eyes 
 changed , yet the same ; much knowing , little wise 
 this was the promise of the days of old 
 grown hard and stubborn in the ancient mould 
 grown rigid in the sham of lifelong lies 
 we hoped for better things as years would rise 
 but it is over as a tale once told 
 all fallen the blossom that no fruitage bore 
 all lost the present and the future time 
 all lost , all lost , the lapse that went before 
 so lost till death shut to the opened door 
 so lost from chime to everlasting chime 
 so cold and lost for ever evermore

 more fierce he 's found than lion or leopard

the crimson panes like blood drops stigmatise 
 the western floor . the aisles are mute and cold 
 a rigid fetich in her robe of gold 
 the virgin of the pillar , with blank eyes 
 enthroned beneath her votive canopies 
 gathers a meagre remnant to her fold 
 the rest is solitude ; the church , grown old 
 stands stark and grey beneath the burning skies 
 well nigh again its mighty framework grows 
 to be a part of nature 's self , withdrawn 
 from hot humanity 's impatient woes 
 the floor is ridged like some rude mountain lawn 
 and in the east one giant window shows 
 the roseate coldness of an alp at dawn 

methought that in a solemn church i stood 
 its marble acres , worn with knees and feet 
 lay spread from door to door , from street to street 
 midway the form hung high upon the rood 
 of him who gave his life to be our good 
 beyond , priests flitted , bowed , and murmured meet 
 among the candles , shining still and sweet 
 men came and went , and worshipped as they could 
 and still their dust a woman with her broom 
 bowed to her work , kept sweeping to the door 
 then saw i , slow through all the pillared gloom 
 across the church a silent figure come 
 “ daughter , ” it said , “ thou sweepest well my floor 
 “ it is the lord ! ” i cried , and saw no more 

canst thou o cruel , say i love thee not 
 when i against my self with thee partake 
 do i not think on thee when i forgot 
 am of my self , all tyrant , for thy sake 
 who hateth thee that i do call my friend 
 on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon 
 nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend 
 revenge upon my self with present moan 
 what merit do i in my self respect 
 that is so proud thy service to despise 
 when all my best doth worship thy defect 
 commanded by the motion of thine eyes 
 but love hate on for now i know thy mind 
 those that can see thou lov'st , and i am blind 

i pray you not , leuconoe , to pore 
 with unpermitted eyes on what may be 
 appointed by the gods for you and me 
 nor on chaldean figures any more 
 ‘ t were infinitely better to implore 
 the present only : — whether jove decree 
 more winters yet to come , or whether he 
 make even this , whose hard , wave eaten shore 
 shatters the tuscan seas to day , the last 
 be wise withal , and rack your wine , nor fill 
 your bosom with large hopes ; for while i sing 
 the envious close of time is narrowing 
 so seize the day , — or ever it be past 
 and let the morrow come for what it will 

o gracious mother , whose benignant breast 
 wakes us to life , and lulls us all to rest 
 how thy sweet features , kind to every clime 
 mock with their smile the wrinkled front of time 
 we stain thy flowers ,— they blossom o'er the dead 
 we rend thy bosom , and it gives us bread 
 o'er the red field that trampling strife has torn 
 waves the green plumage of thy tasselled corn 
 our maddening conflicts sear thy fairest plain 
 still thy soft answer is the growing grain 
 yet , o our mother , while uncounted charms 
 steal round our hearts in thine embracing arms 
 let not our virtues in thy love decay 
 and thy fond sweetness waste our strength away 

from upland slopes i see the cows file by 
 lowing , great chested , down the homeward trail 
 by dusking fields and meadows shining pale 
 with moon tipped dandelions . flickering high 
 a peevish night hawk in the western sky 
 beats up into the lucent solitudes 
 or drops with griding wing . the stilly woods 
 grow dark and deep and gloom mysteriously 
 cool night winds creep , and whisper in mine ear 
 the homely cricket gossips at my feet 
 from far off pools and wastes of reeds i hear 
 clear and soft piped , the chanting frogs break sweet 
 in full pandean chorus . one by one 
 shine out the stars , and the great night comes on 

‘ man is of soul and body , formed for deeds 
 of high resolve , on fancy 's boldest wing 
 to soar unwearied , fearlessly to turn 
 the keenest pangs to peacefulness , and taste 
 the joys which mingled sense and spirit yield 
 or he is formed for abjectness and woe 
 to grovel on the dunghill of his fears 
 to shrink at every sound , to quench the flame 
 of natural love in sensualism , to know 
 that hour as blessed when on his worthless days 
 the frozen hand of death shall set its seal 
 yet fear the cure , though hating the disease 
 the one is man that shall hereafter be 
 the other , man as vice has made him now 

then meeting street first knew st. michael 's steeple 
 when redcoats marched with royal drums a banging 
 or merchants stopped gowned tutors to inquire 
 why school let out to see a pirate hanging 
 and gentlemen took supper in the street 
 when candle shine from tables guled the dark 
 while others passing by would be discreet 
 and take the farther side without remark 
 pausing perhaps to snuff the balmy savor 
 of turtle soup mulled with the bay leaves ’ flavor 
 these walls beheld them , and these lingering trees 
 that still preempt the middle of the gutter 
 they are the backdrops for old comedies 
 if leaves were tongues — what stories they might utter 

when thou shalt be disposed to set me light 
 and place my merit in the eye of scorn 
 upon thy side , against my self i 'll fight 
 and prove thee virtuous , though thou art forsworn 
 with mine own weakness being best acquainted 
 upon thy part i can set down a story 
 of faults concealed , wherein i am attainted 
 that thou in losing me , shalt win much glory 
 and i by this will be a gainer too 
 for bending all my loving thoughts on thee 
 the injuries that to my self i do 
 doing thee vantage , double vantage me 
 such is my love , to thee i so belong 
 that for thy right , my self will bear all wrong 

hark to the sound that speedeth o'er the land 
 behold the sword in fratricidal hand 
 ‘ tis duty calls thee , lincoln , and thy trust 
 demands that all thy acts be wise and just 
 no idle task to thee has been assigned 
 but work that 's worthy of a giant mind 
 and on the issue hangs the nation 's fame 
 as a free people who deserve the name 
 so , walk thou in the way the fathers trod 
 be true to freedom , country , and to god 
 then truth will triumph , treason be undone 
 and thou be hailed the second washington 
 the first , the father of his country — thou 
 its saviour . bind the laurel on thy brow 

another that he may his joys secure 
 turns limbetham and keep some gaudy whore 
 thinks her his own — when satan knows her his mind 
 is like her body not to be confin 'd 
 as constant as the moon , she plays her part 
 and like a viper preys upon his heart 
 draws him so poor , till like her slaves 
 which she bestows on some smart fop she loves 
 for this is with ‘ em a perpetual rule 
 they never love the person that they fool 
 this he perceives not till it is too late 
 till ruined in his person and estate 
 and then good night , when all his money 's gone 
 miss leaves him too , to ply about the town 

if in the spirit glows no spark divine 
 if soulless dust return to dust again 
 if , after life , but death and dark remain 
 then it were well to make the moment thine 
 bacchante steeping soul and sense in wine 
 in lotus lulling languors , fond desires 
 that heat the heart with fierce , unhallowed fires 
 till pleasure , circe like , transform us into swine 
 but if some subtler spirit thrill our clay 
 some god like flame illume this fleeting dust 
 promethean fire snatched from the olympian height 
 then must we choose the nobler , higher way 
 seeking the beautiful , the pure , the just 
 the ultimate crowned triumph of the right 

i thank all who have loved me in their hearts 
 with thanks and love from mine . deep thanks to all 
 who paused a little near the prison wall 
 to hear my music in its louder parts 
 ere they went onward , each one to the mart 's 
 or temple 's occupation , beyond call 
 but thou , who , in my voice 's sink and fall 
 when the sob took it , thy divinest art 's 
 own instrument didst drop down at thy foot 
 to harken what i said between my tears 
 instruct me how to thank thee ! oh , to shoot 
 my soul 's full meaning into future years 
 that they should lend it utterance , and salute 
 love that endures , from life that disappears 

among the taller wood with ivy hung 
 the old fox plays and dances round her young 
 she snuffs and barks if any passes bye 
 and swings her tail and turns prepared to fly 
 the horseman hurries bye , she bolts to see 
 and turns agen , from danger never free 
 if any stands she runs among the poles 
 and barks and snaps and drives them in the holes 
 the shepherd sees them and the boy goes bye 
 and gets a stick and progs the hole to try 
 they get all still and lie in safety sure 
 and out again when every thing 's secure 
 and start and snap at blackbirds bouncing bye 
 to fight and catch the great white butterfly 

restore thy tresses to the golden ore 
 yield cytherea 's son those arks of love 
 bequeath the heavens the stars that i adore 
 and to the orient do thy pearls remove 
 yield thy hands ’ pride unto the ivory white 
 t'arabian odours give thy breathing sweet 
 restore thy blush unto aurora bright 
 to thetis give the honour of thy feet 
 let venus have the graces she resigned 
 and thy sweet voice give back unto the spheres 
 but yet restore thy fierce and cruel mind 
 to hyrcan tigers and to ruthless bears 
 yield to the marble thy hard heart again 
 so shalt thou cease to plague , and i to pain 

whilst his redeemer on his canvass dies 
 stabb ’ d at his feet his brother weltering lies 
 the daring artist , cruelly serene 
 views the pale cheek and the distorted mien 
 he drains off life by drops , and , deaf to cries 
 examines every spirit as it flies 
 he studies torment , dives in mortal woe 
 to rouse up every pang repeats his blow 
 each rising agony , each dreadful grace 
 yet warm transplanting to his saviour ’ s face 
 oh glorious theft ! oh nobly wicked draught 
 with its full charge of death each feature fraught 
 such wondrous force the magic colours boast 
 from his own skill he starts in horror lost 

our land — our home — the common home indeed 
 of soil born children and adopted ones 
 the stately daughters and the stalwart sons 
 of industry —: all greeting and godspeed 
 o home to proudly live for , and if need 
 be proudly die for , with the roar of guns 
 blent with our latest prayer —. so died men once 
 lo peace ...! as we look on the land they freed 
 its harvests all in ocean over flow 
 poured round autumnal coasts in billowy gold 
 its corn and wine and balmed fruits and flow'rs 
 we know the exaltation that they know 
 who now , steadfast inheritors , behold 
 the land elysian , marvelling “ this is ours 

mine eye and heart are at a mortal war 
 how to divide the conquest of thy sight 
 mine eye , my heart thy picture 's sight would bar 
 my heart , mine eye the freedom of that right 
 my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie 
 ( a closet never pierced with crystal eyes 
 but the defendant doth that plea deny 
 and says in him thy fair appearance lies 
 to side this title is impanelled 
 a quest of thoughts , all tenants to the heart 
 and by their verdict is determined 
 the clear eye 's moiety , and the dear heart 's part 
 as thus , mine eye 's due is thy outward part 
 and my heart 's right , thy inward love of heart 

oft when my spirit doth spred her bolder winges 
 in mind to mount up to the purest sky 
 it down is weighd with thought of earthly things 
 and clogd with burden of mortality 
 where , when that soverayne beauty it doth spy 
 resembling heavens glory in her light 
 drawn with sweet pleasures bayt it back doth fly 
 and unto heaven forgets her former flight 
 there my fraile fancy , fed with full delight 
 doth bathe in blisse , and mantlcth most at ease 
 ne thinks of other heaven , but how it might 
 her harts desire with most contentment please 
 hart need not wish none other happinesse 
 but here on earth to have such hevens blisse 

our love is not a fading , earthly flower 
 its wing è d seed dropped down from paradise 
 and , nursed by day and night , by sun and shower 
 doth momently to fresher beauty rise 
 to us the leafless autumn is not bare 
 nor winter 's rattling boughs lack lusty green 
 our summer hearts make summer 's fulness , where 
 no leaf , or bud , or blossom may be seen 
 for nature 's life in love 's deep life doth lie 
 love ,— whose forgetfulness is beauty 's death 
 whose mystic key these cells of thou and i 
 into the infinite freedom openeth 
 and makes the body 's dark and narrow grate 
 the wide flung leaves of heaven 's own palace gate 

what wonder strikes the curious , while he views 
 the black ant 's city , by a rotten tree 
 or woodland bank ! in ignorance we muse 
 pausing , annoyed ,— we know not what we see 
 such government and thought there seem to be 
 some looking on , and urging some to toil 
 dragging their loads of bent stalks slavishly 
 and what 's more wonderful , when big loads foil 
 one ant or two to carry , quickly then 
 a swarm flock round to help their fellow men 
 surely they speak a language whisperingly 
 too fine for us to hear ; and sure their ways 
 prove they have kings and laws , and that they be 
 deformed remnants of the fairy days 

but when we asked you where you 'd been 
 complained of loneliness and hunger , spoke of children 
 who lived in order , sat down thrice a day 
 to cream and porridge , bread and meat 
 we think to corner you — alas for us 
 your anger flashes swords ! reasons pour out 
 like anvil sparks to justify your way 
 “ your father 's always gone — you selfish children 
 you 'd have me in the house from morn till night 
 you put us in the wrong — our cause is routed 
 we turn to bed unsatisfied in mind 
 you 've overwhelmed us , not convinced us 
 our sense of wrong defeat breeds resolution 
 to whip you out when minds grow strong 

as due by many titles , i resign 
 myself to thee , o god ! first i was made 
 by thee , and for thee ; and when i was decayed 
 thy blood bought that , the which before was thine 
 i am thy son , made with thyself to shine 
 thy servant , whose pains thou hast still repaid 
 thy sheep , thine image ; and , till i betrayed 
 myself , a temple of thy spirit divine 
 why doth the devil then usurp on me 
 why doth he steal , nay , ravish , that 's thy right 
 except thou rise , and for thine own work fight 
 oh ! i shall soon despair , when i shall see 
 that thou lov'st mankind well , yet wilt not choose me 
 and satan hates me , yet is loth to lose me 

lo as a careful huswife runs to catch 
 one of her feathered creatures broke away 
 sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch 
 in pursuit of the thing she would have stay 
 whilst her neglected child holds her in chase 
 cries to catch her whose busy care is bent 
 to follow that which flies before her face 
 not prizing her poor infant 's discontent 
 so run'st thou after that which flies from thee 
 whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind 
 but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me 
 and play the mother 's part , kiss me , be kind 
 so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will 
 if thou turn back and my loud crying still 

upon a rock , high on a mountain side 
 thousands of feet above the lake sea 's lip 
 a rock in which old waters ’ rise and dip 
 plunge and recoil , and backward eddying tide 
 had , age long , worn , while races lived and died 
 involved channels , where the sea weed 's drip 
 followed the ebb ; and now earth grasses sip 
 fresh dews from heaven , whereby on earth they bide 
 i sat and gazed southwards . a dry flow 
 of withering wind blew on my drooping strength 
 from o'er the awful desert 's burning length 
 behind me piled , away and upward go 
 great sweeps of savage mountains — up , away 
 where panthers roam , and snow gleams all the day 

“ beloved vale ! ” i said , “ when i shall con 
 those many records of my childish years 
 remembrance of myself and of my peers 
 will press me down : to think of what is gone 
 will be an awful thought , if life have one 
 but , when into the vale i came , no fears 
 distress 'd me ; i look 'd round , i shed no tears 
 deep thought , or awful vision , i had none 
 by thousand petty fancies i was cross 'd 
 to see the trees , which i had thought so tall 
 mere dwarfs ; the brooks so narrow , fields so small 
 a juggler 's balls old time about him toss 'd 
 i looked , i stared , i smiled , i laughed ; and all 
 the weight of sadness was in wonder lost 

i grant thou wert not married to my muse 
 and therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook 
 the dedicated words which writers use 
 of their fair subject , blessing every book 
 thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue 
 finding thy worth a limit past my praise 
 and therefore art enforced to seek anew 
 some fresher stamp of the time bettering days 
 and do so love , yet when they have devised 
 what strained touches rhetoric can lend 
 thou truly fair , wert truly sympathized 
 in true plain words , by thy true telling friend 
 and their gross painting might be better used 
 where cheeks need blood , in thee it is abused 

dares he behold the thing he is , what thing 
 he would become is in his mind its child 
 astir , demanding birth to light and wing 
 for battle prompt , by pleasure unbeguiled 
 so moves he forth in faith , if he has made 
 his mind god 's temple , dedicate to truth 
 earth 's nourishing delights , no more gainsaid 
 he tastes , as doth the bridegroom rich in youth 
 then knows he love , that beckons and controls 
 the star of sky upon his footway cast 
 then match in him who holds his tempters fast 
 the body 's love and mind 's , whereof the soul 's 
 then earth her man for woman finds at last 
 to speed the pair unto her goal of goals 

earth has not anything to show more fair 
 dull would be he of soul who could pass by 
 a sight so touching in its majesty 
 this city now doth , like a garment , wear 
 the beauty of the morning ; silent , bare 
 ships , towers , domes , theatres , and temples lie 
 open unto the fields , and to the sky 
 all bright and glittering in the smokeless air 
 never did sun more beautifully steep 
 in his first splendour , valley , rock , or hill 
 ne'er saw i , never felt , a calm so deep 
 the river glideth at his own sweet will 
 dear god ! the very houses seem asleep 
 and all that mighty heart is lying still 

their course had hardly run three other days 
 when fair aminta , studious still of ways 
 to have her wish , again to alice came 
 to give dear cleon notice of her flame 
 my home , cried she , ‘ tis requisite i leave 
 to ruin me , your cousin , i perceive 
 is still resolved , for presents now he sends 
 but he mistakes , and blindly wealth expends 
 i 'm clearly not the woman he suspects 
 see here , what jewels rare to please the sex 
 nice rubies , diamonds too , but what is more 
 my portrait i have found among the store 
 which must have been from memory designed 
 since only with my husband that you 'll find 

beneath thy midas touch life 's sullen grays 
 are thrilled to sudden gold ; as some far gleam 
 from wings of helios athwart thy dream 
 irradiates for thee earth 's darksome ways 
 wild woodland voices ripple thro ’ thy lays 
 sweet silvern murmurs from some deep delled spring 
 brook , tree and flower and each insensate thing 
 the throstle 's call , the calm of sun steeped days 
 a glint of sunshine on the swallow 's wing 
 fern filagrees , the drowsy drone of bee 
 made drunk with draughts of purple wild grape wine 
 all these orph è an music holds for thee 
 and all thy days and dreams companioning 
 walks nature with her hand close clasped in thine 

o words of all my songs . . . black butterflies 
 wild words of all the wayward songs i sing 
 called from the tomb of some enchanted past 
 by that strange sphinx , my soul , they slowly rise 
 and settle on white pages wing to wing 
 white pages like flower petals fluttering 
 held spellbound there till some blind hour shall bring 
 the perfect voice that , delicate and wise 
 shall set them free in fairyland at last 
 that garden of all dreams and ecstasies 
 where my soul sings through an eternal spring 
 watching alone with enigmatic eyes 
 dark wings on pale flower petals quivering 
 o words of all my songs . . . black butterflies 

at midnight when the moonlit cypress trees 
 have woven round his grave a magic shade 
 still weeping the unfinished hymn he made 
 there moves fresh maia like a morning breeze 
 blown over jonquil beds when warm rains cease 
 and stooping where her poet 's head is laid 
 selene weeps while all the tides are stayed 
 and swaying seas are darkened into peace 
 but they who wake the meadows and the tides 
 have hearts too kind to bid him wake from sleep 
 who murmurs sometimes when his dreams are deep 
 startling the quiet land where he abides 
 and charming still , sad eyed persephone 
 with visions of the sunny earth and sea 

hide this one night thy crescent , kindly moon 
 so shall endymion faithful prove , and rest 
 loving and unawakened on thy breast 
 so shall no foul enchanter importune 
 thy quiet course ; for now the night is boon 
 and through the friendly night unseen i fare 
 who dread the face of foemen unaware 
 and watch of hostile spies in the bright noon 
 thou knowest , moon , the bitter power of love 
 ‘ tis told how shepherd pan found ways to move 
 for little price , thy heart ; and of your grace 
 sweet stars , be kind to this not alien fire 
 because on earth ye did not scorn desire 
 bethink ye , now ye hold your heavenly place 

seeker of truth !— long hast thou striven to find 
 this only boon that satisfies the mind 
 through nature 's stores the treasure hast thou sought 
 hast traversed all the boundless fields of thought 
 questioned the lonely night , the laughing day 
 the ocean depths , the founts that ceaseless play 
 old hoary mountains , cliffs , and caverns lone 
 earth 's secret depths — mysterious , unknown 
 asked of the past , the present , future , striven 
 to pierce the mysteries unrevealed of heaven 
 yet weary and unsatisfied remained 
 longing for truth , still far off , unattained 
 that truth which satisfies the anxious quest 
 and with the attainment , bringeth perfect rest 

her courts are by the flux of flaming ways 
 between the rivers and the illumined sky 
 whose fervid depths reverberate from on high 
 fierce lustres mingled in a fiery haze 
 they mark it inland ; blithe and fair of face 
 her suitors follow , guessing by the glare 
 beyond the hilltops in the evening air 
 how bright the cressets at her portals blaze 
 on the pure fronts defeat ere many a day 
 falls like the soot and dirt on city snow 
 there hopes deferred lie sunk in piteous seams 
 her paths are disillusion and decay 
 with ruins piled and unapparent woe 
 the graves of beauty and the wreck of dreams 

o ye , who dwell in youth 's inviting bowers 
 waste not , in useless joy , your fleeting hours 
 but rather let the tears of sorrow roll 
 and sad reflection fill the conscious soul 
 for many a jocund spring has passed away 
 and many a flower has blossomed , to decay 
 and human life , still hastening to a close 
 finds in the worthless dust its last repose 
 still the vain world abounds in strife and hate 
 and sire and son provoke each other 's fate 
 and kindred blood by kindred hands is shed 
 and vengeance sleeps not — dies not , with the dead 
 all nature fades — the garden 's treasures fall 
 young bud , and citron ripe — all perish , all 

this bronze doth keep the very form and mold 
 of our great martyr 's face . yes , this is he 
 that brow all wisdom , all benignity 
 that human , humorous mouth ; those cheeks that hold 
 like some harsh landscape all the summer 's gold 
 that spirit fit for sorrow , as the sea 
 for storms to beat on ; the lone agony 
 those silent , patient lips too well foretold 
 yes , this is he who ruled a world of men 
 as might some prophet of the elder day 
 brooding above the tempest and the fray 
 with deep eyed thought and more than mortal ken 
 a power was his beyond the touch of art 
 or arm è d strength : his pure and mighty heart 

to garryowen upon an organ ground 
 two girls are jigging . riotously they trip 
 with eyes aflame , quick bosoms , hand on hip 
 as in the tumult of a witches ’ round 
 youngsters and youngsters round them prance and bound 
 two solemn babes twirl ponderously , and skip 
 the artist 's teeth gleam from his bearded lip 
 high from the kennel howls a tortured hound 
 the music reels and hurtles , and the night 
 is full of stinks and cries ; a naphtha light 
 flares from a barrow ; battered and obtused 
 with vices , wrinkles , life and work and rags 
 each with her inch of clay , two loitering hags 
 look on dispassionate — critical — something ‘ mused 

shall the hag evil die with the child of good 
 or propagate again her loath è d kind 
 thronging the cells of the diseased mind 
 hateful with hanging cheeks , a withered brood 
 though hourly pastured on the salient blood 
 oh ! that the wind which bloweth cold or heat 
 would shatter and o'erbear the brazen beat 
 of their broad vans , and in the solitude 
 of middle space confound them , and blow back 
 their wild cries down their cavernthroats , and slake 
 with points of blastborne hail their heated eyne 
 so their wan limbs no more might come between 
 the moon and the moon 's reflex in the night 
 nor blot with floating shades the solar light 

queen regnant she , and so shall be for aye

like a beautiful face looking ever at me 
 a pure bright moon cometh over the sea 
 and i stand on the crags , and hear the falls 
 go tumbling down , through the black river walls 
 and the heart of the gorge is rent with the cry 
 of the pent up winds in their agony 
 you are far from me , dear , where i watch and wait 
 like a weary bird for a long lost mate 
 and my life is as dull as the sluggish stream 
 feeling its way through a world of dream 
 for here is a waste of darkness and fear 
 and i call and i call , but no one will hear 
 o darling of mine , do you ever yearn 
 for a something lost , which will never return 

“ no drop shall touch me , by almighty jove

 and share your feast ; but with the dawn of day

 and bid the forests fall : ( such rites are paid 
 to heroes slumbering in eternal shade

the chief of lara is returned again 
 and why had lara crossed the bounding main 
 left by his sire , too young such loss to know 
 lord of himself ,— that heritage of woe 
 that fearful empire which the human breast 
 but holds to rob the heart within of rest 
 with none to check , and few to point in time 
 the thousand paths that slope the way to crime

 yet who knows not conscience is born of love

it is not to be thought of that the flood 
 of british freedom , which , to the open sea 
 of the world 's praise , from dark antiquity 
 hath flowed , ‘ with pomp of waters , unwithstood 
 roused though it be full often to a mood 
 which spurns the check of salutary bands 
 that this most famous stream in bogs and sands 
 should perish ; and to evil and to good 
 be lost for ever . in our halls is hung 
 armoury of the invincible knights of old

on many a saddened hearth the evening fire 
 burns paler as the children 's hour draws near 
 that joyous hour his song made doubly dear 
 and tender memories touch the faltering choir 
 he sings no more on earth ; our vain desire 
 aches for the voice we loved so long to hear 
 in dorian flute notes breathing soft and clear 
 the sweet contralto that could never tire 
 deafened with listening to a harsher strain 
 the maenad 's scream , the stark barbarian 's cry 
 still for those soothing , loving tones we sigh 
 oh , for our vanished orpheus once again 
 the shadowy silence hears us call in vain 
 his lips are hushed ; his song shall never die

 and rested at the foot of those wild hills 
 the rugged founts of the per æ an rills 
 and of that other ridge whose barren back 
 stretches , with all its mist and cloudy rack 
 south westward to cleone . there she stood 
 about a young bird 's flutter from a wood 
 fair , on a sloping green of mossy tread 
 by a clear pool , wherein she passioned 
 to see herself escap 'd from so sore ills 
 while her robes flaunted with the daffodils 

let those who are in favour with their stars 
 of public honour and proud titles boast 
 whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars 
 unlooked for joy in that i honour most 
 great princes ’ favourites their fair leaves spread 
 but as the marigold at the sun 's eye 
 and in themselves their pride lies buried 
 for at a frown they in their glory die 
 the painful warrior famoused for fight 
 after a thousand victories once foiled 
 is from the book of honour razed quite 
 and all the rest forgot for which he toiled 
 then happy i that love and am beloved 
 where i may not remove nor be removed 

o melancholy bird , a winter 's day 
 thou standest by the margin of the pool 
 and , taught by god , dost thy whole being school 
 to patience , which all evil can allay 
 god has appointed thee the fish thy prey 
 and given thyself a lesson to the fool 
 unthrifty , to submit to moral rule 
 and his unthinking course by thee to weigh 
 there need not schools , nor the professor 's chair 
 though these be good , true wisdom to impart 
 he , who has not enough for these to spare 
 of time , or gold , may yet amend his heart 
 and teach his soul , by brooks and rivers fair 
 nature is always wise in every part 

when comes the lighted day for men to read 
 life 's meaning , with the work before their hands 
 till this good gift of breath from debt is freed 
 earth will not hear her children 's wailful bands 
 deplore the chieftain fall'n in sob and dirge 
 nor they look where is darkness , but on high 
 the sun that dropped down our horizon 's verge 
 illumes his labours through the travelled sky 
 now seen in sum , most glorious ; and ‘ tis known 
 by what our warrior wrought we hold him fast 
 a splendid image built of man has flown 
 his deeds inspired of god outstep a past 
 ours the great privilege to have had one 
 among us who celestial tasks has done 

the marvel of the ne'er familiar day 
 sacred investiture of life renewed 
 the chrism of dew , the coronal of flame 
 low in the valley lies the conquered rout 
 of man 's poor , trivial turmoil , lost and drowned 
 under the mist , in gleaming rivers rolled 
 where oozy marsh contends with frothing main 
 and rounding all , springs one full , ambient arch 
 one great good limpid world — so still , so still 
 for no sound echoes from its crystal curve 
 save four clear notes , the song of that lone bird 
 who , brave but trembling , tries his morning hymn 
 and has no heart to finish , for the awe 
 and wonder of this pearling globe of dawn 

i stood upon the stone where ela lay 
 the widowed founder of these ancient walls 
 where fancy still on meek devotion calls 
 marking the ivied arch , and turret gray 
 for her soul 's rest — eternal rest — to pray 
 where visionary nuns yet seem to tread 
 a pale dim troop , the cloisters of the dead 
 though twice three hundred years have flown away 
 but when , with silent step and pensive mien 
 in weeds , as mourning for her sisters gone 
 the mistress of this lone monastic scene 
 came ; and i heard her voice 's tender tone 
 i said , though centuries have rolled between 
 one gentle , beauteous nun is left , on earth , alone 

my hope and heart is with thee — thou wilt be 
 a latter luther , and a soldier priest 
 to scare church harpies from the master 's feast 
 our dusted velvets have much need of thee 
 thou art no sabbath drawler of old saws 
 distill 'd from some worm canker 'd homily 
 but spurr 'd at heart with fieriest energy 
 to embattail and to wall about thy cause 
 with iron worded proof , hating to hark 
 the humming of the drowsy pulpit drone 
 half god 's good sabbath , while the worn out clerk 
 brow beats his desk below . thou from a throne 
 mounted in heaven wilt shoot into the dark 
 arrows of lightnings . i will stand and mark 

i thought our love at full , but i did err 
 joy 's wreath drooped o'er mine eyes ; i could not see 
 that sorrow in our happy world must be 
 love 's deepest spokesman and interpreter 
 but , as a mother feels her child first stir 
 under her heart , so felt i instantly 
 deep in my soul another bond to thee 
 thrill with that life we saw depart from her 
 o mother of our angel child ! twice dear 
 death knits as well as parts , and still , i wis 
 her tender radiance shall infold us here 
 even as the light , borne up by inward bliss 
 threads the void glooms of space without a fear 
 to print on farthest stars her pitying kiss 

thou canst not die whilst any zeal abound 
 in feeling hearts than can conceive these lines 
 though thou a laura hast no petrarch found 
 in base attire yet clearly beauty shines 
 and i though born within a colder clime 
 do feel mine inward heat as great — i know it 
 he never had more faith , although more rhyme 
 i love as well though he could better show it 
 but i may add one feather to thy fame 
 to help her flight throughout the fairest isle 
 and if my pen could more enlarge thy name 
 then shouldst thou live in an immortal style 
 for though that laura better limn è d be 
 suffice , thou shalt be loved as well as she 

pardon , oh , pardon , that my soul should make 
 of all that strong divineness which i know 
 for thine and thee , an image only so 
 formed of the sand , and fit to shift and break 
 it is that distant years which did not take 
 thy sovranty , recoiling with a blow 
 have forced my swimming brain to undergo 
 their doubt and dread , and blindly to forsake 
 thy purity of likeness and distort 
 thy worthiest love to a worthless counterfeit 
 as if a shipwrecked pagan , safe in port 
 his guardian sea god to commemorate 
 should set a sculptured porpoise , gills a snort 
 and vibrant tail , within the temple gate 

an angel spoke with me , and lo , he hoarded 
 my falling tears to cheer a flower 's face 
 for , so it seems , in all the heavenly space 
 a wasted grief was never yet recorded 
 victorious calm those holy tones afforded 
 unto my soul , whose outcry , in disgrace 
 changed to low music , leading to the place 
 where , though well armed , with futile end awarded 
 my past lay dead . “ wars are of earth ! ” he cried 
 “ endurance only breathes immortal air 
 courage eternal , by a world defied 
 still wears the front of patience , smooth and fair 
 are wars so futile , and is courage peace 
 take , then , my soul , thus gently thy release 

calm is all nature as a resting wheel 
 the kine are couch 'd upon the dewy grass 
 the horse alone , seen dimly as i pass 
 is up , and cropping yet his later meal 
 dark is the ground ; a slumber seems to steal 
 o'er vale , and mountain , and the starless sky 
 now , in this blank of things , a harmony 
 home felt , and home created seems to heal 
 that grief for which the senses still supply 
 fresh food ; for only then , when memory 
 is hush 'd , am i at rest . my friends , restrain 
 those busy cares that would allay my pain 
 oh ! leave me to myself ; nor let me feel 
 the officious touch that makes me droop again 

he faced his canvas ( as a seer whose ken 
 pierces the crust of this existence through 
 and smiled beyond on that his genius knew 
 ere mated with his being . conscious then 
 of his high theme alone , he smiled again 
 straight back upon himself in many a hue 
 and tint , and light and shade , which slowly grew 
 enfeatured of a fair girl 's face , as when 
 first time she smiles for love 's sake with no fear 
 so wrought he , witless that behind him leant 
 a woman , with old features , dim and sear 
 and glamoured eyes that felt the brimming tear 
 and with a voice , like some sad instrument 
 that sighing said , “ i 'm dead there ; love me here 

then while eurynome the mandate bears 
 from heaven minerva shoots with guardian cares 
 o'er all her senses , as the couch she press 'd 
 she pours , a pleasing , deep and death like rest 
 with every beauty every feature arms 
 bids her cheeks glow , and lights up all her charms 
 in her love darting eyes awakes the fires 
 ( immortal gifts ! to kindle soft desires 
 from limb to limb an air majestic sheds 
 and the pure ivory o'er her bosom spreads 
 such venus shines , when with a measured bound 
 she smoothly gliding swims the harmonious round 
 when with the graces in the dance she moves 
 and fires the gazing gods with ardent loves 

oh , modest maiden morn ! why dost thou blush 
 who thus betimes art walking in the sky 
 ‘ tis i , whose cheek bears pleasure 's sleepless flush 
 who shame to meet thy gray , cloud lidded eye 
 shadowy , yet clear : from the bright eastern door 
 where the sun 's shafts lie bound with thongs of fire 
 along the heaven 's amber paved floor 
 the glad hours move , hymning their early choir 
 o , fair and fragrant morn ! upon my brow 
 press thy fresh lips , shake from thy dropping hair 
 cold showers of balmy dew on me , and ere 
 day 's chariot wheels upon th ’ horizon glow 
 wrap me within thy sober cloak of gray 
 and bear me to thy twilight bowers away 

o star of morning and of liberty 
 o bringer of the light , whose splendor shines 
 above the darkness of the apennines 
 forerunner of the day that is to be 
 the voices of the city and the sea 
 the voices of the mountains and the pines 
 repeat thy song , till the familiar lines 
 are footpaths for the thought of italy 
 thy fame is blown abroad from all the heights 
 through all the nations , and a sound is heard 
 as of a mighty wind , and men devout 
 strangers of rome , and the new proselytes 
 in their own language hear thy wondrous word 
 and many are amazed and many doubt 

‘ flow from the rock , my flax ! and swiftly flow 
 pursue thy thread , the spindle runs below 
 a creature fond and changing , fair and vain 
 the creature woman , rises now to reign 
 new beauty blooms , a beauty form 'd to fly 
 new love begins , a love produced to die 
 new parts distress the troubled scenes of life 
 the fondling mistress , and the ruling wife 
 men , born to labour , all with pains provide 
 women have time to sacrifice to pride 
 they want the care of man , their want they know 
 and dress to please with heart alluring show 
 the show prevailing , for the sway contend 
 and make a servant where they meet a friend 

thou poetess ! that harpest to the moon 
 and , in soft concert to the silver tune 
 of waters , play 'd on by the magic wind 
 as he comes streaming , with his hair untwined 
 dost sing light strains of melody and mirth 
 i hear thee , hymning on thy holy birth 
 how thou wert moulded of thy mother love 
 that came , like seraph , from the stars above 
 and was so sadly wedded unto sin 
 that thou wert born , and sorrow was thy twin 
 sorrow and mirthful lunacy ! that be 
 together link 'd for time , i deem of ye 
 that ye are worshipp 'd as none others are 
 one as a lonely shadow , one a star 

how long shall this lyke dying lyfe endure 
 and know no end of her owne mysery 
 but wast and weare away in termes unsure 
 ‘ twixt feare and hope depending doubtfully 
 yet better were attonce to let me die 
 and shew the last ensample of your pride 
 then to torment me thus with cruelty 
 to prove your powre , which i too wel have tride 
 but yet if in your hardned brest ye bide 
 a close intent at last to shew me grace 
 then all the woes and wrecks which i abide 
 as meanes of blisse i gladly wil embrace 
 and wish that more and greater they might be 
 that greater meede at last may turne to mee 

go from me . yet i feel that i shall stand 
 henceforward in thy shadow . nevermore 
 alone upon the threshold of my door 
 of individual life , i shall command 
 the uses of my soul , nor lift my hand 
 serenely in the sunshine as before 
 without the sense of that which i forbore 
 thy touch upon the palm . the widest land 
 doom takes to part us , leaves thy heart in mine 
 with pulses that beat double . what i do 
 and what i dream include thee , as the wine 
 must taste of its own grapes . and when i sue 
 god for myself , he hears that name of thine 
 and sees within my eyes the tears of two 

thy satin vesture richer is than looms 
 of orient weave for raiment of her kings 
 not dyes of olden tyre , not precious things 
 regathered from the long forgotten tombs 
 of buried empires , not the iris plumes 
 that wave upon the tropics ’ myriad wings 
 not all proud sheba 's queenly offerings 
 could match the golden marvel of thy blooms 
 for thou art nurtured from the treasure veins 
 of this fair land ; thy golden rootlets sup 
 her sands of gold — of gold thy petals spun 
 her golden glory , thou ! of hills and plains 
 lifting , exultant , every kingly cup 
 brimmed with the golden vintage of the sun 

lord of my love , to whom in vassalage 
 thy merit hath my duty strongly knit 
 to thee i send this written embassage 
 to witness duty , not to show my wit 
 duty so great , which wit so poor as mine 
 may make seem bare , in wanting words to show it 
 but that i hope some good conceit of thine 
 in thy soul 's thought ( all naked ) will bestow it 
 till whatsoever star that guides my moving 
 points on me graciously with fair aspect 
 and puts apparel on my tattered loving 
 to show me worthy of thy sweet respect 
 then may i dare to boast how i do love thee 
 till then , not show my head where thou mayst prove me 

night is the true democracy . when day 
 like some great monarch with his train has passed 
 in regal pomp and splendor to the last 
 the stars troop forth along the milky way 
 a jostling crowd , in radiant disarray 
 on heaven 's broad boulevard in pageants vast 
 and things of earth , the hunted and outcast 
 come from their haunts and hiding places ; yea 
 even from the nooks and crannies of the mind 
 visions uncouth and vagrant fancies start 
 and specters of dead joy , that shun the light 
 and impotent regrets and terrors blind 
 each one , in form grotesque , playing its part 
 in the fantastic mardi gras of night 

i say unto all hearts that cannot rest 
 for want of love , for beating loud and lonely 
 pray the great mercy god to give you only 
 love that is passionless within the breast 
 pray that it may not be a haunting fire 
 a vision that shall steal insatiably 
 all beauteous content , all sweet desire 
 from faith and dream , star , flower , and song , and sea 
 but seek that soul and soul may meet together 
 knowing they have forever been but one 
 meet and be surest when ill 's chartless weather 
 drives blinding gales of doubt across their sun 
 pray — pray ! lost love uptorn shall seem as nether 
 hell hate and rage beyond oblivion 

if thy soul check thee that i come so near 
 swear to thy blind soul that i was thy ‘ will 
 and will thy soul knows is admitted there 
 thus far for love , my love suit sweet fulfil 
 ‘ will ’ , will fulfil the treasure of thy love 
 ay , fill it full with wills , and my will one 
 in things of great receipt with case we prove 
 among a number one is reckoned none 
 then in the number let me pass untold 
 though in thy store 's account i one must be 
 for nothing hold me , so it please thee hold 
 that nothing me , a something sweet to thee 
 make but my name thy love , and love that still 
 and then thou lov'st me for my name is will 

“ not without purpose once more to return 
 thou find'st me , my casella , where i am 
 journeying this way ; ” i said , “ but how of thee 
 hath so much time been lost ? ” he answer 'd straight 
 “ no outrage hath been done to me , if he 
 who when and whom he chooses takes , me oft 
 this passage hath denied , since of just will 
 his will he makes . these three months past indeed 
 he , whose chose to enter , with free leave 
 hath taken ; whence i wand'ring by the shore 
 where tyber 's wave grows salt , of him gain 'd kind 
 admittance , at that river 's mouth , tow'rd which 
 his wings are pointed , for there always throng 
 all such as not to archeron descend 

how blest is he who knows no meaner strife 
 than art 's long battle with the foes of life 
 no doubt assails him , doing still his best 
 and trusting kindly nature for the rest 
 no mocking conscience tears the thin disguise 
 that wraps his breast , and tells him that he lies 
 he comes : the languid sufferer lifts his head 
 and smiles a welcome from his weary bed 
 he speaks : what music like the tones that tell 
 “ past is the hour of danger ,— all is well 
 how can he feel the petty stings of grief 
 whose cheering presence always brings relief 
 what ugly dreams can trouble his repose 
 who yields himself to soothe another 's woes 

chaos , of old , was god 's dominion 
 ‘ twas his belov è d child , his own first born 
 and he was ag è d ere the thought of morn 
 shook the sheer steeps of black oblivion 
 then all the works of darkness being done 
 through countless æ ons hopelessly forlorn 
 out to the very utmost verge and bourn 
 god at the last , reluctant , made the sun 
 he loved his darkness still , for it was old 
 he grieved to see his eldest child take flight 
 and when his fiat lux the death knell tolled 
 as the doomed darkness backward by him rolled 
 he snatched a remnant flying into light 
 and strewed it with the stars , and called it night 

as by the west wind driv'n , the ocean waves 
 dash forward on the far resounding shore 
 wave upon wave ; first curls the ruffled sea 
 with whit'ning crests ; anon with thund'ring roar 
 it breaks upon the beach , and from the crags 
 recoiling flings in giant curves its head 
 aloft , and tosses high the wild sea spray 
 column on column , so the hosts of greece 
 pour 'd , ceaseless , to the war ; to each the chiefs 
 their orders gave ; the rest in silence mov 'd 
 nor would ye deem that mighty mass endued 
 with power of speech , so silently they moved 
 in awe of their great captains : far around 
 flashed the bright armour they were girt withal 

love hath i followed all too long , nought gaining 
 and sighed i have in vain to sweet what smarteth 
 but from his brow a fiery arrow parteth 
 thinking that i should him resist not plaining 
 but cowardly my heart submiss remaining 
 yields to receive what shaft thy fair eye darteth 
 well do i see thine eye my bale imparteth 
 and that save death no hope i am detaining 
 for what is he can alter fortune 's sliding 
 one in his bed consumes his life away 
 other in wars , another in the sea 
 the like effects in me have their abiding 
 for heavens avowed my fortune should be such 
 that i should die by loving far too much 

soon as the prince appears without the gate 
 the volscians , with their virgin leader , wait 
 his last commands . then , with a graceful mien 
 lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen 
 her squadron imitates , and each descends 
 whose common suit camilla thus commends 
 “ if sense of honor , if a soul secure 
 of inborn worth , that can all tests endure 
 can promise aught , or on itself rely 
 greatly to dare , to conquer or to die 
 then , i alone , sustain 'd by these , will meet 
 the tyrrhene troops , and promise their defeat 
 ours be the danger , ours the sole renown 
 you , gen'ral , stay behind , and guard the town 

to know thee is all wisdom , and old age 
 is but to know thee : dimly we behold thee 
 athwart the veils of evil which enfold thee 
 we beat upon our aching hearts with rage 
 we cry for thee : we deem the world thy tomb 
 as dwellers in lone planets look upon 
 the mighty disk of their majestic sun 
 hallowed in awful chasms of wheeling gloom 
 making their day dim , so we gaze on thee 
 come , thou of many crowns , white rob è d love 
 oh ! rend the veil in twain : all men adore thee 
 heaven crieth after thee ; earth waileth for thee 
 breathe on thy wing è d throne , and it shall move 
 in music and in light o'er land and sea 

i lift mine eyes , and all the windows blaze 
 with forms of saints and holy men who died 
 here martyred and hereafter glorified 
 and the great rose upon its leaves displays 
 christ 's triumph , and the angelic roundelays 
 with splendor upon splendor multiplied 
 and beatrice again at dante 's side 
 no more rebukes , but smiles her words of praise 
 and then the organ sounds , and unseen choirs 
 sing the old latin hymns of peace and love 
 and benedictions of the holy ghost 
 and the melodious bells among the spires 
 o'er all the house tops and through heaven above 
 proclaim the elevation of the host 

xii . “ pellucid forms ! whose crystal bosoms show 
 the shine of welfare , or the shade of woe 
 who with soft lips salute returning spring 
 450 and hail the zephyr quivering on his wing

 with streaming eyes my vegetable care

unhappy wit , like most mistaken things 
 atones not for that envy which it brings 
 in youth alone its empty praise we boast 
 but soon the short liv 'd vanity is lost 
 like some fair flow'r the early spring supplies 
 that gaily blooms , but ev'n in blooming dies 
 what is this wit , which must our cares employ 
 the owner 's wife , that other men enjoy 
 then most our trouble still when most admir 'd 
 and still the more we give , the more requir 'd 
 whose fame with pains we guard , but lose with ease 
 sure some to vex , but never all to please 
 ‘ tis what the vicious fear , the virtuous shun 
 by fools't is hated , and by knaves undone 

there was a youth around whose early way 
 white angels hung in converse and sweet choir 
 teaching in summer clouds his thought to stray 
 in cloud and far horizon to desire 
 his life was nursed in beauty , like the stream 
 born of clear showers and the mountain dew 
 close under snow clad summits where they gleam 
 forever pure against heaven 's orient blue 
 within the city 's shades he walked at last 
 faint and more faint in sad recessional 
 down the dim corridors of time outworn 
 a chorus ebbed from that forsaken past 
 a hymn of glories fled beyond recall 
 with the lost heights and splendor of life 's morn 

i hate the common road of praise 
 or what the gaping vulgar raise 
 which with a pleasant gale a while 
 fame hurries , but doth soone beguile 
 now envie ’ s sting it feeles , ere long

 thus chac ’ d , with weak ’ ned wings it dyes 
 or torne , on the bare ground it lyes 
 a private fame , a meane house , where 
 i live conceal ’ d from popular ayre

 but envy haunts things that are neere at hand 

those parts of thee that the world 's eye doth view 
 want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend 
 all tongues ( the voice of souls ) give thee that due 
 uttering bare truth , even so as foes commend 
 thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned 
 but those same tongues that give thee so thine own 
 in other accents do this praise confound 
 by seeing farther than the eye hath shown 
 they look into the beauty of thy mind 
 and that in guess they measure by thy deeds 
 then churls their thoughts ( although their eyes were kind 
 to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds 
 but why thy odour matcheth not thy show 
 the soil is this , that thou dost common grow 

those hours that with gentle work did frame 
 the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell 
 will play the tyrants to the very same 
 and that unfair which fairly doth excel 
 for never resting time leads summer on 
 to hideous winter and confounds him there 
 sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone 
 beauty o'erhyppphensnowed and bareness every where 
 then were not summer 's distillation left 
 a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass 
 beauty 's effect with beauty were bereft 
 nor it nor no remembrance what it was 
 but flowers distilled though they with winter meet 
 leese but their show , their substance still lives sweet 

like as to make our appetite more keen 
 with eager compounds we our palate urge 
 as to prevent our maladies unseen 
 we sicken to shun sickness when we purge 
 even so being full of your ne'erhyppphencloying sweetness

 and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness 
 to be diseased ere that there was true needing 
 thus policy in love t ’ anticipate 
 the ills that were not , grew to faults assured 
 and brought to medicine a healthful state 
 which rank of goodness would by ill be cured

i have dreamed of death :— what will it be to die 
 not in a dream , but in the literal truth 
 with all death 's adjuncts ghastly and uncouth 
 the pang that is the last and the last sigh 
 too dulled , it may be , for a last good bye 
 too comfortless for any one to soothe 
 a helpless charmless spectacle of ruth 
 through long last hours , so long while yet they fly 
 so long to those who hopeless in their fear 
 watch the slow breath and look for what they dread 
 while i supine , with ears that cease to hear 
 with eyes that glaze , with heart pulse running down

 glows in the stars , and blossoms in the trees 
 lives thro ’ all life , extends thro ’ all extent 
 spreads undivided , operates unspent 
 breathes in our soul , informs our mortal part 
 as full , as perfect , in a hair as heart 
 as full , as perfect , in vile man that mourns 
 as the rapt seraph that adores and burns 
 to him no high , no low , no great , no small 
 he fills , he bounds , connects , and equals all 

thus the poor ass whose appetite has ne'er 
 known than the thistle any sweeter fare 
 thinks all the world eats thistles . thus the clown 
 the wit and mentor of the country town 
 grins through the collar of a horse and thinks 
 others for pleasure do as he for drinks 
 though secretly , because unwilling still 
 in public to attest their lack of skill 
 each dunce whose life and mind all follies mar 
 believes as he is all men living are 
 his vices theirs , their understandings his 
 naught that he knows not , all he fancies , is 
 how odd that any mind such stuff should boast 
 how natural to write it in the post 

of old i wandered by the river 's side 
 between whose banks the mighty waters glide 
 where vast niagara , hurrying to its fall 
 builds and unbuilds its ever tumbling wall 
 oft in my dreams i hear the rush and roar 
 of battling floods , and feel the trembling shore 
 as the huge torrent , girded for its leap 
 with bellowing thunders plunges down the steep 
 not less distinct , from memory 's pictured urn 
 the gray old rock , the leafy woods , return 
 robed in their pride the lofty oaks appear 
 and once again with quickened sense i hear 
 through the low murmur of the leaves that stir 
 the tinkling teardrop of la roche qui pleure 

a cloud has lowered that shall not soon pass o'er 
 the world takes sides : whether for impious aims 
 with tyranny whose bloody toll enflames 
 a generous people to heroic war 
 whether with freedom , stretched in her own gore 
 whose pleading hands and suppliant distress 
 still offer hearts that thirst for righteousness 
 a glorious cause to strike or perish for 
 england , which side is thine ? thou hast had sons 
 would shrink not from the choice however grim 
 were justice trampled on and courage downed 
 which will they be — cravens or champions 
 oh , if a doubt intrude , remember him 
 whose death made missolonghi holy ground 

the dead and dying in his pathway lie 
 before him ranks divide and squadrons fly 
 with stalwart arm , and with unerring aim 
 he adds new glories to his former fame 
 reaps the reward of all his toil : for now 
 fresh laurels twine around his youthful brow 
 but what avail they ? for the fatal dart 
 of death has lodged within that hoping heart 
 the lofty head that wore the waving crest 
 now sadly droops upon the bleeding breast 
 that mighty arm , upraised in power and pride 
 falls feebly down , and casts its sword aside 
 the laurel wreath entwines that brow in vain 
 for , lo ! the hero lies among the slain 

while i gazed at that fair one 's cheek , a shade 
 of thought or care stole softly over 
 like that by a cloud in a summer 's day made 
 looking down on a field of blossoming clover 
 the rose yet lay on her cheek , but its flush 
 had something lost of its brilliant blush 
 and the light in her eye , and the light on the wheels 
 that marched so calmly round above her 
 was a little dimmed ,— as when evening steals 
 upon noon 's hot face . yet one could n't but love her 
 for she looked like a mother whose first babe lay 
 rocked on her breast , as she swung all day 
 and she seemed , in the same silver tone , to say 
 “ passing away ! passing away 

“ still may our souls , o generous youth ! agree 
 ’ tis now atrides ’ turn to yield to thee 
 rash heat perhaps a moment might control 
 not break , the settled temper of thy soul 
 not but ( my friend ) ’ tis still the wiser way 
 to waive contention with superior sway 
 for ah ! how few , who should like thee offend 
 like thee , have talents to regain the friend 
 to plead indulgence , and thy fault atone 
 suffice thy father ’ s merit and thy own 
 generous alike , for me , the sire and son 
 have greatly suffer ’ d , and have greatly done 
 i yield ; that all may know , my soul can bend 
 nor is my pride preferr ’ d before my friend 

oh , thou whose melody the heart obeys 
 thou who can'st all its subject passions move 
 whose notes to heav'n the list'ning soul can raise 
 can thrill with pity , or can melt with love 
 happy ! whom nature lent this native charm 
 whose melting tones can shed with magic power 
 a sweeter pleasure o'er the social hour 
 the breast to softness sooth , to virtue warm — but 
 yet more happy ! that thy life as clear 
 from discord , as thy perfect cadence flows 
 that tun 'd to sympathy , thy faithful tear 
 in mild accordance falls for others woes 
 that all the tender , pure affections bind 
 in chains of harmony , thy willing mind 

ioy of my life ! full oft for loving you 
 i blesse my lot , that was so lucky placed 
 but then the more your owne mishap i rew 
 that are so much by so meane love embased 
 for had the equall hevens so much you graced 
 in this as in the rest , ye mote invent 
 some hevenly wit , whose verse could have enchased 
 your glorious name in golden moniment 
 but since ye deignd so goodly to relent 
 to me your thrall , in whom is little worth 
 that little that i am shall all be spent 
 in setting your immortal prayses forth 
 whose lofty argument , uplifting me 
 shall lift you up unto an high degree 

alack what poverty my muse brings forth 
 that having such a scope to show her pride 
 the argument all bare is of more worth 
 than when it hath my added praise beside 
 o blame me not if i no more can write 
 look in your glass and there appears a face 
 that over goes my blunt invention quite 
 dulling my lines , and doing me disgrace 
 were it not sinful then striving to mend 
 to mar the subject that before was well 
 for to no other pass my verses tend 
 than of your graces and your gifts to tell 
 and more , much more than in my verse can sit 
 your own glass shows you , when you look in it 

o opulent life of ours , though dispossessed 
 of treasure after treasure ! youth most fair 
 went first , but left its priceless coil of hair 
 moaned over sleepless nights , kissed and caressed 
 through drip and blur of tears the tenderest 
 and next went love — the ripe rose glowing there 
 her very sister !... it is here ; but where 
 is she , of all the world the first and best 
 and yet how sweet the sweet earth after rain 
 how sweet the sunlight on the garden wall 
 across the roses — and how sweetly flows 
 the limpid yodel of the brook again 
 and yet — and yet how sweeter after all 
 the smouldering sweetness of a dead red rose 

followed no pause — to g í w enough was said 
 nor rest , nor taste of food , his speed delayed 
 and when arrived , where z á bul 's bowers exhale 
 ambrosial sweets and scent the balmy gale 
 the sentinel 's loud voice in rustem 's ear 
 announced a messenger from persia , near 
 the chief himself amidst his warriors stood 
 dispensing honours to the brave and good 
 and soon as g í w had joined the martial ring 
 ( the sacred envoy of the persian king 
 he , with becoming loyalty inspired 
 asked what the monarch , what the state required 
 but g í w , apart , his secret mission told 
 the written page was speedily unrolled 

sweet song flower of the mayspring of our song 
 be welcome to us , with loving thanks and praise 
 to his good hand who travelling on strange ways 
 found thee forlorn and fragrant , lain along 
 beneath dead leaves that many a winter 's wrong 
 had rained and heaped through nigh three centuries ’ maze 
 above thy maybloom , hiding from our gaze 
 the life that in thy leaves lay sweet and strong 
 for thine have life , while many above thine head 
 piled by the wind lie blossomless and dead 
 so now disburdened of such load above 
 that lay as death 's own dust upon thee shed 
 by days too deaf to hear thee like a dove 
 murmuring , we hear thee , bird and flower of love 

if ever any justly might complain 
 of unrequited service , it is i 
 change is the thanks i have for loyalty 
 and only her reward is her disdain 
 so as just spite did almost me constrain 
 through torment her due praises to deny 
 for he which vex è d is with injury 
 by speaking ill doth ease his heart of pain 
 but what , shall torture make me wrong her name 
 no , no , a pris'ner constant thinks it shame 
 though he ( were ) racked his first truth to gainsay 
 her true given praise my first confession is 
 though her disdain do rack me night and day 
 this i confessed , and will deny in this 

full many a glorious morning have i seen 
 flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye 
 kissing with golden face the meadows green 
 gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy 
 anon permit the basest clouds to ride 
 with ugly rack on his celestial face 
 and from the forlorn world his visage hide 
 stealing unseen to west with this disgrace 
 even so my sun one early morn did shine 
 with all triumphant splendour on my brow 
 but out alack , he was but one hour mine 
 the region cloud hath masked him from me now 
 yet him for this , my love no whit disdaineth 
 suns of the world may stain , when heaven 's sun staineth 

no , friend , you do not beat me : hearken why 
 the common problem , yours , mine , every one 's 
 is — not to fancy what were fair in life 
 provided it could be — but , finding first 
 what may be , then find how to make it fair 
 up to our means : a very different thing 
 no abstract intellectual plan of life 
 quite irrespective of life 's plainest laws 
 but one , a man , who is man and nothing more 
 may lead within a world which ( by your leave 
 is rome or london , not fool'shyppphenparadise 
 embellish rome , idealize away 
 make paradise of london if you can 
 you 're welcome , nay , you 're wise 

you , while in life , are honoured as divine 
 and vows and oaths are taken at your shrine 
 so rome pays homage to her man of men 
 ne'er seen on earth before , ne'er to be seen again 
 but this wise nation , which for once thinks true 
 that nought in greece or here can rival you 
 to all things else a different test applies 
 and looks on living worth with jaundiced eyes 
 while , as for ancient models , take the code 
 which to the ten wise men our fathers owed 
 the treaties made ‘ twixt gabii 's kings and home 's 
 the pontiffs ’ books , the bards ’ forgotten tomes 
 they 'll swear the muses framed them every one 
 in close divan on alba 's helicon 

thus am i mine own prison . everything 
 around me free and sunny and at ease 
 or if in shadow , in a shade of trees 
 which the sun kisses , where the gay birds sing 
 and where all winds make various murmuring 
 where bees are found , with honey for the bees 
 where sounds are music , and where silences 
 are music of an unlike fashioning 
 then gaze i at the merrymaking crew 
 and smile a moment and a moment sigh 
 thinking : why can i not rejoice with you 
 but soon i put the foolish fancy by 
 i am not what i have nor what i do 
 but what i was i am , i am even i 

my spotless love hovers with purest wings 
 about the temple of the proudest frame 
 where blaze those lights , fairest of earthly things 
 which clear our clouded world with brightest flame 
 m'ambitious thoughts , confin è d in her face 
 affect no honour but what she can give 
 my hopes do rest in limits of her grace 
 i weigh no comfort unless she relieve 
 for she that can my heart imparadise 
 holds in her fairest hand what dearest is 
 my fortune 's wheel 's the circle of her eyes 
 whose rolling grace deign once a turn of bliss 
 all my life 's sweet consists in her alone 
 so much i love the most unloving one 

“ ‘ i died for thee ; for thee i am alive 
 and my humanity doth mourn for thee 
 for thou art mine ; and all thy little ones 
 they , too , are mine , are mine . behold , the house 
 is dark , but there is brightness where the sons 
 of god are singing , and , behold , the heart 
 is troubled : yet the nations walk in white 
 they have forgotten how to weep ; and thou 
 shalt also come , and i will foster thee 
 and satisfy thy soul ; and thou shall warm 
 thy trembling life beneath the smile of god 
 a little while — it is a little while 
 a little while , and i will comfort thee 
 i go away , but i will come again 

his house was known to all the vagrant train 
 he chid their wanderings , but relieved their pain 
 the long remembered beggar was his guest 
 whose beard , descending , swept his aged breast 
 the ruined spendthrift , now no longer proud 
 claimed kindred there , and had his claims allowed 
 the broken soldier , kindly bade to stay 
 sat by his fire and talked the night away 
 wept o'er his wounds , or , tales of sorrow done 
 shouldered his crutch , and showed how fields were won 
 pleased with his guests , the good man learned to glow 
 and quite forgot their vices in their woe 
 careless their merits or their faults to scan 
 his pity gave ere charity began 

ah ! once again the long left wires among 
 truants the muse to weave her requiem song 
 with sterner lore now busied , erst the lay 
 cheer 'd my dark morn of manhood , wont to stray 
 o'er fancy 's fields in quest of musky flower 
 to me nor fragrant less , though barr 'd from view 
 and courtship of the world : hail 'd was the hour 
 that gave me , dripping fresh with nature 's dew 
 poor henry 's budding beauties — to a clime 
 hapless transplanted , whose exotic ray 
 forced their young vigour into transient day 
 and drain 'd the stalk that rear 'd them ! and shall time 
 trample these orphan blossoms ?— no ! they breathe 
 still lovelier charms — for southey culls the wreath 

mountains ! and huge hills ! wrap your mighty forms 
 close with mantle of eternal cloud 
 gather around ye the fierce band of storms 
 and let the stainless snow drift be your shroud 
 back from your rugged steeps , and caverns hoar 
 bellow in hoarse disdain the tempest 's roar 
 laugh at the rolling thunder ; let the flash 
 of its fierce lightning lumine but your scorn 
 down your deep furrow 'd slopes let torrents dash 
 and on the winds their hollow rage be borne 
 ye mighty ones ! why should ye bow your pride 
 and doff your venerable crowns , or dress 
 your wrinkled brows in smiles , or lay aside 
 the dread insignias of your mightiness 

like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore 
 so do our minutes hasten to their end 
 each changing place with that which goes before 
 in sequent toil all forwards do contend 
 nativity once in the main of light 
 crawls to maturity , wherewith being crowned 
 crooked eclipses ‘ gainst his glory fight 
 and time that gave , doth now his gift confound 
 time doth transfix the flourish set on youth 
 and delves the parallels in beauty 's brow 
 feeds on the rarities of nature 's truth 
 and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow 
 and yet to times in hope , my verse shall stand 
 praising thy worth , despite his cruel hand 

returning from its daily quest , my spirit 
 changed thoughts and vile in thee doth weep to find 
 it grieves me that thy mild and gentle mind 
 those ample virtues which it did inherit 
 has lost . once thou didst loathe the multitude 
 of blind and madding men — i then loved thee 
 i loved thy lofty songs and that sweet mood 
 when thou wert faithful to thyself and me 
 i dare not now through thy degraded state 
 own the delight thy strains inspire — in vain 
 i seek what once thou wert — we cannot meet 
 and we were wont . again and yet again 
 ponder my words : so the false spirit shall fly 
 and leave to thee thy true integrity 

if e'er the sacred poem that hath made 
 both heav'n and earth copartners in its toil 
 and with lean abstinence , through many a year 
 faded my brow , be destin 'd to prevail 
 over the cruelty , which bars me forth 
 of the fair sheep fold , where a sleeping lamb 
 the wolves set on and fain had worried me 
 with other voice and fleece of other grain 
 i shall forthwith return , and , standing up 
 at my baptismal font , shall claim the wreath 
 due to the poet 's temples : for i there 
 first enter 'd on the faith which maketh souls 
 acceptable to god : and , for its sake 
 peter had then circled my forehead thus 

and how felt he , the wretched man 
 reclining there — while memory ran 
 o'er many a year of guilt and strife 
 flew o'er the dark flood of his life 
 nor found one sunny resting place 
 nor brought him back one branch of grace 
 “ there was a time , ” he said , in mild 
 heart humbled tones , “ thou blessed child 
 when , young and haply pure as thou 
 i looked and prayed like thee — but now 
 he hung his head — each nobler aim 
 and hope , and feeling , which had slept 
 from boyhood 's hour , that instant came 
 fresh o'er him , and he wept — he wept 

wilt thou love god as he thee ? then digest 
 my soul ! this wholesome meditation 
 how god the spirit , by angels waited on 
 in heaven , doth make his temple in thy breast 
 the father having begot a son most blest 
 and still begetting , ( for he ne'er begun 
 hath deigned to choose thee by adoption 
 co heir to his glory , and sabbath 's endless rest 
 and as a robbed man , which by search doth find 
 his stol'n stuff sold , must lose or buy ‘ t again 
 the sun of glory came down and was slain 
 us , whom he had made , and satan stole , to unbind 
 ‘ twas much that man was made like god before 
 but that god should be made like man much more 

the lab'ring poor , in spite of double pay 
 are saucy , mutinous , and beggarly 
 so lavish of their money and their time 
 that want of forecast is the nation 's crime 
 good drunken company is their delight 
 and what they get by day they spend by night 
 dull thinking seldom does their heads engage 
 but drink their youth away , and hurry on old age 
 empty of all good husbandry and sense 
 and void of manners most when void of pence 
 their strong aversion to behaviour 's such 
 they always talk too little or too much 
 so dull , they never take the pains to think 
 and seldom are good natured but in drink 

and how fare you ? if you deserve in truth 
 the name men give you , you 're a happy youth 
 rome 's thousand tongues , agreed at least in this 
 ascribe to you a plenitude of bliss 
 yet , when you judge of self , i fear you 're prone 
 to take another 's word before your own 
 to think of happiness as ‘ twere a prize 
 that men may win though neither good nor wise 
 just so the glutton whom the world thinks well 
 keeps dark his fever till the dinner bell 
 then , as he 's eating , with his hands well greased 
 shivering comes on , and proves the fool diseased 
 o , ‘ tis a false , false shame that would conceal 
 from doctors ’ eyes the sores it cannot heal 

not sweeter to the storm tossed mariner 
 is glimpse of home , where wife and children wait 
 to welcome him with kisses at the gate 
 than to the town worn man the breezy stir 
 of mountain winds on rugged pathless heights 
 his long pent soul drinks in the deep delights 
 that nature hath in store . the sun kissed bay 
 gleams thro ’ the grand old gnarled gum tree boughs 
 like burnished brass ; the strong winged bird of prey 
 sweeps by , upon his lonely vengeful way 
 while over all , like breath of holy vows 
 the sweet airs blow , and the high vaulted sky 
 looks down in pity this fair summer day 
 on all poor earth born creatures doomed to die 

how can i think , or edge my thoughts to action 
 when the miserly press of each day ’ s need 
 aches to a narrowness of spilled distraction 
 my soul appalled at the world ’ s work ’ s time greed 
 how can i pause my thoughts upon the task 
 my soul was born to think that it must do 
 when every moment has a thought to ask 
 to fit the immediate craving of its cue 
 the coin i ’ d heap for marrying my muse 
 and build our home i ’ th ’ greater time to be 
 becomes dissolved by needs of each day ’ s use 
 and i feel beggared of infinity 
 like a true christian sinner , each day flesh driven 
 by his own act to forfeit his wished heaven 

we wander on through life as pilgrims do 
 o'er trackless deserts to a distant shrine 
 weary and parch 'd , and to our longing view 
 springs many a false mirage of joy divine 
 that fades before us as we fain pursue 
 the empty picture which our fancy drew 
 o thou , my heart ! seek not the empty shows 
 and gilded nothings of this little time 
 but let thine endless effort be to climb 
 above earth 's petty vanities and woes 
 unto a nobler range of feelings , joys 
 which no false leaven of decay alloys 
 but whose substantial sweetness may increase 
 and make thy journey pleasure , and thy slumber peace 

when we consider what this life we lead 
 is not , and is ; how full of toil and pain 
 how blank of rest and of substantial gain 
 beset by hunger earth can never feed 
 and propping half our hearts upon a reed 
 we cease to mourn lost treasures mourned in vain 
 lost treasures we are fain and yet not fain 
 to fetch back for a solace of our need 
 for who that feel this burden and this strain 
 this wide vacuity of hope and heart 
 would bring their cherished well beloved again 
 to bleed with them and wince beneath the smart 
 to have with stinted bliss such lavish bane 
 to hold in lieu of all so poor a part 

if all the flowers of all the fields on earth 
 by wonder working summer were made one 
 its fragrance were not sweeter in the sun 
 its treasure house of leaves were not more worth 
 than those wherefrom thy light of musing mirth 
 shone , till each leaf whereon thy pen would run 
 breathed life , and all its breath was benison 
 beloved beyond all names of english birth 
 more dear than mightier memories ; gentlest name 
 that ever clothed itself with flower sweet fame 
 or linked itself with loftiest names of old 
 by right and might of loving ; i , that am 
 less than the least of those within thy fold 
 give only thanks for them to thee , charles lamb 

if the dull substance of my flesh were thought 
 injurious distance should not stop my way 
 for then despite of space i would be brought 
 from limits far remote , where thou dost stay 
 no matter then although my foot did stand 
 upon the farthest earth removed from thee 
 for nimble thought can jump both sea and land 
 as soon as think the place where he would be 
 but ah , thought kills me that i am not thought 
 to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone 
 but that so much of earth and water wrought 
 i must attend , time 's leisure with my moan 
 receiving nought by elements so slow 
 but heavy tears , badges of either 's woe 

thus as she spoke , swift iris disappear 'd 
 then juno thus to pallas spoke : “ no more 
 daughter of aegis bearing jove , can we 
 for mortal men his sov'reign will resist 
 live they or die , as each man 's fate may be 
 while he , ‘ twixt greeks and trojans , as ‘ tis meet 
 his own designs accomplishing , decides 
 she said , and backward turn 'd her horses ’ heads 
 the horses from the car the hours unyok 'd 
 and safely tether 'd in the heav'nly stalls 
 the car they rear 'd against the inner wall 
 that brightly polish 'd shone ; the goddesses 
 themselves meanwhile , amid th ’ immortals all 
 with , sorrowing hearts on golden seats reclin 'd 

yea , this is he , whose name is synonym 
 of all that 's noble , though but lowly born 
 who took command upon a stormy morn 
 when few had hope . although uncouth of limb 
 homely of face and gaunt , but never grim 
 beautiful he was with that which none may scorn 
 with love of god and man and things forlorn 
 and freedom mighty as the soul in him 
 large at the helm of state he leans and looms 
 with the grave , kindly look of those who die 
 doing their duty . stanch , unswervingly 
 onward he steers beneath portentous glooms 
 and overwhelming thunders of the sky 
 till , safe in port , he sees a people free 

then let not winter 's ragged hand deface 
 in thee thy summer ere thou be distilled 
 make sweet some vial ; treasure thou some place 
 with beauty 's treasure ere it be self killed 
 that use is not forbidden usury 
 which happies those that pay the willing loan 
 that 's for thy self to breed another thee 
 or ten times happier be it ten for one 
 ten times thy self were happier than thou art 
 if ten of thine ten times refigured thee 
 then what could death do if thou shouldst depart 
 leaving thee living in posterity 
 be not self willed for thou art much too fair 
 to be death 's conquest and make worms thine heir 

ye heavenly spirites , whose ashie cinders lie 
 under deep ruines , with huge walls opprest 
 but not your praise , the which shall never die 
 through your faire verses , ne in ashes rest 
 if so be shrilling voyce of wight alive 
 may reach from hence to depth of darkest hell 
 then let those deep abysses open rive 
 that ye may understand my shreiking yell 
 thrice having seene under the heavens veale 
 your toombs devoted compasse over all 
 thrice unto you with lowd voyce i appeale 
 and for your antique furie here doo call 
 the whiles that i with sacred horror sing 
 your glorie , fairest of all earthly thing 

the wide , bright temple of the world i found 
 and entered from the dizzy infinite 
 that i might kneel and worship thee in it 
 leaving the singing stars their ceaseless round 
 of silver music sound on orbed sound 
 for measured spaces where the shrines are lit 
 and men with wisdom or with little wit 
 implore the gods that mercy may abound 
 ah , aphrodite , was it not from thee 
 my summons came across the endless spaces 
 mother of love , turn not thy face from me 
 now that i seek for thee in human faces 
 answer my prayer or set my spirit free 
 again to drift along the starry places 

` thou mayst allone here wepe and crye and knele

 and she wol quyte that thou shalt not fele

but gareth spake and all indignantly 
 ‘ fool , for thou hast , men say , the strength of ten 
 canst thou not trust the limbs thy god hath given 
 but must , to make the terror of thee more 
 trick thyself out in ghastly imageries 
 of that which life hath done with , and the clod 
 less dull than thou , will hide with mantling flowers 
 as if for pity ? ’ but he spake no word 
 which set the horror higher : a maiden swooned 
 the lady lyonors wrung her hands and wept 
 as doomed to be the bride of night and death 
 sir gareth 's head prickled beneath his helm 
 and even sir lancelot through his warm blood felt 
 ice strike , and all that marked him were aghast 

louder and louder still the awful roar 
 pealed from the heights , and shook the frightened shore 
 thick clouds of smoke enveloped friend and foe 
 the volleyed thunder shook the depths below 
 mountain and echoing forest joined the cry 
 and distant hills gave back the same reply 
 with animating voice and waving hand 
 the british leader cheered his gallant band 
 pressed firmly forward where one endless tide 
 of woe and carnage reigned on every side 
 where streams of blood in crimson torrents rolled 
 where death smote down alike the young and old 
 and where the thickest poured the deadly shot 
 the gallant wolfe with daring valor fought 

the panther , knowing that his spotted hyde 
 doth please all beasts , but that his looks them fray 
 within a bush his dreadful head doth hide 
 to let them gaze , whylst he on them may pray 
 right so my cruell fayre with me doth play 
 for with the goodly semblance of her hew 
 she doth allure me to mine owne decay 
 and then no mercy will unto me shew 
 great shame it is , thing so divine in view 
 made for to be the worlds most ornament 
 to make the bayte her gazers to embrew 
 good shames to be to ill an instrument 
 but mercy doth with beautie best agree 
 as in theyr maker ye them best may see 

hear what the desolate rizpah said 
 as on gibeah 's rocks she watched the dead 
 the sons of michal before her lay 
 and her own fair children , dearer than they 
 by a death of shame they all had died 
 and were stretched on the bare rock , side by side 
 and rizpah , once the loveliest of all 
 that bloomed and smiled in the court of saul 
 all wasted with watching and famine now 
 and scorched by the sun her haggard brow 
 sat mournfully guarding their corpses there 
 and murmured a strange and solemn air 
 the low , heart broken , and wailing strain 
 of a mother that mourns her children slain 

thus vulcan spoke : and rising with a bound 
 the double bowl with sparkling nectar crown ’ d 
 which held to juno in a cheerful way 
 “ goddess ( he cried ) , be patient and obey 
 dear as you are , if jove his arm extend 
 i can but grieve , unable to defend 
 what god so daring in your aid to move 
 or lift his hand against the force of jove 
 once in your cause i felt his matchless might 
 hurl ’ d headlong down from the ethereal height 
 toss ’ d all the day in rapid circles round 
 nor till the sun descended touch ’ d the ground 
 breathless i fell , in giddy motion lost 
 the sinthians raised me on the lemnian coast 

mild arch of promise ! on the evening sky 
 thou shinest fair with many a lovely ray 
 each in the other melting . much mine eye 
 delights to linger on thee ; for the day 
 changeful and many weather 'd , seem 'd to smile 
 flashing brief splendor thro ’ its clouds awhile 
 that deepen 'd dark anon and fell in rain 
 but pleasant is it now to pause , and view 
 thy various tints of frail and watery hue 
 and think the storm shall not return again 
 such is the smile that piety bestows 
 on the good man 's pale cheek , when he in peace 
 departing gently from a world of woes 
 anticipates the realm where sorrows cease 

forgive me , dear , for thundering on thy name 
 sure ‘ tis thyself that shows my love distrest 
 for fire exhaled in freezing clouds possessed 
 warring for way , makes all the heavens exclaim 
 thy beauty so , the brightest living flame 
 wrapt in my cloudy heart , by winter prest 
 scorning to dwell within so base a nest 
 thunders in me thy everlasting flame 
 o that my heart might still contain that fire 
 or that the fire would always light my heart 
 then should'st thou not disdain my true desire 
 or think i wronged thee to reveal to my smart 
 for as the fire through freezing clouds doth break 
 so not myself but thou in me would'st speak 

why is my verse so barren of new pride 
 so far from variation or quick change 
 why with the time do i not glance aside 
 to new found methods , and to compounds strange 
 why write i still all one , ever the same 
 and keep invention in a noted weed 
 that every word doth almost tell my name 
 showing their birth , and where they did proceed 
 o know sweet love i always write of you 
 and you and love are still my argument 
 so all my best is dressing old words new 
 spending again what is already spent 
 for as the sun is daily new and old 
 so is my love still telling what is told 

one spring brought me my wedding day 
 brought me my bright eyed jeanne amray 
 brought that night to our cabin door 
 my old , lost comrade , nell latore 
 her eyes swam fire , and her cheek was red 
 her full breast heaved as she darkly said 
 “ the coyote hides from the wind and rain 
 the wild horse flies from the hurricane 
 but who can flee from the half breed 's hate 
 that rises soon and that watches late 
 then went ; and i laughed jeanne 's fears afar 
 but i thought that wench was our evil star 
 be sure , when a woman 's heart gets hard 
 it works up war like a navy yard 

some hold it strange that love like thine and mine 
 ‘ twixt two in state so sunder 'd should be bred 
 that he who did all worths in him combine 
 birth , beauty , wit , wealth , me thus honour è d 
 me , the poor motley , maim 'd by fortune 's spite 
 sear 'd and o'erworn with tyranny of time 
 whose wit was but the wit to learn to write 
 when thou , my muse , inspir'dst my pupil rhyme 
 thou wert the wide world 's pride , but i his scorn 
 his pattern thou , i his poor toy and tool 
 whence therefore should that tender love be born 
 ‘ twixt fortune 's minion thee , and me her fool 
 o know they not that all such outward things 
 hold lowest count in the soul 's reckonings 

if thou hadst built a temple , how my eye 
 had hungering fed thereon , from low browed crypt 
 up to the soaring pinnacles that , tipt 
 with stars , gave signal when the sun drew nigh 
 dark caverns in and under ; vivid sky 
 its home and aim ! say , from the glory slipt 
 and down into the shadows dropt and dipt 
 or reared from darkness up so holy high 
 thou build'st the temple of thy holy ghost 
 from hid foundation to high hidden fate 
 foot in the grave , head at the heavenly gate 
 from grave and sky filled with a fighting host 
 man is thy temple ; man thy work elect 
 his glooms and glory thine , great architect 

my love is strengthened though more weak in seeming 
 i love not less , though less the show appear 
 that love is merchandized , whose rich esteeming 
 the owner 's tongue doth publish every where 
 our love was new , and then but in the spring 
 when i was wont to greet it with my lays 
 as philomel in summer 's front doth sing 
 and stops her pipe in growth of riper days 
 not that the summer is less pleasant now 
 than when her mournful hymns did hush the night 
 but that wild music burthens every bough 
 and sweets grown common lose their dear delight 
 therefore like her , i sometime hold my tongue 
 because i would not dull you with my song 

ye sacred ruines , and ye tragick sights 
 which onely doo the name of rome retaine 
 olde moniments , which of so famous sprights 
 the honour yet in ashes doo maintaine 
 triumphant arcks , spyres neighbours to the skie 
 that you to see doth th'heaven it selfe appall 
 alas ! by little ye to nothing flie 
 the peoples fable , and the spoyle of all 
 and though your frames do for a time make warre 
 gainst time , yet time in time shall ruinate 
 your workes and names , and your last reliques marre 
 my sad desires , rest therefore moderate 
 for if that time make ende of things so sure 
 it als will end the paine which i endure 

take any station , pavement , circus , corner 
 where men their styles of print may call or choose 
 and there — ten times more on it than jack horner 
 there shall you find him swathed in sheets of news 
 nothing can stay the placing of his wares 
 not bus , nor cab , nor dray ! the very slop 
 that imp of power , is powerless ! ever he dares 
 and , daring , lands his public neck and crop 
 even the many tortured london ear 
 the much enduring , loathes his speeshul yell 
 his shriek of winnur ! but his dart and leer 
 and poise are irresistible . pall mall 
 joys in him , and mile end ; for his vocation 
 is to purvey the stuff of conversation 

take all my loves , my love , yea take them all 
 what hast thou then more than thou hadst before 
 no love , my love , that thou mayst true love call 
 all mine was thine , before thou hadst this more 
 then if for my love , thou my love receivest 
 i cannot blame thee , for my love thou usest 
 but yet be blamed , if thou thy self deceivest 
 by wilful taste of what thy self refusest 
 i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief 
 although thou steal thee all my poverty 
 and yet love knows it is a greater grief 
 to bear love 's wrong , than hate 's known injury 
 lascivious grace , in whom all ill well shows 
 kill me with spites yet we must not be foes 

the shivering wind sits in the oaks , whose limbs 
 twisted and tortured , nevermore are still 
 grief and decay sit with it ; they , whose chill 
 autumnal touch makes hectic red the rims 
 of all the oak leaves ; desolating , dims 
 the ageratum 's blue that banks the rill 
 and splits the milkweed 's pod upon the hill 
 and shakes it free of the last seed that swims 
 down goes the day despondent to its close 
 and now the sunset 's hands of copper build 
 a tower of brass , behind whose burning bars 
 the day , in fierce , barbarian repose 
 like some imprisoned inca sits , hate filled 
 crowned with the gold corymbus of the stars 

o sacred , just , inevitable scorn 
 strong child of righteous judgment , whom with grief 
 the rent heart bears , and wins not yet relief 
 seeing of its pain so dire a portent born 
 must thou not spare one sheaf of all the corn 
 one doit of all the treasure ? not one sheaf 
 not one poor doit of all ? not one dead leaf 
 of all that fell and left behind a thorn 
 is man so strong that one should scorn another 
 is any as god , not made of mortal mother 
 that love should turn in him to gall and flame 
 nay : but the true is not the false heart 's brother 
 love cannot love disloyalty : the name 
 that else it wears is love no more , but shame 

with fierce regard achilles answer 'd thus 
 “ hector , thou object of my deadly hate 
 talk not to me of compacts ; as ‘ tween men 
 and lions no firm concord can exist 
 nor wolves and lambs in harmony unite 
 but ceaseless enmity between them dwells 
 so not in friendly terms , nor compact firm 
 can thou and i unite , till one of us 
 glut with his blood the mail clad warrior mars 
 mind thee of all thy fence ; behoves thee now 
 to prove a spearman skill 'd , and warrior brave 
 for thee escape is none ; now , by my spear 
 hath pallas doom 'd thy death ; my comrades ’ blood 
 which thou hast shed , shall all be now aveng 'd 

o call not me to justify the wrong 
 that thy unkindness lays upon my heart 
 wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue 
 use power with power , and slay me not by art 
 tell me thou lov'st elsewhere ; but in my sight 
 dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside 
 what need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might 
 is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide 
 let me excuse thee , ah my love well knows 
 her pretty looks have been mine enemies 
 and therefore from my face she turns my foes 
 that they elsewhere might dart their injuries 
 yet do not so , but since i am near slain 
 kill me outright with looks , and rid my pain 

farewell ! thou art too dear for my possessing 
 and like enough thou know'st thy estimate 
 the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing 
 my bonds in thee are all determinate 
 for how do i hold thee but by thy granting 
 and for that riches where is my deserving 
 the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting 
 and so my patent back again is swerving 
 thy self thou gav'st , thy own worth then not knowing 
 or me to whom thou gav'st it , else mistaking 
 so thy great gift upon misprision growing 
 comes home again , on better judgement making 
 thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter 
 in sleep a king , but waking no such matter 

alas ! we poured into the wavy sea 
 the strength of our two founts in vain 
 for two opposing powers hold it concealed 
 lest it go rolling aimlessly adown 
 the strength unmeasured of the burning heart 
 withholds a passage to the lofty streams 
 barring their twofold course unto the sea 
 nature abhors the covered ground . [ w 
 now say , afflicted heart , what canst thou bring 
 to oppose against us with an equal force 
 oh , where is he , will boast himself to be 
 exalted by this most unhappy love 
 if of thy pain and mine it can be said 
 the greater they , the less it may be seen 

said he , we now are in a place retired 
 unknown to man , ( such spots how oft desired 
 let 's take advantage of the present hour 
 no joys , but those of love , are in our pow'r 
 all others see withdrawn ! and no one knows 
 we even live ; perhaps both friends and foes 
 believe us in the belly of a whale 
 allow me , lovely princess , to prevail 
 bestow your kindness , or , without delay 
 those charms to mamolin let me convey 
 yet , why go thither ?— happy you could make 
 the man , whose constancy no perils shake 
 what would you more ?— his passion 's ardent grown 
 and surely you 've enough resistance shown 

if i were a dead leaf thou mightest bear 
 if i were a swift cloud to fly with thee 
 a wave to pant beneath thy power , and share 
 the impulse of thy strength , only less free 
 than thou , o uncontrollable ! if even 
 i were as in my boyhood , and could be 
 the comrade of thy wanderings over heaven 
 as then , when to outstrip the skyey speed 
 scarce seem 'd a vision , i would ne'er have striven 
 as thus with thee in prayer in my sore need 
 o lift me as a wave , a leaf , a cloud 
 i fall upon the thorns of life ! i bleed 
 a heavy weight of hours has chain 'd and bow 'd 
 one too like thee : tameless , and swift , and proud 

what meanes this numerous guard ? or do we come 
 to file our names or verse upon the tombe 
 of fletcher , and by boldly making knowne 
 his wit , betray the nothing of our owne 
 for if we grant him dead , it is as true 
 against our selves , no wit , no poet now 
 or if he be returnd from his coole shade 
 to us , this booke his resurrection 's made 
 we bleed our selves to death , and but contrive 
 by our owne epitaphs to shew him alive 
 but let him live and let me prophesie 
 as i goe swan like out , our peace is nigh 
 a balme unto the wounded age i sing 
 and nothing now is wanting but the king 

the goddess answer 'd : “ father , i obey 
 and point the wandering traveller his way 
 well known to me the palace you inquire 
 for fast beside it dwells my honour 'd sire 
 but silent march , nor greet the common train 
 with question needless , or inquiry vain 
 a race of ragged mariners are these 
 unpolish 'd men , and boisterous as their seas 
 the native islanders alone their care 
 and hateful he who breathes a foreign air

since dark december shrouds the transient day 
 and stormy winds are howling in their ire 
 why com'st not thou , who always can'st inspire 
 the soul of cheerfulness , and best array 
 a sullen hour in smiles ?— o haste to pay 
 the cordial visit sullen hours require 
 around the circling walls a glowing fire 
 shines ;— but it vainly shines in this delay 
 to blend thy spirit 's warm promethean light 
 come then , at science ’ , and at friendship 's call

the tablet of my heavy fortunes here 
 upon thine altar , paphian power , i place 
 the grievous shipwreck of my travels dear 
 in bulg è d bark , all perished in disgrace 
 that traitor love was pilot to my woe 
 my sails were hope , spread with my sighs of grief 
 the twin lights which my hapless course did show 
 hard by th'inconstant sands of false relief 
 were two bright stars which led my view apart 
 a siren 's voice allured me come so near 
 to perish on the marble of her heart 
 a danger which my soul did never fear 
 lo , thus he fares that trusts a calm too much 
 and thus fare i whose credit hath been such 

adieu ! dear girl ! if we are doom 'd to part 
 take with thee , take , the blessing of this heart 
 due to thy gentle mind , and cultur 'd sense 
 perhaps ‘ twill please , but , sure , can n't give offence 
 tho ’ , when we met , the solar ray was gone 
 and on our steps the moon beam only shone 
 yet well i mark 'd thy form and native grace 
 and all the sweet expression of thy face 
 and pleas 'd i listen 'd as thy accents fell 
 accents that spoke a feeling mind so well 
 lo , when the birds repose at ev'ning hour 
 the sweetest of them carols from her bow'r 
 so , when the dews the garden 's fragrance close 
 the night flow'r [ a ] blooms , the rival of the rose 

whoever thinks a faultless piece to see 
 thinks what ne'er was , nor is , nor e'er shall be 
 in every work regard the writer 's end 
 since none can compass more than they intend 
 and if the means be just , the conduct true 
 applause , in spite of trivial faults , is due 
 as men of breeding , sometimes men of wit 
 t ’ avoid great errors , must the less commit 
 neglect the rules each verbal critic lays 
 for not to know some trifles , is a praise 
 most critics , fond of some subservient art 
 still make the whole depend upon a part 
 they talk of principles , but notions prize 
 and all to one loved folly sacrifice 

so oft have i invoked thee for my muse 
 and found such fair assistance in my verse 
 as every alien pen hath got my use 
 and under thee their poesy disperse 
 thine eyes , that taught the dumb on high to sing 
 and heavy ignorance aloft to fly 
 have added feathers to the learned 's wing 
 and given grace a double majesty 
 yet be most proud of that which i compile 
 whose influence is thine , and born of thee 
 in others ’ works thou dost but mend the style 
 and arts with thy sweet graces graced be 
 but thou art all my art , and dost advance 
 as high as learning , my rude ignorance 

chaotic crags are huddled east and west 
 dark , heavy crags , against a straitened sea 
 that cometh , like a troubled soul in quest 
 of voiceless rest where never dwelleth rest 
 with noise “ like thunder everlasting 
 but here , behold a silent space of sand 
 oh , pilgrim , halt !— it even seems to be 
 asleep in other years . how still ! how grand 
 how awful in its wild solemnity 
 this is the spot on which the chief did land 
 and there , perchance , he stood what time a band 
 of yelling strangers scoured the savage lea 
 dear friend , with thoughtful eyes look slowly round 
 by all the sacred past ‘ tis sacred ground 

o steep and rugged life , whose harsh ascent 
 slopes blindly upward through the bitter night 
 they say that on thy summit , high in light 
 sweet rest awaits the climber , travel spent 
 but i , alas , with dusty garments rent 
 with fainting heart and failing limbs and sight 
 can see no glimmer of the shining height 
 and vainly list , with body forward bent 
 to catch athwart the gloom one wandering note 
 of those glad anthems which ( they say ) are sung 
 when one emerges from the mists below 
 but though , o life , thy summit be remote 
 and all thy stony path with darkness hung 
 yet ever upward through the night i go 

after so long a race as i have run 
 through faery land , which those six books compile 
 give leave to rest me being half foredonne 
 and gather to my selfe new breath awhile 
 then , as a steed refreshed after toyle 
 out of my prison i will break anew 
 and stoutly will that second work assoyle 
 with strong endevour and attention dew 
 till then give leave to me in pleasant mew 
 to sport my muse , and sing my loves sweet praise 
 the contemplation of whose heavenly hew 
 my spirit to an higher pitch will rayse 
 but let her prayses yet be low and meane 
 fit for the handmayd of the faery queene 

how oft when thou , my music , music play'st 
 upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds 
 with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st 
 the wiry concord that mine ear confounds 
 do i envy those jacks that nimble leap 
 to kiss the tender inward of thy hand 
 whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap 
 at the wood 's boldness by thee blushing stand 
 to be so tickled they would change their state 
 and situation with those dancing chips 
 o'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait 
 making dead wood more blest than living lips 
 since saucy jacks so happy are in this 
 give them thy fingers , me thy lips to kiss 

well , i felt for the lady , and felt for my hat too 
 improvised on the crown of the latter a tattoo 
 in lieu of expressing the feelings which lay 
 quite too deep for words , as wordsworth would say 
 then , without going through the form of a bow 
 found myself in the entry ,— i hardly knew how 
 on doorstep and sidewalk , past lamp post and square 
 at home and up stairs , in my own easy chair 
 poked my feet into slippers , my fire into blaze 
 and said to myself , as i lit my cigar 
 supposing a man had the wealth of the czar 
 of the russias to boot , for the rest of his days 
 on the whole do you think he would have much time to spare 
 if he married a woman with nothing to wear 

so now i have confessed that he is thine 
 and i my self am mortgaged to thy will 
 my self i 'll forfeit , so that other mine 
 thou wilt restore to be my comfort still 
 but thou wilt not , nor he will not be free 
 for thou art covetous , and he is kind 
 he learned but surety like to write for me 
 under that bond that him as fist doth bind 
 the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take 
 thou usurer that put'st forth all to use 
 and sue a friend , came debtor for my sake 
 so him i lose through my unkind abuse 
 him have i lost , thou hast both him and me 
 he pays the whole , and yet am i not free 

th ’ adventure charm 'd him , and next morning rose 
 the sabbath , with its silence and repose 
 the bells ceas 'd chiming , and the broad blue sky 
 smil 'd on his peace , and met his tranquil eye 
 inverted , from the foot bridge on his way 
 to that still house where all his fathers lay 
 there in his seat , each neighbour 's face he knew 
 the stranger girl was just before his pew 
 he saw her kneel , with meek , but cheerful air 
 and whisper the response to every prayer 
 and , when the humble roof with praises rung 
 he caught the hallelujah from her tongue 
 rememb'ring with delight the tears that fell 
 when the poor father bade his child farewell 

when men shall find thy flower , thy glory pass 
 and thou with careful brow sitting alone 
 receiv è d hast this message from thy glass 
 that tells the truth , and says that all is gone 
 fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou mad'st 
 though spent thy flame , in me the heat remaining 
 i that have loved thee thus before thou fad'st 
 my faith shall wax when thou art in thy waning 
 the world shall find this miracle in me 
 that fire can burn when all the matter 's spent 
 then what my faith hath been thyself shalt see 
 and that thou wast unkind thou mayst repent 
 thou mayst repent that thou hast scorned my tears 
 when winter snows upon thy sable hairs

one thinking to encrease the joys of life 
 marries a beautiful young buxom wife 
 but soon he finds himself grow cloy 'd and weak 
 nor can he give her half those joys she 'd take 
 he now consumptive , pale and meagre grows 
 while she complaining to her parents goes 
 says she can n't love him , such a one as he 
 and now desires she may live sep'rately 
 the poor fond parents to him trudge in haste 
 and reprimand him soundly for what 's past 
 he knows no cause — nor thinks he is to blame 
 they tell him plainly she shall live with them 
 and he allow her what is fit to have 
 which he must yield to if he 'll quiet have 

there drew he forth the brand excalibur 
 and o'er him , drawing it , the winter moon 
 brightening the skirts of a long cloud , ran forth 
 and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt 
 for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks 
 myriads of topaz lights , and jacinth work 
 of subtlest jewellery . he gazed so long 
 that both his eyes were dazzled as he stood 
 this way and that dividing the swift mind 
 in act to throw : but at the last it seem 'd 
 better to leave excalibur conceal 'd 
 there in the many knotted water flags 
 that whistled stiff and dry about the marge 
 so strode he back slow to the wounded king 

then welcome be it , if indeed it be 
 the irrepressible conflict ! let it come 
 there will be mitigation of the doom 
 if , battling to the last , our sires shall see 
 their sons contending for the homes made free 
 in ancient conflict with the foreign foe 
 if those who call us brethren strike the blow 
 no common conflict shall the invader know 
 war to the knife , and to the last , until 
 the sacred land we keep shall overflow 
 with blood as sacred — valley , wave , and hill 
 or the last enemy finds his bloody grave 
 aye , welcome to your graves — or ours ! the brave 
 may perish , but ye shall not bind one slave

then that dread angel near the awful throne 
 leaving the seraphs ranged in flaming tiers 
 winged his dark way through those unpinioned spheres 
 and on the void 's black beetling edge , alone 
 stood with raised wings , and listened for the tone 
 of god 's command to reach his eager ears 
 while chaos wavered , for she felt her years 
 unsceptered now in that convulsive zone 
 night trembled . and as one hath oft beheld 
 a lamp within a vase light up its gloom 
 so god 's voice lighted him , from heel to plume 
 “ let there be light ! ” it said , and darkness , quelled 
 shrunk noiseless backward in her monstrous womb 
 through vasts unwinnowed by the wings of eld

 or shall their ruthlesse torment never cease 
 but al my days in pining languor spend

 but that their cruelty doth still increace 
 and dayly more augment my miseryes

 of dazzling sheen , and clothed in robes of love 
 what this wild rage — this cataclysmic fall

 “ ‘ tis god ! the blest ! all elements are his 
 who rules the unfathonable dark abyss

 these are the wail of elemental life

 the blasting fire , with scathing , angry glare

 and plunged its scorching legions in the deep

 saying his wanton sight bred his unrest

 my heart avows mine eye let in the fire

 mine eye replies my greedy heart 's desire

how should i sing when buffeting salt waves 
 and stung with bitter surges , in whose might 
 i toss , a cockleshell ? the dreadful night 
 marshals its undefeated dark and raves 
 in brutal madness , reeling over graves 
 of vanquished men , long sunken out of sight 
 sent wailing down to glut the ghoulish sprite 
 who haunts foul seaweed forests and their caves 
 no parting cloud reveals a watery star 
 my cries are washed away upon the wind 
 my cramped and blistering hands can find no spar 
 my eyes with hope o'erstrained , are growing blind 
 but painted on the sky great visions burn 
 my voice , oblation from a shattered urn 

clarkson ! it was an obstinate hill to climb 
 how toilsome , nay how dire it was , by thee 
 is known ,— by none , perhaps , so feelingly 
 but thou , who , starting in thy fervent prime 
 didst first lead forth this pilgrimage sublime 
 hast heard the constant voice its charge repeat 
 which , out of thy young heart 's oracular seat 
 first roused thee .— o true yoke fellow of time 
 with unabating effort , see , the palm 
 is won , and by all nations shall be worn 
 the bloody writing is for ever torn 
 and thou henceforth shalt have a good man 's calm 
 a great man 's happiness ; thy zeal shall find 
 repose at length , firm friend of human kind 

then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes 
 and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he 
 remembered in what a haughtier guise 
 he had flung an alms to leprosie 
 when he girt his young life up in gilded mail 
 and set forth in search of the holy grail 
 the heart within him was ashes and dust 
 he parted in twain his single crust 
 he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink 
 and gave the leper to eat and drink 
 ‘ twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread 
 ‘ twas water out of a wooden bowl 
 yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed 
 and ‘ twas red wine he drank with his thirsty soul 

‘ twill grieve me more than if thou didst disdain me 
 that i should die ; and thou , because i die so 
 and yet to die , it should not know to pain me 
 if cruel beauty were content to bid so 
 death to my life , life to my long despair 
 prolonged by her , given to my love and days 
 are means to tell how truly she is fair 
 and i can die to testify her praise 
 yet not to die , though fairness me despiseth 
 is cause why in complaint i thus pers è ver 
 though death me and my love inparadiseth 
 by interdicting me from her for ever 
 i do not grieve that i am forced to die 
 but die to think upon the reason why 

of all the causes which conspire to blind 
 man 's erring judgment , and misguide the mind 
 what the weak head with strongest bias rules 
 is pride , the never failing voice of fools 
 whatever nature has in worth denied 
 she gives in large recruits of needful pride 
 for as in bodies , thus in souls , we find 
 what wants in blood and spirits , swell 'd with wind 
 pride , where wit fails , steps in to our defence 
 and fills up all the mighty void of sense 
 if once right reason drives that cloud away 
 truth breaks upon us with resistless day 
 trust not yourself ; but your defects to know 
 make use of ev'ry friend — and ev'ry foe 

oh ! might these sighs and tears return again 
 into my breast and eyes which i have spent 
 that i might , in this holy discontent 
 mourn with some fruit , as i have mourned in vain 
 in mine idolatry what showers of rain 
 mine eyes did waste ! what griefs my heart did rent 
 that sufferance was my sin i now repent 
 ‘ cause i did suffer , i must suffer pain 
 the hydroptic drunkard , and night scouting thief 
 the itchy lecher , and self tickling proud 
 have th ’ remembrance of past joys for relief 
 of coming ills . to poor me is allow 'd 
 no ease ; for long yet vehement grief hath been 
 the effect and cause , the punishment and sin 

be wise as thou art cruel , do not press 
 my tongue tied patience with too much disdain 
 lest sorrow lend me words and words express 
 the manner of my pity wanting pain 
 if i might teach thee wit better it were 
 though not to love , yet love to tell me so 
 as testy sick men when their deaths be near 
 no news but health from their physicians know 
 for if i should despair i should grow mad 
 and in my madness might speak ill of thee 
 now this ill wresting world is grown so bad 
 mad slanderers by mad ears believed be 
 that i may not be so , nor thou belied 
 bear thine eyes straight , though thy proud heart go wide 

betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took 
 and each doth good turns now unto the other 
 when that mine eye is famished for a look 
 or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother 
 with my love 's picture then my eye doth feast 
 and to the painted banquet bids my heart 
 another time mine eye is my heart 's guest 
 and in his thoughts of love doth share a part 
 so either by thy picture or my love 
 thy self away , art present still with me 
 for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move 
 and i am still with them , and they with thee 
 or if they sleep , thy picture in my sight 
 awakes my heart , to heart 's and eye 's delight 

luck to the craft that bears this name of mine 
 good fortune follow with her golden spoon 
 the glazed hat and tarry pantaloon 
 and wheresoe'er her keel shall cut the brine 
 cod , hake and haddock quarrel for her line 
 shipped with her crew , whatever wind may blow 
 or tides delay , my wish with her shall go 
 fishing by proxy . would that it might show 
 at need her course , in lack of sun and star 
 where icebergs threaten , and the sharp reefs are 
 lift the blind fog on anticosti 's lee 
 and avalon 's rock ; make populous the sea 
 round grand manan with eager finny swarms 
 break the long calms , and charm away the storms 

thine eyes i love , and they as pitying me 
 knowing thy heart torment me with disdain 
 have put on black , and loving mourners be 
 looking with pretty ruth upon my pain 
 and truly not the morning sun of heaven 
 better becomes the grey cheeks of the east 
 nor that full star that ushers in the even 
 doth half that glory to the sober west 
 as those two mourning eyes become thy face 
 o let it then as well beseem thy heart 
 to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace 
 and suit thy pity like in every part 
 then will i swear beauty herself is black 
 and all they foul that thy complexion lack 

it hath been heretofore my chance to see 
 horsemen with martial order shifting camp 
 to onset sallying , or in muster rang 'd 
 or in retreat sometimes outstretch 'd for flight 
 light armed squadrons and fleet foragers 
 scouring thy plains , arezzo ! have i seen 
 and clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts 
 now with the sound of trumpets , now of bells 
 tabors , or signals made from castled heights 
 and with inventions multiform , our own 
 or introduc 'd from foreign land ; but ne'er 
 to such a strange recorder i beheld 
 in evolution moving , horse nor foot 
 nor ship , that tack 'd by sign from land or star 

then in her tears she slept , but sleeping sighed 
 as if that vision passed again — “ the time 
 the time is come ! ” whereat siddartha turned 
 and , lo ! the moon shone by the crab ! the stars 
 in that same silver order long foretold 
 stood ranged to say : “ this is the night !— choose thou 
 the way of greatness or the way of good 
 to reign a king of kings , or wander lone 
 crownless and homeless , that the world be helped 
 moreover , with the whispers of the gloom 
 came to his ears again that warning song 
 as when the devas spoke upon the wind 
 and surely gods were round about the place 
 watching our lord , who watched the shining stars 

birds sing and build , and nature scorns alone 
 on may 's young festival to be a widow 
 the children , too , have pleasures all their own 
 in gathering lady smocks along the meadow 
 the little brook sings loud among the pebbles 
 so very loud , that water flowers , which lie 
 where many a silver curdle boils and dribbles 
 dance too with joy as it goes singing by 
 among the pasture mole hills maidens stoop 
 to pluck the luscious marjoram for their bosoms 
 the greensward 's littered o'er with buttercups 
 and whitethorns , they are breaking down with blossoms 
 ‘ t is nature 's livery for the bonny may 
 who keeps her court , and all have holiday 

when the dread trumpet sounds , the slumbering dust 
 not unattentive to the call , shall wake 
 and every joint possess its proper place 
 with a new elegance of form unknown 
 to its first state . nor shall the conscious soul 
 mistake its partner , but , amidst the crowd 
 singling its other half , into its arms 
 shall rush with all the impatience of a man 
 that 's new come home , who having long been absent 
 with haste runs over every different room 
 in pain to see the whole . thrice happy meeting 
 nor time nor death shall part them ever more 
 ‘ tis but a night , a long and moonless night 
 we make the grave our bed , and then are gone 

what right to freedom when we are not free 
 when all the passions goad us into lust 
 when , for the worthless spoil we lick the dust 
 and while one half our people die , that we 
 may sit with peace and freedom ‘ neath our tree 
 the other gloats for plunder and for spoil 
 bustles through daylight , vexes night with toil 
 cheats , swindles , lies and steals !— shall such things be 
 endowed with such grand boons as liberty 
 brings in her train of blessings ? should we pray 
 that such as these should still maintain the sway 
 these soulless , senseless , heartless enemies 
 of all that 's good and great , of all that 's wise 
 worthy on earth , or in the eternal eyes 

not marble , nor the gilded monuments 
 of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme 
 but you shall shine more bright in these contents 
 than unswept stone , besmeared with sluttish time 
 when wasteful war shall statues overturn 
 and broils root out the work of masonry 
 nor mars his sword , nor war 's quick fire shall burn 
 the living record of your memory 
 ‘ gainst death , and all oblivious enmity 
 shall you pace forth , your praise shall still find room 
 even in the eyes of all posterity 
 that wear this world out to the ending doom 
 so till the judgment that your self arise 
 you live in this , and dwell in lovers ’ eyes 

but ah , those leaves !— it was not summer 's mouth 
 breathed such a gold upon them . and look there 
 that beech how red ! see , through its boughs , half bare 
 how low the sun lies in the mid day south 
 the sweetness is but one pined memory flown 
 back from our summer , wandering alone 
 see , see the dead leaves falling ! hear thy heart 
 which , with the year 's pulse beating swift or slow 
 takes in the changing world its changing part 
 return a sigh , an echo sad and low 
 to the faint , scarcely audible sound 
 with which the leaf goes whispering to the ground 
 o love , sad winter lieth at the door 
 behind sad winter , age — we know no more 

“ now , xanthus , æ thon , lampus , urge the chase 
 and thou , podargus ! prove thy generous race 
 be fleet , be fearless , this important day 
 and all your master ’ s well spent care repay 
 for this , high fed , in plenteous stalls ye stand 
 served with pure wheat , and by a princess ’ hand 
 for this my spouse , of great aetion ’ s line 
 so oft has steep ’ d the strengthening grain in wine 
 now swift pursue , now thunder uncontroll ’ d 
 give me to seize rich nestor ’ s shield of gold 
 from tydeus ’ shoulders strip the costly load 
 vulcanian arms , the labour of a god 
 these if we gain , then victory , ye powers 
 this night , this glorious night , the fleet is ours 

brown hills long parched , long lifting to the blue 
 of summer 's brilliant sky but russet hue 
 of sere grass shivering in the trade wind 's sweep 
 soon , with light footfalls , from their tranced sleep 
 the first rains bid the poppies rise anew 
 and trills the lark exultant summons , too 
 how swift at fancy 's beck those gay crowds leap 
 to glowing life ! the eager green leaves creep 
 for welcome first ; then hooded buds , pale gold 
 each tender shower and sun kiss help unfold 
 till smiling hosts crowd all the fields , and still 
 a yellow sea of poppies breasts each hill 
 and breaks in joyous floods as children hold 
 glad hands the lavish cups as gladly fill 

his speech the tempest of her grief restored 
 in all he told she recognized her lord 
 but when the storm was spent in plenteous showers 
 a pause inspiriting her languish 'd powers 
 “ o thou , ( she cried ,) whom first inclement fate 
 made welcome to my hospitable gate 
 with all thy wants the name of poor shall end 
 henceforth live honour 'd , my domestic friend 
 the vest much envied on your native coast 
 and regal robe with figured gold emboss 'd 
 in happier hours my artful hand employ 'd 
 when my loved lord this blissful bower enjoy 'd 
 the fall of troy erroneous and forlorn 
 doom 'd to survive , and never to return 

them virgil answer 'd . “ ye suppose perchance 
 us well acquainted with this place : but here 
 we , as yourselves , are strangers . not long erst 
 we came , before you but a little space 
 by other road so rough and hard , that now 
 the ’ ascent will seem to us as play . ” the spirits 
 who from my breathing had perceiv 'd i liv 'd 
 grew pale with wonder . as the multitude 
 flock round a herald , sent with olive branch 
 to hear what news he brings , and in their haste 
 tread one another down , e'en so at sight 
 of me those happy spirits were fix 'd , each one 
 forgetful of its errand , to depart 
 where cleans 'd from sin , it might be made all fair 

and should the twilight darken into night 
 and sorrow grow to anguish , be thou strong 
 thou art in god , and nothing can go wrong 
 which a fresh life pulse cannot set aright 
 that thou dost know the darkness , proves the light 
 weep if thou wilt , but weep not all too long 
 or weep and work , for work will lead to song 
 but search thy heart , if , hid from all thy sight 
 there lies no cause for beauty 's slow decay 
 if for completeness and diviner youth 
 and not for very love , thou seek'st the truth 
 if thou hast learned to give thyself away 
 for love 's own self , not for thyself , i say 
 were god 's love less , the world were lost , in sooth 

from records true my legends i rehearse 
 and string the pearls of wisdom in my verse 
 that in the glimmering days of life 's decline 
 its fruits , in wealth and honor , may be mine 
 my verse , a structure pointing to the skies 
 whose solid strength destroying time defies 
 all praise the noble work , save only those 
 of impious life , or base malignant foes 
 all blest with learning read , and read again 
 the sovereign smiles , and thus approves my strain 
 “ richer by far , firdusi , than a mine 
 of precious gems , is this bright lay of thine 
 centuries may pass away , but still my page 
 will be the boast of each succeeding age 

pregnant with possibilities of crime 
 and full of felons for all coming time 
 your blood 's too precious to be lightly spilt 
 in testimony to a venial guilt 
 live to get whelpage and preserve a name 
 no praise can sweeten and no lie unshame 
 live to fulfill the vision that i see 
 down the dim vistas of the time to be 
 a dream of clattering beaks and burning eyes 
 of hungry ravens glooming all the skies 
 a dream of gleaming teeth and foetid breath 
 of jackals wrangling at the feast of death 
 a dream of broken necks and swollen tongues 
 the whole world 's gibbets loaded with de youngs 

it is not death which wretched men call dying 
 but that is very death which i endure 
 when my coy looking nymph , her grace envying 
 by fatal frowns my domage doth procure 
 it is not life which we for life approve 
 but that is life when on her wool soft paps 
 i seal sweet kisses which do batten love 
 and doubling them do treble my good haps 
 ‘ tis neither love the son , nor love the mother 
 which lovers praise and pray to ; but that love is 
 which she in eye and i in heart do smother 
 then muse not though i glory in my miss 
 since she who holds my heart and me in durance 
 hath life , death , love and all in her procurance 

xv . as he that parts in hatred from a friend 
 mixing with other men forgets the woe 
 which anguished him when he beheld and lo 
 two souls had fled asunder which did bend 
 under the same blue heaven ! yet ere the end 
 when the loud world hath tossed him to and fro 
 will often strangely reappear that glow 
 at simplest memory which some chance may send 
 although much stronger bonds have lost their power 
 so thou god sent didst come in lowly guise 
 striking on simple chords ,— not with surprise 
 or mightiest recollectings in that hour 
 but like remembered fragrance of a flower 
 a man with human heart and loving eyes 

we lack , yet cannot fix upon the lack 
 not this , nor that ; yet somewhat , certainly 
 we see the things we do not yearn to see 
 around us : and what see we glancing back 
 lost hopes that leave our hearts upon the rack 
 hopes that were never ours yet seemed to be 
 for which we steered on life 's salt stormy sea 
 braving the sunstroke and the frozen pack 
 if thus to look behind is all in vain 
 and all in vain to look to left or right 
 why face we not our future once again 
 launching with hardier hearts across the main 
 straining dim eyes to catch the invisible sight 
 and strong to bear ourselves in patient pain 

o gracious mother , whose benignant breast 
 wakes us to life , and lulls us all to rest 
 how thy sweet features , kind to every clime 
 mock with their smile the wrinkled front of time 
 we stain thy flowers ,— they blossom o'er the dead 
 we rend thy bosom , and it gives us bread 
 o'er the red field that trampling strife has torn 
 waves the green plumage of thy tasselled corn 
 our maddening conflicts sear thy fairest plain 
 still thy soft answer is the growing grain 
 yet , o our mother , while uncounted charms 
 steal round our hearts in thine embracing arms 
 let not our virtues in thy love decay 
 and thy fond sweetness waste our strength away 

when comes the lighted day for men to read 
 life 's meaning , with the work before their hands 
 till this good gift of breath from debt is freed 
 earth will not hear her children 's wailful bands 
 deplore the chieftain fall'n in sob and dirge 
 nor they look where is darkness , but on high 
 the sun that dropped down our horizon 's verge 
 illumes his labours through the travelled sky 
 now seen in sum , most glorious ; and ‘ tis known 
 by what our warrior wrought we hold him fast 
 a splendid image built of man has flown 
 his deeds inspired of god outstep a past

 among us who celestial tasks has done 

he spoke ; the goddess with the charming eyes 
 glows with celestial red , and thus replies 
 “ is this a scene for love ? on ida ’ s height 
 exposed to mortal and immortal sight 
 our joys profaned by each familiar eye 
 the sport of heaven , and fable of the sky 
 how shall i e ’ er review the blest abodes 
 or mix among the senate of the gods

the husband quite astonished now appeared 
 at once a hundred diff'rent ills he feared 
 but questioning his wife howe'er , he found 
 that many other dames who lived around 
 like her ; in paying tithes , the monks obeyed 
 which consolation to his breast conveyed 
 poor innocent ! she nothing wished to hide 
 said she , not one but tithe they make provide

he said , and with the pliant lash he touch 'd 
 the sleek skinn 'd horses ; springing at the sound 
 between the greeks and trojans , light they bore 
 the flying car , o'er bodies of the slain 
 and broken bucklers trampling ; all beneath 
 was plash 'd with blood the axle , and the rails 
 around the car , as from the horses ’ feet 
 and from the felloes of the wheels , were thrown 
 the bloody gouts ; yet on he sped , to join 
 the strife of men , and break th ’ opposing ranks 
 his coming spread confusion ‘ mid the greeks 
 his spear awhile withheld ; then through the rest 
 with sword , and spear , and pond'rous stones he rush 'd 
 but shunn 'd the might of ajax telamon 

dame fortune often loves a laugh to raise 
 and , playing off her tricks and roguish ways 
 instead of giving us what we desire 
 mere quid pro quo permits us to acquire 
 i 've found her gambols such from first to last 
 and judge the future by experience past 
 fair cloris and myself felt mutual flame 
 and , when a year had run , the sprightly dame 
 prepared to grant me , if i may be plain 
 some slight concessions that would ease my pain 
 this was her aim ; but whatsoe'er in view 
 ‘ tis opportunity we should pursue 
 the lover , who 's discreet , will moments seize 
 and ev'ry effort then will tend to please 

at threescore years and five aroused anew 
 to rule in india , forth a soldier went 
 on whose bright fronted youth fierce war had spent 
 its iron stress of storm , till glory grew 
 full as the red sun waned on waterloo 
 landing , he met the word from england sent 
 which bade him yield up rule : and he , content 
 resigned it , as a mightier warrior 's due 
 and wrote as one rejoicing to record 
 that “ from the first ” his royal heart was lord 
 of its own pride or pain ; that thought was none 
 therein save this , that in her perilous strait 
 england , whose womb brings forth her sons so great 
 should choose to serve her first her mightiest son 

“ so sang the nautch girl to the pipe and wires 
 fluttering like some vain , painted butterfly 
 from glade to glade along the forest path 
 nor dreamed her light words echoed on the ear 
 of him , that holy man , who sate so rapt 
 under the fig tree by the path . but buddh 
 lifted his great brow as the wantons passed 
 and spake : ‘ the foolish ofttimes teach the wise 
 i strain too much this string of life , belike 
 meaning to make such music as shall save 
 mine eyes are dim now that they see the truth 
 my strength is waned now that my need is most 
 would that i had such help as man must have 
 for i shall die , whose life was all men 's hope 

sole lord of lords and very king of kings 
 he sits within the desert , carved in stone 
 inscrutable , colossal , and alone 
 and ancienter than memory of things 
 graved on his front the sacred beetle clings 
 disdain sits on his lips ; and in a frown 
 scorn lives upon his forehead for a crown 
 the affrighted ostrich dare not dust her wings 
 anear this presence . the long caravan 's 
 dazed camels stop , and mute the bedouins stare 
 this symbol of past power more than man 's 
 presages doom . kings look — and kings despair 
 their sceptres tremble in their jewelled hands 
 and dark thrones totter in the baleful air 

they swept up much , they shovelled up more 
 there never was such a snow man before 
 they built him bravely with might and main 
 there never will be such a snow man again 
 his legs were big , his body was bigger 
 they made him a most imposing figure 
 his eyes were large and as black as coal 
 for a cinder was placed in each round hole 
 and the sight of his teeth would have made yours ache 
 being simply the teeth of an ancient rake 
 they smoothed his forehead , they patted his back 
 there was n't a single unsightly crack 
 and when they had given the final pat 
 they crowned his head with the scare crow 's hat 

there 's nothing i know of to make you spend 
 a day of your life at cragwell end 
 it 's a village quiet and grey and old 
 a little village tucked into a fold 
 ( a sort of valley , not over wide 
 of the hills that flank it on either side 
 there 's a large grey church with a square stone tower 
 and a clock to mark you the passing hour 
 in a chime that shivers the village calm 
 with a few odd bits of the 100th psalm 
 a red brick vicarage stands thereby 
 breathing comfort and lapped in ease 
 with a row of elms thick trunked and high 
 and a bevy of rooks to caw in these 

in summers day , when phoebus fairly shone 
 i saw a bull as white as driven snowe 
 with gilden homes embowed like the moone 
 in a fresh flowring meadow lying lowe 
 up to his eares the verdant grasse did growe 
 and the gay floures did offer to be eaten 
 but he with fatnes so did overflows 
 that he all wallowed in the weedes downe beaten 
 ne car 'd with them his daintie lips to sweeten 
 till that a brize *, a scorned little creature 
 through his faire hide his angrie sting did threaten 
 and vext so sore , that all his goodly feature 
 and all his plenteous pasture nought him pleased 
 so by the small the great is oft diseased 

that lady of all gentle memories 
 had lighted on my soul ; whose new abode 
 lies now , as it was well ordained of god 
 among the poor in heart where mary is 
 love , knowing that dear image to be his 
 woke up within the sick heart sorrow bowed 
 unto the sighs which are its weary load 
 saying , “ go forth . ” and they went forth , i wis 
 forth went they from my breast that throbbed and ached 
 with such a pang as oftentimes will bathe 
 mine eyes with tears when i am left alone 
 and still those sighs which drew the heaviest breath 
 came whispering thus : “ o noble intellect 
 it is a year to day that thou art gone 

there where the ash pale forest leaves were touched 
 by morning 's shining fingers , and the inland depths 
 sent out rain plenished voices west and south 
 the steel clad scouts of esarhaddon came 
 and searched , and found manasseh whom they bound 
 and dragged before the swart assyrian king 
 and esarhaddon , scourge of heaven , sent 
 to strange evil at its chiefest fanes 
 and so fulfil a dread divine decree 
 took judah 's despot , fettered hand and foot 
 and cast him bleeding on a dungeon floor 
 hard by where swift euphrates chafes his brink 
 and gleams from cataract to cataract 
 and gives the gale a deep midwinter tone 

had she not been so excellently fair 
 my muse had never mourned in lines of woe 
 but i did too inestimable weigh her 
 and that 's the cause i now lament me so 
 yet not for her contempt do i complain me 
 complaints may ease the mind , but that is all 
 therefore though she too constantly disdain me 
 i can but sigh and grieve , and so i shall 
 yet grieve i not because i must grieve ever 
 and yet , alas , waste tears away , in vain 
 i am resolv è d truly to pers è ver 
 though she persisteth in her old disdain 
 but that which grieves me most is that i see

by four fond swains in playful circles drawn 
 on glowing wheels she tracks the moon bright lawn 
 mounts the rude cliff , unveils her blushing charms 
 230 and calls the panting zephyrs to her arms 
 emerged from ocean springs the vaporous air 
 bathes her light limbs , uncurls her amber hair 
 incrusts her beamy form with films saline 
 and beauty blazes through the crystal shrine

fair was the maid , and lovely as the morn 
 from starry night and rosy twilight born 
 within whose mind a rivulet of song 
 rehearsed the strains that from her lips ere long 
 welled free and sparkling , as the vocal woods 
 repeat the day spring 's sweetest interludes 
 her gentle eyes ’ serenest depths of blue 
 shrined love and truth , and all their retinue 
 the health and beauty of her youthful face 
 made it the harem of each maiden grace 
 and such perfection blended with her air 
 she seemed some stately goddess moving there 
 beholding her , you thought she might have been 
 the long lost , flower loving proserpine 

a remnant from the pitiless strife escaped 
 entered their stronghold , scarce eluding doom 
 children and wives from their limbs blood besprent 
 received their arms bedabbled with foul gore 
 and baths for all were heated . leeches ran 
 through all the town in hot haste to the homes 
 of wounded men to minister to their hurts 
 here wives and daughters moaned round men come back 
 from war , there cried on many who came not 
 here , men stung to the soul by bitter pangs 
 groaned upon beds of pain ; there , toil spent men 
 turned them to supper . whinnied the swift steeds 
 and neighed o'er mangers heaped . by tent and ship 
 far off the greeks did even as they of troy

 sleeping by day , or sometimes worked upon 
 his flint head arrows and his knives of stone 
 by night stole forth and slew the savage boar 
 so that he loomed a hunter of loud fame 
 and many a skin of wolf and wild cat wore 
 and counted many a flint head to his name 
 wherefore he walked the envy of the band 
 hated and feared , but matchless in his skill 
 till lo ! one night deep in that shaggy land 
 he tracked a yearling bear and made his kill 
 then over worn he rested by a stream 
 and sank into a sleep too deep for dream 

what hopes , what terrors , does this gift create 
 ambiguous emblem of uncertain fate 
 the myrtle ( ensign of supreme command 
 consign 'd to venus by melissa 's hand 
 not less capricious than a reigning fair 
 oft favours , oft rejects a lover 's prayer 
 in myrtle shades oft sings the happy swain 
 in myrtle shades despairing ghosts complain 
 the myrtle crowns the happy lovers ’ heads 
 the unhappy lovers ’ graves the myrtle spreads 
 oh ! then , the meaning of thy gift impart 
 and ease the throbbings of an anxious heart 
 soon must this sprig , as you shall fix its doom 
 adorn philander 's head , or grace his tomb 

thou in whose all no work imperfect stands 
 thou who dost gaze on beauty 's unveiled face 
 grant to thy children thy sustaining grace 
 when low at length have run the daylight sands 
 when , though their day was set to thy commands 
 they bow contritely in prayer 's holy place 
 because through strivings beauty wards they trace 
 the sad misshapings of their earthly hands 
 grant them at eve a soul devoutly still 
 grant them in dreams a vision of thy light 
 grant them at morn a sorrow purged away 
 into the peace of all absolving night 
 star in the dawnlight of a fairer day 
 nearer the blossom of thy perfect will 

here from this summit where i often roam 
 i can behold my cot , my humble home 
 there i was born , and when this life is o'er 
 i hope to sleep upon the river 's shore 
 there is the orchard which i helped to rear 
 it well repays my labor year by year 
 one apple tree towers high above the rest 
 where every spring a blackbird has its nest 
 sweet lily used to stand beneath the bough 
 and smiling listen — but she comes not now 
 a fairer bird ne'er charmed the rising day 
 than she we loved thus early called away 
 but she is gone to sing her holy strains 
 in lovelier gardens and on greener plains 

ah wherefore with infection should he live 
 and with his presence grace impiety 
 that sin by him advantage should achieve 
 and lace it self with his society 
 why should false painting imitate his cheek 
 and steal dead seeming of his living hue 
 why should poor beauty indirectly seek 
 roses of shadow , since his rose is true 
 why should he live , now nature bankrupt is 
 beggared of blood to blush through lively veins 
 for she hath no exchequer now but his 
 and proud of many , lives upon his gains 
 o him she stores , to show what wealth she had 
 in days long since , before these last so bad 

on ! leave the past to bury its own dead 
 the past is naught to us , the present all 
 what need of last year 's leaves to strew love 's bed 
 what need of ghosts to grace a festival 
 i would not , if i could , those days recall 
 those days not ours . for us the feast is spread 
 the lamps are lit , and music plays withal 
 then let us love and leave the rest unsaid 
 this island is our home . around it roar 
 great gulfs and oceans , channels , straits and seas 
 what matter in what wreck we reached the shore 
 so we both reached it ? we can mock at these 
 oh leave the past , if past indeed there be 
 i would not know it ; i would know but thee 

still came the multitudes , and still the sea 
 of human souls surged round the iron base 
 of that mysterious mountain , while afar 
 the dim circumference was added to 
 with newer legions . conquerors of old 
 armored and visored in resplendent steel 
 galloped on hell steeds , that with one great bound 
 cleared bottomless ca ñ ons ; then the kings and queens 
 of babylon , shorn of their lofty state 
 came abject , and with terror in those eyes 
 that once outshone the world ; and after them 
 myriads who reveled at the feast of life 
 and when the reeling stupor of their wine 
 had loosened , woke and found their souls in hell 

he kept his secret ; but the seed of crime 
 bursts of itself in god 's appointed time 
 the lives he wrecked were scattered far and wide 
 one never blamed nor wept ,— she only died 
 none knew his lot , though idle tongues would say 
 he sought a lonely refuge far away 
 and there , with borrowed name and altered mien 
 he died unheeded , as he lived unseen 
 the moral market had the usual chills 
 of virtue suffering from protested bills 
 the white cravats , to friendship 's memory true 
 sighed for the past , surveyed the future too 
 their sorrow breathed in one expressive line 
 “ gave pleasant dinners ; who has got his wine 

an arid daylight shines along the beach 
 dried to a grey monotony of tone 
 and stranded jelly fish melt soft upon 
 the sun baked pebbles , far beyond their reach 
 sparkles a wet , reviving sea . here bleach 
 the skeletons of fishes , every bone 
 polished and stark , like traceries of stone 
 the joints and knuckles hardened each to each 
 and they are dead while waiting for the sea 
 the moon pursuing sea , to come again 
 their hearts are blown away on the hot breeze 
 only the shells and stones can wait to be 
 washed bright . for living things , who suffer pain 
 may not endure till time can bring them ease 

by the dead body of hope , the spotless lamb 
 thou threwest into the high priest 's slaughtering room 
 and by the child despair born red therefrom 
 as , thank the secret sire picked out to cram 
 with spurious spawn thy misconceiving dam 
 thou , like a worm from a town 's common tomb 
 didst creep from forth the kennel of her womb 
 born to break down with catapult and ram 
 man 's builded towers of promise , and with breath 
 and tongue to track and hunt his hopes to death 
 o , by that sweet dead body abused and slain 
 and by that child mismothered ,— dog , by all 
 thy curses thou hast cursed mankind withal 
 with what curse shall man curse thee back again 

i wage the combat with two mighty foes 
 which are more strong than i ten thousand fold 
 the one is when thy pleasure i do lose 
 the other , when thy person i behold 
 in seeing thee a swarm of loves confound me 
 and cause my death in spite of my resist 
 and if i see thee not , thy want doth wound me 
 for in thy sight my comfort doth consist 
 the one in me continual care createth 
 the other doth occasion my desire 
 the one the edge of all my joy rebateth 
 the other makes me a phoenix in love 's fire 
 so that i grieve when i enjoy your presence 
 and die for grief by reason of your absence 

fair by inheritance , whom born we see 
 both in the wondrous year and on the day 
 wherein the fairest planet beareth sway 
 the heavens to thee this fortune doth decree 
 thou of a world of hearts in time shall be 
 a monarch great , and with one beauty 's ray 
 so many hosts of hearts thy face shall slay 
 as all the rest for love shall yield to thee 
 but even as alexander when he knew 
 his father 's conquests wept , lest he should leave 
 no kingdom unto him for to subdue 
 so shall thy mother thee of praise bereave 
 so many hearts already she hath slain 
 as few behind to conquer shall remain 

he looked half parson and half skipper : a quaint 
 beautiful blend , with blue eyes good to see 
 and old world whiskers . you found him cynic , saint 
 salt , humourist , christian , poet ; with a free 
 far glancing , luminous utterance ; and a heart 
 large as st. francis 's : withal a brain 
 stored with experience , letters , fancy , art 
 and scored with runes of human joy and pain 
 till six and sixty years he used his gift 
 his gift unparalleled , of laughter and tears 
 and left the world a high piled , golden drift 
 of verse : to grow more golden with the years 
 till the great silence fallen upon his ways 
 break into song , and he that had love have praise 

old joe is gone , who saw hot percy goad 
 his slow artillery up the concord road 
 a tale which grew in wonder year by year 
 as every time he told it , joe drew near 
 to the main fight , till faded and grown gray 
 the original scene to bolder tints gave way 
 then joe had heard the foe 's scared double quick 
 beat on stove drum with one uncaptured stick 
 and , ere death came the lengthening tale to lop 
 himself had fired , and seen a red coat drop 
 had joe lived long enough , that scrambling fight 
 had squared more nearly to his sense of right 
 and vanquished perry , to complete the tale 
 had hammered stone for life in concord jail 

but the rest fired the tents , wherein erewhile 
 they slept , and sailed the wide sea in their ships 
 two mighty hearted captains ordered these 
 nestor and agamemnon lord of spears 
 fain had they also entered that great horse 
 but all the host withheld them , bidding stay 
 with them a shipboard , ordering their array 
 for men far better work the works of war 
 when their kings oversee them ; therefore these 
 abode without , albeit mighty men 
 so came they swiftly unto tenedos ’ shore 
 and dropped the anchor stones , then leapt in haste 
 forth of the ships , and silent waited there 
 keen watching till the signal torch should flash 

batter my heart , three person 'd god , for you

 labour to admit you , but oh ! to no end

 but is captived , and proves weak or untrue

 but am betrothed unto your enemy

with how sad steps , o moon ! thou climb'st the skies 
 how silently , and with how wan a face 
 what ! may it be , that even in heavenly place 
 that busy archer his sharp arrows tries

so late in autumn half the world 's asleep 
 and half the wakeful world looks pinched and pale 
 for dampness now , not freshness , rides the gale 
 and cold and colorless comes ashore the deep 
 with tides that bluster or with tides that creep 
 now veiled uncouthness wears an uncouth veil 
 of fog , not sultry haze ; and blight and bale 
 have done their worst , and leaves rot on the heap 
 so late in autumn one forgets the spring 
 forgets the summer with its opulence 
 the callow birds that long have found a wing 
 the swallows that more lately gat them hence 
 will anything like spring , will anything 
 like summer , rouse one day the slumbering sense 

nay , thou hast lost them both , ” the fisher said 
 and as he spoke a wondrous light was shed 
 around his form ; he dropped his garments mean 
 and in his place the river god was seen 
 “ thy vanity hast brought thee in my power 
 “ and thou shalt pay the forfeit at this hour 
 “ for thou hast shown thyself a royal fool 
 “ too proud to angle , and too vain to rule 
 “ eager to win in every trivial strife 
 “ go ! thou shalt fish for minnows all thy life

no other choice belphegor now had got 
 than — try himself the hymeneal knot

a shady nook where nought is overheard 
 but wind among the eucalyptus leaves 
 the cheery chirp of interflitting bird 
 or wooden squeak of tree frog as it grieves 
 the resting eye broods o'er the running grass 
 or nodding gestures of the bowed wild oats 
 watches the oleander lancers pass 
 and the bright flashing of the oriole notes 
 hushed are the senses with the drone of bees 
 and the far glimmer of the mid day heat 
 dreams stealing o'er one like the incoming seas 
 soft as the rustling zephyrs in the wheat 
 while on the breeze is borne the call of love 
 to love , dear love , of majel , the wild dove

among the lonely lakes i go no more 
 for she who made their beauty is not there 
 the paleface rears his tepee on the shore 
 and says the vale is fairest of the fair 
 full many years have vanished since , but still 
 the voyageurs beside the campfire tell 
 how , when the moonrise tips the distant hill 
 they hear strange voices through the silence swell 
 the paleface loves the haunted lakes they say 
 and journeys far to watch their beauty spread 
 before his vision ; but to me the day 
 the night , the hour , the seasons are all dead 
 i listen heartsick , while the hunters tell 
 why white men named the valley the qu'appelle 

in secret they , the pleasing task pursue 
 but soon — ( what can escape a lovers view

 the crews on board announced , the fleet prepar 'd

 distracted , furious , o'er the town she flies 
 wild as the woodnymph when the frantic rite 
 and bacchanalian shout , to rage excite

“ but when the gods , frustrated , this beheld 
 how , living still , among the dead she dwelled 
 because she lived in him whose life she won 
 and her blood beat in his beneath the sun 
 they reasoned : ‘ when the bitter stygian wave 
 the sweetness of love 's kisses cannot lave 
 when the pale flood of lethe washes not 
 from mortal mind one high immortal thought 
 akin to us the earthly creature grows 
 since nature suffers only what it knows 
 if she whom we to this grey desert banned 
 still dreams she treads with him the sunlit land 
 that for his sake she left without a tear 
 set wide the gates — her being is not here 

great men have been among us ; hands that penn 'd 
 and tongues that utter 'd wisdom , better none 
 the later sydney , marvel , harrington 
 young vane , and others who call 'd milton friend

so oft as i her beauty doe behold 
 and therewith doe her cruelty compare 
 i marvaile of what substance was the mould 
 the which her made attonce so cruell faire 
 not earth ; for her high thoughts more heavenly are 
 not water ; for her love doth burne like fyre

order is heaven 's first law : and , this confest

 that such are happier , shocks all common sense

sleep sent his angels forth ; with silent tread 
 from house to house , they on their mission sped 
 watched by the couch of suffering and pain 
 soothed the pale brow and calmed the throbbing brain 
 eased the sad heart and closed the weeping eye 
 bade care and grief with their attendants fly 
 entered the chamber of the rich and great 
 nor scorned to visit those of mean estate 
 but blessed alike the lofty and the low 
 alike bade each forget their weight of woe 
 the proud and wealthy drew around their breast 
 “ the curtains of repose , ” and sank to rest 
 the pallid sons of want and hunger slept 
 and sorrow 's sons forgot that they had wept 

on other shores , above their mouldering towns 
 in sullen pomp the tall cathedral frowns 
 pride in its aisles and paupers at the door 
 which feeds the beggars whom it fleeced of yore 
 simple and frail , our lowly temples throw 
 their slender shadows on the paths below 
 scarce steal the winds , that sweep his woodland tracks 
 the larch 's perfume from the settler 's axe 
 ere , like a vision of the morning air 
 his slight — framed steeple marks the house of prayer 
 its planks all reeking and its paint undried 
 its rafters sprouting on the shady side 
 it sheds the raindrops from its shingled eaves 
 ere its green brothers once have changed their leaves 

where lies the land to which yon ship must go 
 festively she puts forth in trim array 
 as vigorous as a lark at break of day 
 is she for tropic suns , or polar snow 
 what boots the enquiry ? neither friend nor foe 
 she cares for ; let her travel where she may 
 she finds familiar names , a beaten way 
 ever before her , and a wind to blow 
 yet still i ask , what haven is her mark 
 and , almost as it was when ships were rare 
 from time to time , like pilgrims , here and there 
 crossing the waters ; doubt , and something dark 
 of the old sea some reverential fear 
 is with me at thy farewell , joyous bark 

the midnight is not more bewildering 
 to her drowsed eyes , than to her ears , the sound 
 of dim , sweet singing voices , interwound 
 with purl of flute and subtle twang of string 
 strained through the lattice , where the roses cling 
 and , with their fragrance , waft the notes around 
 her haunted senses . thirsting beyond bound 
 of her slow yielding dreams , the lilt and swing 
 of the mysterious delirious tune 
 she drains like some strange opiate , with awed eyes 
 upraised against her casement , where aswoon 
 the stars fail from her sight , and up the skies 
 of alien azure rolls the full round moon 
 like some vast bubble blown of summer noon 

so saying , she bethought her suddenly 
 or feigned to have bethought her suddenly 
 how she had left the lute that afternoon 
 lying upon an arbour seat , when she 
 grew tired of fingering the strings of it 
 down in the garden , where she wont to walk 
 her lute loquacious to the trees ’ deaf trunks 
 and angelo , right glad to render her 
 such little graceful offices of love 
 and gladder yet with hope to hear her sing 
 who had denied his asking many a time 
 awaited not another word , but rose 
 and said , “ myself will bring it , ” and before 
 she could assent or disapprove , was gone

 with his delights , for when tired out with fun 
 he rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed

 has wrought a silence , from the stove there shrills 
 the cricket 's song , in warmth increasing ever 
 and seems to one in drowsiness half lost

 hath put a spirit of youth in every thing 
 that heavy saturn laughed and leaped with him 
 yet nor the lays of birds , nor the sweet smell 
 of different flowers in odour and in hue 
 could make me any summer 's story tell 
 or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew 
 nor did i wonder at the lily 's white 
 nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose 
 they were but sweet , but figures of delight 
 drawn after you , you pattern of all those 
 yet seemed it winter still , and you away 
 as with your shadow i with these did play 

fair isle , that from the fairest of all flowers 
 thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take 
 how many memories of what radiant hours 
 at sight of thee and thine at once awake 
 how many scenes of what departed bliss 
 how many thoughts of what entombed hopes 
 how many visions of a maiden that is 
 no more — no more upon thy verdant slopes 
 no more ! alas , that magical sad sound 
 transfomring all ! thy charms shall please no more 
 thy memory no more ! accursed ground 
 henceforth i hold thy flower enamelled shore 
 o hyacinthine isle ! o purple zante 
 “ isoa d'oro ! fior di levante 

look , how the flower which ling'ringly doth fade 
 the morning 's darling late , the summer 's queen 
 spoil 'd of that juice which kept it fresh and green 
 as high as it did raise , bows low the head 
 right so the pleasures of my life being dead 
 or in their contraries but only seen 
 with swifter speed declines than erst it spread 
 and , blasted , scarce now shows what it hath been 
 as doth the pilgrim , therefore , whom the night 
 by darkness would imprison on his way 
 think on thy home , my soul , and think aright 
 of what 's yet left thee of life 's wasting day 
 thy sun posts westward , passed is thy morn 
 and twice it is not given thee to be born 

cruel fair love , i justly do complain 
 of too much rigor and thy heart unkind 
 that for mine eyes thou hast my body slain 
 and would not grant that i should favour find 
 i looked , fair love , and you my love looked fair 
 i sighed for love and you for sport did smile 
 your smiles were such as did perfume the air 
 and this perfum è d did my heart beguile 
 thus i confess the fault was in mine eyes 
 begun with sighs and ended with a flame 
 i for your love did all the world despise 
 and in these poems honored have your name 
 then let your love so with my fault dispense 
 that all my parts feel not mine eyes ’ offense

robert of sicily , brother of pope urbane 
 and valmond , emperor of allemaine 
 despoiled of his magnificent attire 
 bare headed , breathless , and besprent with mire 
 with sense of wrong and outrage desperate 
 strode on and thundered at the palace gate 
 rushed through the court yard , thrusting in his rage 
 to right and left each seneschal and page 
 and hurried up the broad and sounding stair 
 his white face ghastly in the torches ’ glare 
 from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed 
 voices and cries he heard , but did not heed 
 until at last he reached the banquet — room 
 blazing with light , and breathing with perfume 

at length a wedding much attention caught 
 the lads and lasses of the hamlet sought 
 to see the couple pass : the belle perceived 
 the very man for whom her bosom heaved 
 and loudly cried , behold scamander 's flood 
 which raised surprise ; soon numbers round her stood 
 astonishment expressed , but still the fair 
 whate'er was asked , would nothing more declare 
 than , in the spacious , blue , ethereal sky 
 her marriage would be soon , they might rely 
 a laugh prevailed ; for what was to be done 
 the god with hasty steps away had run 
 and none with stones pursued his rapid flight 
 the deity was quickly ought of sight 

let the sublimer muse , who , wrapp 'd in night 
 rides on the raven pennons of the storm 
 or o'er the field , with purple havoc warm 
 lashes her steeds , and sings along the fight 
 let her , whom more ferocious strains delight 
 disdain the plaintive sonnet 's little form 
 and scorn to its wild cadence to conform 
 the impetuous tenor of her hardy flight 
 but me , far lowest of the sylvan train 
 who wake the wood nymphs from the forest shade 
 with wildest song ;— me , much behoves thy aid 
 of mingled melody , to grace my strain 
 and give it power to please , as soft it flows 
 through the smooth murmurs of thy frequent close 

mother whose womb brought forth our man of men 
 mother of shakespeare , whom all time acclaims 
 queen therefore , sovereign queen of english dames 
 throned higher than sat thy sonless empress then 
 was it thy son 's young passion guided pen 
 which drew , reflected from encircling flames 
 a figure marked by the earlier of thy names 
 wife , and from all her wedded kinswomen 
 marked by the sign of murderess ? pale and great 
 great in her grief and sin , but in her death 
 and anguish of her penitential breath 
 greater than all her sin or sin born fate 
 she stands , the holocaust of dark desire 
 clothed round with song for ever as with fire 

these words were utter 'd in a pensive mood 
 even while mine eyes were on that solemn sight 
 a contrast and reproach to gross delight 
 and life 's unspiritual pleasures daily woo 'd 
 but now upon this thought i cannot brood 
 it is unstable , and deserts me quite 
 nor will i praise a cloud , however bright 
 disparaging man 's gifts , and proper food 
 the grove , the sky built temple , and the dome 
 though clad in colours beautiful and pure 
 find in the heart of man no natural home 
 the immortal mind craves objects that endure 
 these cleave to it ; from these it cannot roam 
 nor they from it : their fellowship is secure 

a ladder , which my ken pursued in vain 
 so lofty was the summit ; down whose steps 
 i saw the splendours in such multitude 
 descending , ev'ry light in heav'n , methought 
 was shed thence . as the rooks , at dawn of day 
 bestirring them to dry their feathers chill 
 some speed their way a field , and homeward some 
 returning , cross their flight , while some abide 
 and wheel around their airy lodge ; so seem 'd 
 that glitterance , wafted on alternate wing 
 as upon certain stair it met , and clash 'd 
 its shining . and one ling'ring near us , wax 'd 
 so bright , that in my thought : said : “ the love 
 which this betokens me , admits no doubt

the maple with its tassel flowers of green 
 that turns to red a staghorn shaped seed 
 just spreading out its scolloped leaves is seen 
 of yellowish hue , yet beautifully green 
 bark ribbed like corderoy in seamy screed 
 that farther up the stem is smoother seen 
 where the white hemlock with white umbel flowers 
 up each spread stoven to the branches towers 
 and moss around the stoven spreads , dark green 
 and blotched leaved orchis , and the blue bell flowers 
 thickly they grow and neath the leaves are seen 
 i love to see them gemmed with morning hours 
 i love the lone green places where they be 
 and the sweet clothing of the maple tree 

thou whose spell can raise the dead

 his foot , in bony whiteness , glittered there 
 shrunken and sinewless , and ghastly bare

when the first larvae on the elm are seen 
 the crawling wretches , like its leaves , are green 
 ere chill october shakes the latest down 
 they , like the foliage , change their tint to brown

peace , the soul 's slumber , was round me shed 
 the sleep where thought lives , but its pain is dead 
 and my musings led me , a spirit band 
 through the wide realms of their native land 
 till i stood by the couch of the mighty dying 
 a lonely shore in the midnight lying 
 he lay as if he had laid him to sleep 
 and the stars above him their watch did keep 
 and the mournful wind with the dreamy sigh 
 the homeless wanderer of the sky 
 was the only attendant whose gentle breath 
 soothed him yet on the couch of death 
 and the dying waves of the heedless sea 
 fell at his feet most listlessly 

toward the sea turning my troubled eye 
 i saw the fish ( if fish i may it cleepe 
 that makes the sea before his face to flye 
 and with his flaggie finnes doth seeme to sweepe

 making his sport , that manie makes to weep

 that , in his throat him pricking softly under

 with fire ! god wills it in this deed . this use 
 we draw from the most impious murder done 
 since calvary . rise then , o countrymen

 the lady never made unwilling war 
 with those fine eyes : she had her pleasure in it 
 and made her good man jealous with good cause 
 and lived there neither dame nor damsel then

 not one to flirt a venom at her eyes

charles ! my slow heart was only sad , when first 
 i scanned that face of feeble infancy 
 for dimly on my thoughtful spirit burst 
 all i had been , and all my child might be 
 but when i saw it on its mother 's arm 
 and hanging at her bosom ( she the while 
 bent o'er its features with a tearful smile 
 then i was thrilled and melted , and most warm 
 impressed a father 's kiss : and all beguiled 
 of dark remembrance and presageful fear

a gentle shepherd , born in arcady 
 that well could tune his pipe , and deftly play

 and nursing him with those of his own blood

o wild west wind , thou breath of autumn 's being 
 thou , from whose unseen presence the leaves dead 
 are driven , like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing 
 yellow , and black , and pale , and hectic red 
 pestilence stricken multitudes : o thou 
 who chariotest to their dark wintry bed 
 the wing é d seeds , where they lie cold and low 
 each like a corpse within its grave , until 
 thine azure sister of the spring shall blow 
 her clarion o'er the dreaming earth , and fill

the palid thunderstricken sigh for gain 
 down an ideal stream they ever float 
 and sailing on pactolus in a boat 
 drown soul and sense , while wistfully they strain 
 weak eyes upon the glistering sands that robe 
 the understream . the wise could he behold 
 cathedralled caverns of thick ribb è d gold 
 and branching silvers of the central globe 
 would marvel from so beautiful a sight 
 how scorn and ruin , pain and hate could flow 
 but hatred in a gold cave sits below 
 pleached with her hair , in mail of argent light 
 shot into gold , a snake her forehead clips 
 and skins the colour from her trembling lips

 doth hurt his fruit , or him can move 
 hee shuns all strifes , and never doth resort 
 the sinfull gates o ’ th ’ greedy court

ah , woe is me for pleasure that is vain 
 ah , woe is me for glory that is past 
 pleasure that bringeth sorrow at the last 
 glory that at the last bringeth no gain

 it shall say till the mighty angel blast 
 is blown , making the sun and moon aghast 
 and showering down the stars like sudden rain 
 and evermore men shall go fearfully 
 bending beneath their weight of heaviness 
 and ancient men shall lie down wearily 
 and strong men shall rise up in weariness 
 yea , even the young shall answer sighingly 
 saying one to another : how vain it is 

i love thee when thy swelling buds appear 
 and one by one their tender leaves unfold 
 as if they knew that warmer suns were near 
 nor longer sought to hide from winter 's cold 
 and when with darker growth thy leaves are seen 
 to veil from view the early robin 's nest 
 i love to lie beneath thy waving screen 
 with limbs by summer 's heat and toil oppressed 
 and when the autumn winds have stripped thee bare 
 and round thee lies the smooth , untrodden snow 
 when naught is thine that made thee once so fair 
 i love to watch thy shadowy form below 
 and through thy leafless arms to look above 
 on stars that brighter beam when most we need their love

 and all the strife of sect and creed and rite 
 santon and gouroo waging holy fight 
 for the wise monarch , claiming not to be

 and beauty making beautiful old rhyme 
 in praise of ladies dead , and lovely knights 
 then in the blazon of sweet beauty 's best 
 of hand , of foot , of lip , of eye , of brow 
 i see their antique pen would have expressed 
 even such a beauty as you master now 
 so all their praises are but prophecies 
 of this our time , all you prefiguring

 they had not skill enough your worth to sing

 not from thy nobler port , for there are none 
 more quiet featured : some there are who bear 
 their message on their brows , while others wear 
 a look of large commission , nor will shun 
 the fiery trial , so their work is done 
 but thou hast parted with thine eyes in prayer 
 unearthly are they both ; and so thy lips 
 seem like the porches of the spirit land 
 for thou hast laid a mighty treasure by 
 unlocked by him in nature , and thine eye 
 burns with a vision and apocalypse 
 thy own sweet soul can hardly understand 

with shame repulsed , with grief and fury driven

 but like when wasps from hollow crannies drive 
 to guard the entrance of their common hive 
 darkening the rock , while with unwearied wings 
 they strike the assailants , and infix their stings

 so fierce these greeks their last retreats defend

 if aught that giver from my mind efface 
 if i that giver 's bounty e'er disgrace 
 then roll to me along your wand'rig spheres 
 only to number out a villain 's years 
 i lay my hand upon my swelling breast 
 and grateful would , but cannot speak the rest 

a life so sacred , such serene repose 
 seem 'd heaven itself , till one suggestion rose 
 that vice should triumph , virtue vice obey 
 this sprung some doubt of providence 's sway 
 his hopes no more a certain prospect boast 
 and all the tenor of his soul is lost 
 so when a smooth expanse receives impress 'd 
 calm nature 's image on its watery breast 
 down bend the banks , the trees depending grow 
 and skies beneath with answering colours glow 
 but if a stone the gentle scene divide 
 swift ruffling circles curl on every side 
 and glimmering fragments of a broken sun 
 banks , trees , and skies , in thick disorder run 

see , now me thinkes , the cloudes in throngs 
 the lightning leaps too , at my ravishing songs 
 iris about my neck hangs round 
 and with her divers colour ’ d bow , i ’ me bound 
 being now my selfe , and newly wak ’ d 
 my not unwelcome dreames , just now off shak ’ d 
 thrice o ’ re my lute , i scarce had run 
 with nible finger neat division 
 remembring horace , thee , my guide 
 when my high genius through th ’ ayre doth ride 
 now o ’ re the scatt ’ red islands , then 
 o ’ re seas , with dry feet passing back again 
 nothing that ’ s mortall of mee , now 
 i beare , and nought to my dull bulke i owe 

my love is as a fever longing still 
 for that which longer nurseth the disease 
 feeding on that which doth preserve the ill 
 th ’ uncertain sickly appetite to please 
 my reason the physician to my love 
 angry that his prescriptions are not kept 
 hath left me , and i desperate now approve 
 desire is death , which physic did except 
 past cure i am , now reason is past care 
 and frantic mad with evermore unrest 
 my thoughts and my discourse as mad men 's are 
 at random from the truth vainly expressed 
 for i have sworn thee fair , and thought thee bright 
 who art as black as hell , as dark as night 

which are the clouds , and which the mountains ? see 
 they mix and melt together ! yon blue hill 
 looks fleeting as the vapors which distill 
 their dews upon its summit , while the free 
 and far off clouds , now solid , dark , and still 
 an aspect wear of calm eternity 
 each seems the other , as our fancies will 
 the cloud a mount , the mount a cloud , and we 
 gaze doubtfully . so everywhere on earth 
 this foothold where we stand with slipping feet 
 the unsubstantial and substantial meet 
 and we are fooled until made wise by time 
 is not the obvious lesson something worth 
 lady ? or have i wov'n an idle rhyme 

i purposed once to take my pen and write 
 not songs , like some , tormented and awry 
 with passion , but a cunning harmony 
 of words and music caught from glen and height 
 and lucid colours born of woodland light 
 and shining places where the sea streams lie 
 but this was when the heat of youth glowed white 
 and since i 've put the faded purpose by 
 i have no faultless fruits to offer you 
 who read this book ; but certain syllables 
 herein are borrowed from unfooted dells 
 and secret hollows dear to noontide dew 
 and these at least , though far between and few 
 may catch the sense like subtle forest spells 

bride of the shark , her valour first i sing 
 who on the lone seas quickened of a king 
 she , from the shore and puny homes of men 
 beyond the climber 's sea discerning ken 
 swam , led by omens ; and devoid of fear 
 beheld her monstrous paramour draw near 
 she gazed ; all round her to the heavenly pale 
 the simple sea was void of isle or sail 
 sole overhead the unsparing sun was reared 
 when the deep bubbled and the brute appeared 
 but she , secure in the decrees of fate 
 made strong her bosom and received the mate 
 and , men declare , from that marine embrace 
 conceived the virtues of a stronger race 

the learned teacher satisfaction showed 
 that such success from his instructions flowed 
 laughed heartily at husbands , silly wights 
 who had not wit to guard connubial rights 
 and from their lamb the wily wolf to keep 
 a shepherd will o'erlook a hundred sheep 
 while foolish man 's unable to protect 
 e'en one where most he 'd wish to be correct 
 howe'er , this care he thought was somewhat hard 
 but not a thing impossible to guard 
 and if he had not got a hundred eyes 
 thank heav'n , his wife , though cunning to devise 
 he could defy :— her thoughts so well he knew 
 that these intrigues she never would pursue 

if glorious visions , born for all mankind 
 the bright auroras of our twilight mind 
 if fancies , varying as the shapes that lie 
 stained on the windows of the sunset sky 
 if hopes , that beckon with delusive gleams 
 till the eye dances in the void of dreams 
 if passions , following with the winds that urge 
 earth 's wildest wanderer to her farthest verge 
 if these on all some transient hours bestow 
 of rapture tingling with its hectic glow 
 then all are poets ; and if earth had rolled 
 her myriad centuries , and her doom were told 
 each moaning billow of her shoreless wave 
 would wail its requiem o'er a poet 's grave 

hear from me , long armed lord ! the makings five 
 which go to every act , in sankhya taught 
 as necessary . first the force ; and then 
 the agent ; next , the various instruments 
 fourth , the especial effort ; fifth , the god 
 what work soever any mortal doth 
 of body , mind , or speech , evil or good 
 by these five doth he that . which being thus 
 whoso , for lack of knowledge , seeth himself 
 as the sole actor , knoweth nought at all 
 and seeth nought . therefore , i say , if one 
 holding aloof from self — with unstained mind 
 should slay all yonder host , being bid to slay 
 he doth not slay ; he is not bound thereby 

delia , these eyes that so admireth thine 
 have seen those walls which proud ambition reared 
 to check the world , how they entombed have lain 
 within themselves , and on them ploughs have eared 
 yet never found that barbarous hand attained 
 the spoil of fame deserved by virtuous men 
 whose glorious actions luckily had gained 
 th'eternal annals of a happy pen 
 and therefore grieve not if thy beauties die 
 though time do spoil thee of the fairest veil 
 that ever yet covered mortality 
 and must instar the needle and the rail 
 that grace which doth more than inwoman thee 
 lives in my lines and must eternal be 

methinks i hear the thoughtful reader ask 
 “ why was the man , at once , not ta'en to task 
 why did the other men not take a part 
 with that poor boy , and show a feeling heart 
 i am informed they all enjoyed the joke 
 not one reproachful word they ever spoke 
 i blush to think that any of my trade 
 should of such monsters ever be afraid 
 the very thought still makes my blood to boil 
 and shuddering , from such thoughts i back recoil 
 i would have dragged the fiend unto a jail 
 or had him fastened to a wagon 's tail 
 laid bare his back , and let the lash descend 
 and , doing this , would still my act defend 

above this field that shines an eden , lo 
 that wondrous arch of many married hues 
 a gorgeous belt , round nature 's lovely waist 
 sure , earth now seems no place of graves . a wide 
 gay , blooming paradise ! with moistened face 
 she smiles , like god , upon this joyous world 
 a new , wild burst of various harmony 
 salutes that bow of charm — that orb of glory 
 thou art the sun and rainbow to my heart 
 and , as they fade from sight — but do not die 
 but come to morrow with their wonted charms 
 thou shalt not die — but gleam o'er me in heaven 
 with none of all thy beauty , lost or less 
 can'st thou not sing a song , love , ere it fades 

yes ! let the rich deride , the proud disdain 
 these simple blessings of the lowly train 
 to me more dear , congenial to my heart 
 one native charm , than all the gloss of art 
 spontaneous joys , where nature has its play 
 the soul adopts , and owns their firstborn sway 
 lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind 
 unenvied , unmolested , unconfined 
 but the long pomp , the midnight masquerade 
 with all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed 
 in these , ere triflers half their wish obtain 
 the toiling pleasure sickens into pain 
 and , e'en while fashion 's brightest arts decoy 
 the heart distrusting asks if this be joy 

the silver trumpets rang across the dome 
 the people knelt upon the ground with awe 
 and borne upon the necks of men i saw 
 like some great god , the holy lord of rome 
 priest like , he wore a robe more white than foam 
 and , king like , swathed himself in royal red 
 three crowns of gold rose high upon his head 
 in splendour and in light the pope passed home 
 my heart stole back across wide wastes of years 
 to one who wandered by a lonely sea 
 and sought in vain for any place of rest 
 ‘ foxes have holes , and every bird its nest 
 i , only i , must wander wearily 
 and bruise my feet , and drink wine salt with tears 

when my abodes prefixed time is spent 
 my cruell fayre streight bids me wend my way 
 but then from heaven most hideous stormes are sent 
 as willing me against her will to stay 
 whom then shall i — or heaven , or her — obay 
 the heavens know best what is the best for me 
 but as she will , whose will my life doth sway 
 my lower heaven , so it perforce must be 
 but ye high hevens , that all this sorowe see 
 sith all your tempests cannot hold me backe 
 aswage your storms , or else both you and she 
 will both together me too sorely wrack 
 enough it is for one man to sustaine 
 the stormes which she alone on me doth raine 

well , when in summer afternoons you see 
 men fain to listen , tell them about me 
 tell them that , born a freedman 's son , possessed 
 of slender means , i soared beyond my nest 
 that so whate'er ' s deducted for my birth 
 may count as assets on the score of worth 
 say that i pleased the greatest of my day 
 then draw my picture ;— prematurely grey 
 of little person , fond of sunny ease 
 lightly provoked , but easy to appease 
 last , if my age they ask you , let them know 
 that i was forty four not long ago 
 in the december of last year , the same 
 that goes by lepidus ’ and lollius ’ name 

a path , old tree , goes by thee crooking on 
 and through this little gate that claps and bangs 
 against thy rifted trunk , what steps hath gone 
 though but a lonely way , yet mystery hangs 
 oer crowds of pastoral scenes recordless here 
 the boy might climb the nest in thy young boughs 
 that 's slept half an eternity ; in fear 
 the herdsman may have left his startled cows 
 for shelter when heaven 's thunder voice was near 
 here too the woodman on his wallet laid 
 for pillow may have slept an hour away 
 and poet pastoral , lover of the shade 
 here sat and mused half some long summer day 
 while some old shepherd listened to the lay 

what does the dim gaze of the dying find 
 to waken dream or memory , seeing you 
 in your sweet eyes what other eyes are blue 
 and in your hair what gold hair on the wind 
 floats of the days gone almost out of mind 
 in deep green valleys of the fatherland 
 he may remember girls with locks like thine 
 may dream how , where the waiting angels stand 
 some lost love 's eyes are dim before they shine 
 with welcome : — so past homes , or homes to be 
 he sees a moment , ere , a moment blind 
 he crosses death 's inhospitable sea 
 and with brief passage of those barren lands 
 comes to the home that is not made with hands 

look you , it is to day as at the first 
 when adam first was ‘ ware his new made eyes 
 and opened them , behold the light ! and breath 
 of god was misting yet about his mouth 
 whereof they had made his soul . then he looked forth 
 and was a part of light ; also he saw 
 beautiful life , and it could move . but eve — eve 
 was the child of midnight and of sleep 
 lo , in the dark god led her to his side 
 it may be in the dark she heard him breathe 
 before god woke him . and she knew not light 
 nor life but as a voice that left his lips 
 a warmth that clasped her ; but the stars were out 
 and she with wide child eyes gazed up at them 

i have done i know not what ,— what have i done 
 my brother 's blood , my brother 's soul , doth cry 
 and i find no defence , find no reply 
 no courage more to run this race i run 
 not knowing what i have done , have left undone 
 ah me , these awful unknown hours that fly 
 fruitless it may be , fleeting fruitless by 
 rank with death savor underneath the sun 
 for what avails it that i did not know 
 the deed i did ? what profits me the plea 
 that had i known i had not wronged him so 
 lord jesus christ , my god , him pity thou 
 lord , if it may be , pity also me 
 in judgment pity , and in death , and now 

if heav'n a date of many years wou 'd give 
 thus i 'd in pleasure , ease and plenty live 
 and as i near approach 'd the verge of life 
 some kind relation ( for i 'd have no wife 
 should take upon him all my worldly care 
 while i did for a better state prepare 
 then i 'd not be with any trouble vext 
 nor have the evening of my days perplext 
 but by a silent , and a peaceful death 
 without a sigh , resign my aged breath 
 and when committed to the dust , i 'd have 
 few tears , but friendly drop 'd into my grave 
 then wou 'd my exit so propitious be 
 all men wou 'd wish to live and dye like me 

waked by the cries , the athenian chief arose 
 the knightly forms of combat to dispose 
 and passing through the obsequious guards , he sate 
 conspicuous on a throne , sublime in state 
 there , for the two contending knights he sent 
 arm 'd cap a pie , with reverence low they bent 
 he smiled on both , and with superior look 
 alike their offer 'd adoration took 
 the people press on every side to see 
 their awful prince , and hear his high decree 
 then signing to their heralds with his hand 
 they gave his orders from their lofty stand 
 silence is thrice enjoin 'd ; then thus aloud 
 the king at arms bespeaks the knights and listening crowd 

vast hollow voids , beyond the utmost reach 
 of suns , their legions withering at his nod 
 died into day hearing the voice of god 
 and seas new made , immense and furious , each 
 plunged and rolled forward , feeling for a beach 
 he walked the waters with effulgence shod 
 this being made , he yearned for worlds to make 
 from other chaos out beyond our night 
 for to create is still god 's prime delight 
 the large moon , all alone , sailed her dark lake 
 and the first tides were moving to her might 
 then darkness trembled , and began to quake 
 big with the birth of stars , and when he spake 
 a million worlds leapt into radiant light 

projectiles , music , and the sculptor 's art 
 his chestnut whistle and his shingle dart 
 his elder pop gun with its hickory rod 
 its sharp explosion and rebounding wad 
 his corn stalk fiddle , and the deeper tone 
 that murmurs from his pumpkin stalk trombone 
 conspire to teach the boy . to these succeed 
 his bow , his arrow of a feathered reed 
 his windmill , raised the passing breeze to win 
 his water wheel , that turns upon a pin 
 or , if his father lives upon the shore 
 you 'll see his ship , “ beam ends upon the floor 
 full rigged , with raking masts , and timbers stanch 
 and waiting , near the wash tub , for a launch 

i writ how once i wander 'd from thy side 
 serving the strong suggestions of my blood 
 only to prove from worse things vainly tried 
 how far more precious grew thy sum of good 
 if i so lov 'd thee , what is my defence 
 that thy dear love fail 'd then my steps to stay 
 that idle hours were idly given to sense 
 and soul forsaken at the call of clay 
 o let love grant excuse ; my sensual part 
 dwelt ever far from pure untainted thee 
 it held no conversation with my heart 
 nor , us 'd or check 'd , could be thine injury 
 if once it triumph 'd , carrying me away 
 it stole but earth ; my soul did with thee stay 

in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes 
 for they in thee a thousand errors note 
 but ‘ tis my heart that loves what they despise 
 who in despite of view is pleased to dote 
 nor are mine cars with thy tongue 's tune delighted 
 nor tender feeling to base touches prone 
 nor taste , nor smell , desire to be invited 
 to any sensual feast with thee alone 
 but my five wits , nor my five senses can 
 dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee 
 who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man 
 thy proud heart 's slave and vassal wretch to be 
 only my plague thus far i count my gain 
 that she that makes me sin , awards me pain 

maiden , when such a soul as thine is born 
 the morning stars their ancient music make 
 and , joyful , once again their song awake 
 long silent now with melancholy scorn 
 and thou , not mindless of so blest a morn 
 by no least deed its harmony shalt break 
 but shalt to that high chime thy footsteps take 
 through life 's most darksome passes unforlorn 
 therefore from thy pure faith thou shalt not fall 
 therefore shalt thou be ever fair and free 
 and in thine every motion musical 
 as summer air , majestic as the sea 
 a mystery to those who creep and crawl 
 through time , and part it from eternity 

he walked with god , by faith , in solitude 
 at early dawn or tranquil eventide 
 in some lone leafy place he would abide 
 till his whole being was with god imbued 
 he walked with god amid the multitude 
 no threats or smiles could his firm soul divide 
 from that beloved presence at his side 
 whose still small voice silenced earth 's noises rude 
 boldly abroad to men he testified 
 how “ the lord cometh ” and the judgment brings 
 gently at home he trained his “ sons and daughters 
 till , praying , a bright chariot he espied 
 sent to translate him , as on angels ’ wings 
 to walk with god beside heaven 's “ living waters 

dear ladies , though last to receive my oblation 
 and last in the list of mosaic creation 
 the last is the best , and the last shall be first 
 through eve , sayeth moses , old adam was cursed 
 but i cannot agree with you , moses , that adam 
 sinned and fell through the gentle persuasion of madam 
 the victim , no doubt , of egyptian flirtation 
 you mistook your chagrin for divine inspiration 
 and condemned all the sex without proof or probation 
 as we rhymsters mistake the moonbeams that elate us 
 for flashes of wit or the holy afflatus 
 and imagine we hear the applause of a nation 
 but all honest men who are married and blest 
 will agree that the last work of god is the best 

time flies , hope flags , life plies a wearied wing 
 death following hard on life gains ground apace 
 faith runs with each and rears an eager face 
 outruns the rest , makes light of everything 
 spurns earth , and still finds breath to pray and sing 
 while love ahead of all uplifts his praise 
 still asks for grace and still gives thanks for grace 
 content with all day brings and night will bring 
 life wanes ; and when love folds his wings above 
 tired hope , and less we feel his conscious pulse 
 let us go fall asleep , dear friend , in peace 
 a little while , and age and sorrow cease 
 a little while , and life reborn annuls 
 loss and decay and death , and all is love 

could i but picture her — ah , you would deem 
 my tale the figment of a poet 's dream 
 and if you saw her , ( could such bliss be given 
 you'ld think yourself in dreamland — or in heaven 
 not the red rapture of new wakened roses 
 when morning dew their soul of love uncloses 
 ( roses that must be wooed ,— nor may be won 
 save by the prince of lovers , the warm sun 
 not the fair lily , nor the violet shy 
 whose heart 's love lurks deep in her still blue eye 
 nor any flower , the loveliest and the best 
 can image to you half the charm compressed 
 in those dear eyes , those lips ,— nay , every part 
 that made that sum of witcheries — elfinhart 

aisles and abysses ; leagues no man explores 
 of rock that labyrinths and night that drips 
 where everlasting silence broods , with lips 
 of adamant , o'er earthquakehyppphenbuilded floors 
 where forms , such as the demon world adores 
 laborious water carves ; whence echo ships 
 wild tongued o'er pools where petrifaction strips 
 her breasts of crystal from which crystal pours 
 here where primordial fear , the gorgon , sits 
 staring all life to stone in ghastly mirth 
 i seem to tread , with awe no tongue can tell 
 beneath vast domes , by torrent tortured pits 
 ‘ mid wrecks terrific of the ruined earth 
 an ancient causeway of forgotten hell 

dunbar , no poet wears your laurels now 
 none rises , singing , from your race like you 
 dark melodist , immortal , though the dew 
 fell early on the bays upon your brow 
 and tinged with pathos every halcyon vow 
 and brave endeavor . silence o'er you threw 
 flowerets of love . or , if an envious few 
 of your own people brought no garlands , how 
 could malice smite him whom the gods had crowned 
 if , like the meadow lark , your flight was low 
 your flooded lyrics half the hilltops drowned 
 a wide world heard you , and it loved you so 
 it stilled its heart to list the strains you sang 
 and o'er your happy songs its plaudits rang 

if i had chosen thee , thou shouldst have been 
 a virgin proud , untamed , immaculate 
 chaste as the morning star , a saint , a queen 
 scarred by no wars , no violence of hate 
 thou shouldst have been of soul commensurate 
 with thy fair body , brave and virtuous 
 and kind and just ; and if of poor estate 
 at least an honest woman for my house 
 i would have had thee come of honored blood 
 and honorable nurture . thou shouldst bear 
 sons to my pride and daughters to my heart 
 and men should hold thee happy , wise , and good 
 lo , thou art none of this , but only fair 
 yet must i love thee , dear , and as thou art 

i feel the well known breeze , and the sweet hill 
 again appears , where rose that beauteous light 
 which , while heaven willed it , met my eyes , then bright 
 with gladness , but now dimmed with many an ill 
 vain hopes ! weak thoughts ! now , turbid is the rill 
 the flowers have drooped ; and she hath ta'en her flight 
 from the cold nest , which once , in proud delight 
 living and dying , i had hoped to fill 
 i hoped , in these retreats , and in the blaze 
 of her fair eyes , which have consumed my heart 
 to taste the sweet reward of troubled days 
 thou , whom i serve , how hard and proud thou art 
 erewhile , thy flame consumed me ; now , i mourn 
 over the ashes which have ceased to burn 

penelope , for her ulisses sake 
 deviz 'd a web her wooers to deceave 
 in which the worke that she all day did make 
 the same at night she did againe unreave 
 such subtile craft my damzell doth conceave 
 th'importune suit of my desire to shonne 
 for all that i in many dayes do weave 
 in one short houre i find by her undonne 
 so when i thinke to end that i begonne 
 i must begin and never bring to end 
 for with one looke she spils that long i sponne 
 and with one word my whole years work doth rend 
 such labour like the spyders web i fynd 
 whose fruitlesse worke is broken with least wynd 

when i had chosen on the river 's edge 
 such station , that the distance of the stream 
 alone did separate me ; there i stay 'd 
 my steps for clearer prospect , and beheld 
 the flames go onward , leaving , as they went 
 the air behind them painted as with trail 
 of liveliest pencils ! so distinct were mark 'd 
 all those sev'n listed colours , whence the sun 
 maketh his bow , and cynthia her zone 
 these streaming gonfalons did flow beyond 
 my vision ; and ten paces , as i guess 
 parted the outermost . beneath a sky 
 so beautiful , came foul and twenty elders 
 by two and two , with flower de luces crown 'd 

she hastens out and scarcely pins her clothes 
 to hear the news and tell the news she knows 
 she talks of sluts , marks each unmended gown 
 her self the dirtiest slut in all the town 
 she stands with eager haste at slander 's tale 
 and drinks the news as drunkards drink their ale 
 excuse is ready at the biggest lie 
 she only heard it and it passes bye 
 the very cat looks up and knows her face 
 and hastens to the chair to get the place 
 when once set down she never goes away 
 till tales are done and talk has nought to say 
 she goes from house to house the village oer 
 her slander bothers everybody 's door 

v. and love had not been prisoned in cold stone 
 nor beauty smeared on the dead canvas so 
 had not their worshipper been forced to go 
 questful and restless through the world alone 
 searching but finding not , till on him shone 
 back from his own deep heart a chilly glow 
 as of a frost nipped sunbeam , or of snow 
 under a storm dodged crescent which hath grown 
 wasted to mockery ; and beneath such gleam 
 his wan conceits have found an utterance 
 which , had they found a true and sunny beam 
 had ripened into real touch and glance 
 nay more , to real deed , the truth of all 
 to some perfection high and personal 

come walk with me along this willowed lane 
 where , like lost coinage from some miser 's store 
 the golden dandelions more and more 
 glow , as the warm sun kisses them again 
 for this is may ! who with a daisy chain 
 leads on the laughing hours ; for now is o'er 
 long winter 's trance . no longer rise and roar 
 his forest wrenching blasts . the hopeful swain 
 along the furrow , sings behind his team 
 loud pipes the redbreast — troubadour of spring 
 and vocal all the morning copses ring 
 more blue the skies in lucent lakelets gleam 
 and the glad earth , caressed by murmuring showers 
 wakes like a bride , to deck herself with flowers 

swift , at the word , the herald speeds along 
 the lofty ramparts , through the martial throng 
 and finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore 
 opposed in combat on the dusty shore 
 “ ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands 
 your aid ( said thoos ) peteus ’ son demands 
 your strength , united , best may help to bear 
 the bloody labours of the doubtful war 
 thither the lycian princes bend their course 
 the best and bravest of the hostile force 
 but if too fiercely , here , the foes contend 
 at least , let telamon those towers defend 
 and teucer haste with his unerring bow 
 to share the danger , and repel the foe 

at length a wedding much attention caught 
 the lads and lasses of the hamlet sought 
 to see the couple pass : the belle perceived 
 the very man for whom her bosom heaved 
 and loudly cried , behold scamander 's flood 
 which raised surprise ; soon numbers round her stood 
 astonishment expressed , but still the fair 
 whate'er was asked , would nothing more declare 
 than , in the spacious , blue , ethereal sky 
 her marriage would be soon , they might rely 
 a laugh prevailed ; for what was to be done 
 the god with hasty steps away had run 
 and none with stones pursued his rapid flight 
 the deity was quickly ought of sight 

o humble me ! i cannot bide the joy 
 that in my saviour 's presence ever flows 
 may i be lowly , lest it may destroy 
 the peace his childlike spirit ever knows 
 i would not speak thy word , but by thee stand 
 while thou dost to thine erring children speak 
 o help me but to keep his own command 
 and in my strength to feel me ever weak 
 then in thy presence shall i humbly stay 
 nor lose the life of love he came to give 
 and find at last the life , the truth , the way 
 to where with him thy blessed servants live 
 and walk forever in the path of truth 
 a servant , yet a son ; a sire and yet a youth 

thus is the panther neither loved nor fear 'd 
 a mere mock queen of a divided herd 
 whom soon by lawful power she might control 
 herself a part submitted to the whole 
 then , as the moon who first receives the light 
 by which she makes our nether regions bright 
 so might she shine , reflecting from afar 
 the rays she borrow 'd from a better star 
 big with the beams which from her mother flow 
 and reigning o'er the rising tides below 
 now , mixing with a savage crowd , she goes 
 and meanly flatters her inveterate foes 
 ruled while she rules , and losing every hour 
 her wretched remnants of precarious power 

within a thick and spreading hawthorn bush 
 that overhung a mole hill large and round 
 i heard from morn to morn a merry thrush 
 sing hymns of rapture , while i drank the sound 
 with joy ; and oft , an unintruding guest 
 i watch 'd her secret toils from day to day 
 how true she warp 'd the moss to form her nest 
 and modell 'd it within with wool and clay 
 and bye and bye , like heath bells gilt with dew 
 there lay her shining eggs as bright as flowers 
 ink spotted over , shells of green and blue 
 and there i witness 'd , in the summer hours 
 a brood of nature 's minstrels chirp and fly 
 glad as the sunshine and the laughing sky 

and thou , my village ! as again i tread 
 amidst thy living and above thy dead 
 though some fair playmates guard with charter fears 
 their cheeks , grown holy with the lapse of years 
 though with the dust some reverend locks may blend 
 where life 's last mile stone marks the journey 's end 
 on every bud the changing year recalls 
 the brightening glance of morning memory falls 
 still following onward as the months unclose 
 the balmy lilac or the bridal rose 
 and still shall follow , till they sink once more 
 beneath the snow drifts of the frozen shore 
 as when my bark , long tossing in the gale 
 furled in her port her tempest rended sail 

still mid the corpses and the blood fought on 
 those glorious sons of gods , nor ever ceased 
 from wrath of fight . but eris now inclined 
 the fatal scales of battle , which no more 
 were equal poised . beneath the breast bone then 
 of godlike memnon plunged achilles ’ sword 
 clear through his body all the dark blue blade 
 leapt : suddenly snapped the silver cord of life 
 down in a pool of blood he fell , and clashed 
 his massy armour , and earth rang again 
 then turned to flight his comrades panic struck 
 and of his arms the myrmidons stripped the dead 
 while fled the trojans , and achilles chased 
 as whirlwind swift and mighty to destroy 

sometimes an action on the stage is shown 
 sometimes ‘ tis done elsewhere , and there made known 
 a thing when heard , remember , strikes less keen 
 on the spectator 's mind than when ‘ tis seen 
 yet ‘ twere not well in public to display 
 a business best transacted far away 
 and much may be secluded from the eye 
 for well graced tongues to tell of by and by 
 medea must not shed her children 's blood 
 nor savage atreus cook man 's flesh for food 
 nor philomel turn bird or cadmus snake 
 with people looking on and wide awake 
 if scenes like these before my eyes be thrust 
 they shock belief and generate disgust 

i know the sorrows of the last abyss 
 i walked the cold black pools without a star 
 i lay on rock of unseen flint and spar 
 i heard the execrable serpent hiss 
 i dreamed of sun , fruit tree , and virgin 's kiss 
 i woke alone with midnight near and far 
 and everlasting hunger , keen to mar 
 but i arose , and my reward is this 
 i am no more one more amid the throng 
 though name be naught , and lips forever weak 
 i seem to know at last of mighty song 
 and with no blush , no tremor on the cheek 
 i do claim consort with the great and strong 
 who suffered ill and had the gift to speak 

now that we 've done our best and worst , and parted 
 i would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend 
 ( o heart , i do not dare go empty hearted 
 i 'll think of love in books , love without end 
 women with child , content ; and old men sleeping 
 and wet strong ploughlands , scarred for certain grain 
 and babes that weep , and so forget their weeping 
 and the young heavens , forgetful after rain 
 and evening hush , broken by homing wings 
 and song 's nobility and wisdom holy 
 that live , we dead . i would think of a thousand things 
 lovely and durable , and taste them slowly 
 one after one , like tasting a sweet food 
 i have need to busy my heart with quietude 

th ’ escorting spirits turn 'd with gentle looks 
 toward me , and the mantuan spake : “ my son 
 here torment thou mayst feel , but canst not death 
 remember thee , remember thee , if i 
 safe e'en on geryon brought thee : now i come 
 more near to god , wilt thou not trust me now 
 of this be sure : though in its womb that flame 
 a thousand years contain 'd thee , from thy head 
 no hair should perish . if thou doubt my truth 
 approach , and with thy hands thy vesture 's hem 
 stretch forth , and for thyself confirm belief 
 lay now all fear , o lay all fear aside 
 turn hither , and come onward undismay 'd 
 i still , though conscience urg 'd ’ no step advanc 'd 

some foreign writers , some our own despise 
 the ancients only , or the moderns prize 
 thus wit , like faith , by each man is applied 
 to one small sect , and all are damned beside 
 meanly they seek the blessing to confine 
 and force that sun but on a part to shine 
 which not alone the southern wit sublimes 
 but ripens spirits in cold northern climes 
 which from the first has shone on ages past 
 enlights the present , and shall warm the last 
 though each may feel increases and decays 
 and see now clearer and now darker days 
 regard not then if wit be old or new 
 but blame the false , and value still the true 

if matter changed and turned to fire acquires 
 the movement of a lighter element 
 rising aloft unto the highest heaven 
 wherefore , ignited by the fire of love 
 swifter than wind , dost thou not rise and flash 
 into the sun and be incorporate there 
 why rather stay a pilgrim here below 
 than open through the air and us a way 
 no spark of fire from that heart 
 goes out through the wide atmosphere 
 body of dust and ashes is not seen 
 nor water laden smoke ascends on high 
 all is contained entire within itself 
 and not of flame , is reason , sense , or thought 

a lofty type of all her sex , i ween 
 my english brothers , though your wayward race 
 now slight the soul that never wore a screen 
 and loved too well to keep her noble place 
 ah , bravest woman that our world hath seen 
 ( a light in spaces wild and tempest tost 
 in every verse of thine , behold , we trace 
 the full reflection of an earnest face 
 and hear the scrawling of an eager pen 
 o sisters ! knowing what you 've loved and lost 
 i ask where shall we find its like , and when 
 that dear heart with its passion sorrow crost 
 and pathos rippling , like a brook in june 
 amongst the roses of a windless noon 

i saw a wolfe under a rockie cave 
 noursing two whelpes ; i saw her litle ones 
 in wanton dalliance the teate to crave 
 while she her neck wreath 'd from them for the nones 
 i saw her raunge abroad to seeke her food 
 and roming through the field with greedie rage 
 t'embrew her teeth and clawes with lukewarm blood 
 of the small heards , her thirst for to asswage 
 i saw a thousand huntsmen , which descended 
 downe from the mountaines bordring lombardie 
 that with an hundred speares her flank wide rened 
 i saw her on the plaine outstretched lie 
 throwing out thousand throbs in her owne soyle 
 soone on a tree uphang 'd i saw her spoyle 

here is the place where loveliness keeps house 
 between the river and the wooded hills 
 within a valley where the springtime spills 
 her firstling wind flowers under blossoming boughs 
 where summer sits braiding her warm , white brows 
 with bramble roses ; and where autumn fills 
 her lap with asters ; and old winter frills 
 with crimson haw and hip his snowy blouse 
 here you may meet with beauty . here she sits 
 gazing upon the moon , or all the day 
 tuning a wood thrush flute , remote , unseen 
 or when the storm is out , ‘ tis she who flits 
 from rock to rock , a form of flying spray 
 shouting , beneath the leaves ’ tumultuous green 

thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear 
 thy dial how thy precious minutes waste 
 these vacant leaves thy mind 's imprint will bear 
 and of this book , this learning mayst thou taste 
 the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show 
 of mouthed graves will give thee memory 
 thou by thy dial 's shady stealth mayst know 
 time 's thievish progress to eternity 
 look what thy memory cannot contain 
 commit to these waste blanks , and thou shalt find 
 those children nursed , delivered from thy brain 
 to take a new acquaintance of thy mind 
 these offices , so oft as thou wilt look 
 shall profit thee , and much enrich thy book 

yet all its varied charms , forever free 
 from task and tribute , labor yields to thee 
 no more , when april sheds her fitful rain 
 the sower 's hand shall cast its flying grain 
 no more , when autumn strews the flaming leaves 
 the reaper 's band shall gird its yellow sheaves 
 for thee alike the circling seasons flow 
 till the first blossoms heave the latest snow 
 in the stiff clod below the whirling drifts 
 in the loose soil the springing herbage lifts 
 in the hot dust beneath the parching weeds 
 life 's withering flower shall drop its shrivelled seeds 
 its germ entranced in thy unbreathing sleep 
 till what thou sowest mightier angels reap 

but while geraint lay healing of his hurt 
 the blameless king went forth and cast his eyes 
 on each of all whom uther left in charge 
 long since , to guard the justice of the king 
 he looked and found them wanting ; and as now 
 men weed the white horse on the berkshire hills 
 to keep him bright and clean as heretofore 
 he rooted out the slothful officer 
 or guilty , which for bribe had winked at wrong 
 and in their chairs set up a stronger race 
 with hearts and hands , and sent a thousand men 
 to till the wastes , and moving everywhere 
 cleared the dark places and let in the law 
 and broke the bandit holds and cleansed the land 

point to the summits where the brave have bled 
 where every village claims its glorious dead 
 say , when their bosoms met the bayonet 's shock 
 their only corselet was the rustic frock 
 say , when they mustered to the gathering horn 
 the titled chieftain curled his lip in scorn 
 yet , when their leader bade his lines advance 
 no musket wavered in the lion 's glance 
 say , when they fainted in the forced retreat 
 they tracked the snow drifts with their bleeding feet 
 yet still their banners , tossing in the blast 
 bore ever ready , faithful to the last 
 through storm and battle , till they waved again 
 on yorktown 's hills and saratoga 's plain 

for sunday 's play he never makes excuse 
 but plays at taw , and buys his spanish juice 
 hard as his toil , and ever slow to speak 
 yet he gives maidens many a burning cheek 
 for none can pass him but his witless grace 
 of bawdry brings the blushes in her face 
 as vulgar as the dirt he treads upon 
 he calls his cows or drives his horses on 
 he knows the lamest cow and strokes her side 
 and often tries to mount her back and ride 
 and takes her tail at night in idle play 
 and makes her drag him homeward all the way 
 he knows of nothing but the football match 
 and where hens lay , and when the duck will hatch 

thou hast made me , and shall thy work decay 
 repair me now , for now mine end doth haste 
 i run to death , and death meets me as fast 
 and all my pleasures are like yesterday 
 i dare not move my dim eyes any way 
 despair behind , and death before doth cast 
 such terror ; and my feeble flesh doth waste 
 by sin in it , which it towards hell doth weigh 
 only them art above , and when towards thee 
 by thy leave i can look , i rise again 
 but our old subtle foe so tempteth me 
 that not one hour myself i can sustain 
 thy grace may wing me to prevent his art 
 and thou like adamant draw mine iron heart 

were't not for you , here should my pen have rest 
 and take a long leave of sweet poesy 
 britannia 's swains , and rivers far by west 
 should hear no more mine oaten melody 
 yet shall the song i sung of them awhile 
 unperfect lie , and make no further known 
 the happy loves of this our pleasant isle 
 till i have left some record of mine own 
 you are the subject now , and , writing you 
 i well may versify , not poetize 
 here needs no fiction : for the graces true 
 and virtues clip not with base flatteries 
 here could i write what you deserve of praise 
 others might wear , but i should win the bays 

but he lay in peace , with his solemn eye 
 looking far through the mists of futurity 
 a smile gleamed over the death dew that lay 
 on his withered cheek as life ebbed away 
 a darkness lay on his forehead vast 
 but the light of expectancy o'er it was cast 
 a light that shone from the coming day 
 travelling unseen to the east away 
 in his cloudy robes that lay shadowing wide 
 i stretched myself motionless by his side 
 and his eyes with their calm , unimpassioned power 
 soothing my heart like an evening shower 
 led in a spectral , far billowing train 
 the hours of the past through my spirit again 

a wrinkled , crabb é d man they picture thee 
 old winter , with a rugged beard as gray 
 as the long moss upon the apple tree 
 blue lipt , an ice drop at thy sharp blue nose 
 close muffled up , and on thy dreary way 
 plodding alone through sleet and drifting snows 
 they should have drawn thee by the high heapt hearth 
 old winter ! seated in thy great armed chair 
 watching the children at their christmas mirth 
 or circled by them as thy lips declare 
 some merry jest , or tale of murder dire 
 or troubled spirit that disturbs the night 
 pausing at times to rouse the smouldering fire 
 or taste the old october brown and bright 

x . cease , then , nor order imperfection name 
 our proper bliss depends on what we blame 
 know thy own point : this kind , this due degree 
 of blindness , weakness , heaven bestows on thee 
 submit . in this , or any other sphere 
 secure to be as blest as thou canst bear 
 safe in the hand of one disposing power 
 or in the natal , or the mortal hour 
 all nature is but art , unknown to thee 
 all chance , direction , which thou canst not see 
 all discord , harmony not understood 
 all partial evil , universal good 
 and , spite of pride in erring reason 's spite 
 one truth is clear , whatever is , is right 

since last i saw that countenance so mild 
 slow stealing age , and a faint line of care 
 had gently touched , methought , some features there 
 yet looked the man as placid as a child 
 and the same voice ,— whilst mingled with the throng 
 unknowing , and unknown , we passed along 
 that voice , a share of the brief time beguiled 
 that voice i ne'er may hear again , i sighed 
 at parting ,— wheresoe'er our various way 
 in this great world ,— but from the banks of tweed 
 as slowly sink the shades of eventide 
 oh ! i shall hear the music of his reed 
 far off , and thinking of that voice , shall say 
 a blessing rest upon thy locks of gray 

what hast thou done , o womanhood of france 
 mother and daughter , sister , sweetheart , wife 
 what hast thou done , amid this fateful strife 
 to prove the pride of thine inheritance 
 in this fair land of freedom and romance 
 i hear thy voice with tears and courage rife 
 smiling against the swords that seek thy life 
 make answer in a noble utterance 
 “ i give france all i have , and all she asks 
 would it were more ! ah , let her ask and take 
 my hands to nurse her wounded , do her tasks 
 my feet to run her errands through the dark 
 my heart to bleed in triumph for her sake 
 and all my soul to follow thee , jeanne d'arc 

with wonder priam view ’ d the godlike man 
 extoll ’ d the happy prince , and thus began 
 “ o bless ’ d atrides ! born to prosperous fate 
 successful monarch of a mighty state 
 how vast thy empire ! of your matchless train 
 what numbers lost , what numbers yet remain 
 in phrygia once were gallant armies known 
 in ancient time , when otreus fill ’ d the throne 
 when godlike mygdon led their troops of horse 
 and i , to join them , raised the trojan force 
 against the manlike amazons we stood 
 and sangar ’ s stream ran purple with their blood 
 but far inferior those , in martial grace 
 and strength of numbers , to this grecian race 

the lad most gratefully his thanks returned 
 his breast with ev'ry soft emotion burned 
 within a week , to this sweet charmer came 
 a rich young squire , who soon declared his flame 
 on which she said to nicaise :— he will do 
 this spark will easily let matters through 
 and as the belle was confident of that 
 she gave consent and listened to his chat 
 soon all was settled and arranged the day 
 when marriage they no longer would delay 
 you 'll fully notice this :— i think i view 
 the thoughts which move around and you pursue 
 ‘ twas doubtless clear , whatever bliss in store 
 the lady was betrothed , and nothing more 

he sniffs the chilly air ; ( his dreaming starts 
 he 's riding in a dusty sussex lane 
 in quiet september ; slowly night departs 
 and he 's a living soul , absolved from pain 
 beyond the brambled fences where he goes 
 are glimmering fields with harvest piled in sheaves 
 and tree tops dark against the stars grown pale 
 then , clear and shrill , a distant farm cock crows 
 and there 's a wall of mist along the vale 
 where willows shake their watery sounding leaves 
 he gazes on it all , and scarce believes 
 that earth is telling its old peaceful tale 
 he thanks the blessed world that he was born 
 then , far away , a lonely note of the horn 

the lombard custom was , that when the king 
 who slept not with his queen , ( a common thing 
 in other countries too ) , desired to greet 
 his royal consort , and in bed to meet 
 a night gown solely o'er his back he threw 
 and then proceeded to the interview 
 knocked softly at the door , on which a fair 
 who waited on the queen with anxious care 
 allowed the prince to enter ; took his light 
 ( which only glimmered in the midst of night 
 then put it out , and quickly left the room 
 a little lantern to dispel the gloom 
 with waxen taper that emitted rays 
 in diff'rent countries various are their ways 

whoever thinks a faultless piece to see 
 thinks what ne'er was , nor is , nor e'er shall be 
 in every work regard the writer 's end 
 since none can compass more than they intend 
 and if the means be just , the conduct true 
 applause , in spight of trivial faults , is due 
 as men of breeding , sometimes men of wit 
 t ’ avoid great errors , must the less commit 
 neglect the rules each verbal critic lays 
 for not to know some trifles , is a praise 
 most critics , fond of some subservient art 
 still make the whole depend upon a part 
 they talk of principles , but notions prize 
 and all to one lov 'd folly sacrifice 

eastward was built a gate of marble white 
 the like adorn 'd the western opposite 
 a nobler object than this fabric was 
 rome never saw ; nor of so vast a space 
 for rich with spoils of many a conquer 'd land 
 all arts and artists theseus could command 
 who sold for hire , or wrought for better fame 
 the master painters , and the carvers came 
 so rose within the compass of the year 
 an age 's work , a glorious theatre 
 then o'er its eastern gate was raised above 
 a temple , sacred to the queen of love 
 an altar stood below : on either hand 
 a priest with roses crown 'd , who held a myrtle wand 

such prayers last year were put up for thy sake 
 what shall this year do that hath lived to see 
 the piteous and unpitied end of thee 
 what moan , what cry , what clamour shall it make 
 seeing as a reed breaks all thine empire break 
 and all thy great strength as a rotten tree 
 whose branches made broad night from sea to sea 
 and the world shuddered when a leaf would shake 
 from the unknown deep wherein those prayers were heard 
 from the dark height of time there sounds a word 
 crying , comfort ; though death ride on this red hour 
 hope waits with eyes that make the morning dim 
 till liberty , reclothed with love and power 
 shall pass and know not if she tread on him 

sweet cytherea , sitting by a brook 
 with young adonis , lovely , fresh , and green 
 did court the lad with many a lovely look 
 such looks as none could look but beauty 's queen 
 she told him stories to delight his ear 
 she show 'd him favours to allure his eye 
 to win his heart , she touch 'd him here and there 
 touches so soft still conquer chastity 
 but whether unripe years did want conceit 
 or he refus 'd to take her figur 'd proffer 
 the tender nibbler would not touch the bait 
 but smile and jest at every gentle offer 
 then fell she on her back , fair queen , and toward 
 he rose and ran away ; ah , fool too froward 

hail , twilight , sovereign of one peaceful hour 
 not dull art thou as undiscerning night 
 but studious only to remove from sight 
 day 's mutable distinctions .— ancient power 
 thus did the waters gleam , the mountains lower 
 to the rude briton , when , in wolf skin vest 
 here roving wild , he laid him down to rest 
 on the bare rock , or through a leafy bower 
 looked ere his eyes were closed . by him was seen 
 the self same vision which we now behold 
 at thy meek bidding , shadowy power ! brought forth 
 these mighty barriers , and the gulf between 
 the flood , the stars ,— a spectacle as old 
 as the beginning of the heavens and earth 

o silent lover of a world day worn 
 taking the weary light to thy dusk arms 
 stealing where pale forms lie , sun hurt and torn 
 waiting the balm of thy oblivious charms 
 make me thy captive ere i guess pursuit 
 and cast me deep within some dreamless close 
 where hopes stir not , and white , wronged lips are mute 
 and pain 's hot wings fold down o'er hush è d woes 
 and if ere morn thou choosest me to free 
 let it not be , dear jailer , through the door 
 that timeward opes , but to eternity 
 set thou the soul that needs thee nevermore 
 so i from sleep to death may softly wend 
 as one would pass from gentle friend to friend 

thou , nature ! partial nature , i arraign 
 of thy caprice maternal i complain 
 the lion and the bull thy care have found 
 one shakes the forests , and one spurns the ground 
 thou giv'st the ass his hide , the snail his shell 
 th ’ envenom 'd wasp , victorious , guards his cell 
 thy minions kings defend , control , devour 
 in all th ’ omnipotence of rule and power 
 foxes and statesmen subtile wiles ensure 
 the cit and polecat stink , and are secure 
 toads with their poison , doctors with their drug 
 the priest and hedgehog in their robes , are snug 
 ev'n silly woman has her warlike arts 
 her tongue and eyes — her dreaded spear and darts 

many the wonders i this day have seen 
 the sun , when first he kist away the tears 
 that fill 'd the eyes of morn ;— the laurel 'd peers 
 who from the feathery gold of evening lean 
 the ocean with its vastness , its blue green 
 its ships , its rocks , its caves , its hopes , its fears 
 its voice mysterious , which whoso hears 
 must think on what will be , and what has been 
 e'en now , dear george , while this for you i write 
 cynthia is from her silken curtains peeping 
 so scantly , that it seems her bridal night 
 and she her half discover 'd revels keeping 
 but what , without the social thought of thee 
 would be the wonders of the sky and sea 

the castle gate stands open now 
 and the wanderer is welcome to the hall 
 as the hangbird is to the elm tree bough 
 no longer scowl the turrets tall 
 the summer 's long siege at last is o'er 
 when the first poor outcast went in at the door 
 she entered with him in disguise 
 and mastered the fortress by surprise 
 there is no spot she loves so well on ground 
 she lingers and smiles there the whole year round 
 the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land 
 has hall and bower at his command 
 and there 's no poor man in the north countree 
 but is lord of the earldom as much as he 

thy followers too , old europe 's noblest pride 
 when future gales shall wing them o'er the tide 
 a ruddier hue and deeper shade shall gain 
 and stalk , in statelier figures , on the plain 
 while nature 's grandeur lifts the eye abroad 
 o'er these last labors of the forming god 
 wing 'd on a wider glance the venturous soul 
 bids greater powers and bolder thoughts unrol 
 the sage , the chief , the patriot unconfined 
 shield the weak world and meliorate mankind 
 but think not thou , in all the range of man 
 that different pairs each different cast began 
 or tribes distinct , by signal marks confest 
 were born to serve or subjugate the rest 

what viewed i , dear , when i thine eyes beheld 
 love in his glory ? no , him thyrsis saw 
 and stood the boy , whilst he his darts did draw 
 whose painted pride to baser swains he telled 
 saw i two suns ? that sight is seen but seld 
 yet can their brood that teach the holy law 
 gaze on their beams , and dread them not a straw 
 where princely looks are by their eyes repelled 
 what saw i then ? doubtless it was amen 
 armed with strong thunder and a lightning 's flame 
 who bridegroom like with power was riding then 
 meaning that none should see him when he came 
 yet did i gaze ; and thereby caught the wound 
 which burns my heart and keeps my body sound 

angel of thought , meseems god winged thee so 
 and crowned thine head with passion fine as flame 
 and made thy lifted face too pure for shame 
 with eyes and brow a mirror to his glow 
 and gave thy lips a golden trump , that , though 
 long years have passed since other angels came 
 to work the mighty wonders of his name 
 in god 's own name and man 's , thyself shalt go 
 forever on strong pinions to and fro 
 and round the earth reverberating blow 
 the mute , world shaking music of the mind 
 that thou might'st make as naught all space and time 
 and thrill in mystic oneness through mankind 
 yet dwell in each , inviolate , sublime 

the squire had wished his trusty man , no doubt 
 had not , at cudgelling , been quite so stout 
 but since he showed himself so true a friend 
 and with his actions could such prudence blend 
 the master fully pardoned what he knew 
 and quickly to his wife in bed he flew 
 when he related every thing that passed 
 were we , cried he , a hundred years to last 
 my lovely dear , we ne'er on earth could find 
 a man so faithful , and so well inclined 
 i 'd have him take within our town a wife 
 and you and i 'll regard him during life 
 in that , replied the lady , we agree 
 and heartily thereto i pledged will be 

did you but know the virtuous steps she trod 
 while thus devoted to the little god 
 you 'd thank a hundred times the pow'rs above 
 that gave you such a child to bless your love 
 but many other customs there abound 
 the fair with perfect liberty are found 
 can go and come , whene'er the humour fits 
 no eunuch ( shadow like ) that never quits 
 but watches ev'ry movement :— always feared 
 no men , but who 've upon the chin a beard 
 your daughter from the first , their manners took 
 so easy is her ev'ry act and look 
 and truly to her honour i may say 
 she 's all accommodating ev'ry way 

some infidel , i fancy , in my ear 
 would whisper probabilities , i fear 
 are rather wanting to support the fact 
 however perfectly gallants may act 
 to gain a heart requires full many a day 
 if more be requisite i cannot say 
 ‘ tis not my plan to dupe or young or old 
 but such to me , howe'er the tale is told 
 and ariosto never truth forsakes 
 yet , if at ev'ry step a writer takes 
 he 's closely question 'd as to time and place 
 he ne'er can end his work with easy grace 
 to those , from whom just credence i receive 
 their tales i promise fully to believe 

beloved ! if i wander far and oft 
 from that which i believe , and feel , and know 
 thou wilt forgive , not with a sorrowing heart 
 but with a strengthened hope of better things 
 knowing that i , though often blind and false 
 to those i love , and oh , more false than all 
 unto myself , have been most true to thee 
 and that whoso in one thing hath been true 
 can be as true in all . therefore thy hope 
 may yet not prove unfruitful , and thy love 
 meet , day by day , with less unworthy thanks 
 whether , as now , we journey hand in hand 
 or , parted in the body , yet are one 
 in spirit and the love of holy things 

no otherwise than raynie cloud , first fed 
 with earthly vapours gathered in the ayre 
 eftsoones in compas arch't , to steepe his hed 
 doth plonge himselfe in tethys bosome faire 
 and , mounting up againe from whence he came 
 with his great bellie spreds the dimmed world 
 till at the last , dissolving his moist frame 
 in raine , or snowe , or haile , he forth is horld 
 this citie , which was first but shepheards shade 
 uprising by degrees , grewe to such height 
 that queene of land and sea her selfe she made 
 at last , not able to beare so great weight 
 her power , disperst , through all the world did vade 
 to shew that all in th'end to nought shall fade 

the clock chimed three , and we yet strayed at will 
 about the yard in morning dishabille 
 when aunt ruth came , with apron o'er her head 
 holding a letter in her hand , and said 
 “ here is a note , from vivian i opine 
 at least his servant brought it . and now , girls 
 you may think this is no concern of mine 
 but in my day young ladies did not go 
 till almost bed time roaming to and fro 
 in morning wrappers , and with tangled curls 
 the very pictures of forlorn distress 
 ‘ tis three o'clock , and time for you to dress 
 come ! read your note and hurry in , maurine 
 and make yourself fit object to be seen 

happy the maimed , the halt , the mad , the blind 
 all who , stamped separate by curtailing birth 
 owe no duty ’ s allegiance to mankind 
 nor stand a valuing in their scheme of worth 
 but i , whom fate , not nature , did curtail 
 by no exterior voidness being exempt 
 must bear accusing glances where i fail 
 fixed in the general orbit of contempt 
 fate , less than nature in being kind to lacking 
 giving the ill , shows not as outer cause 
 making our mock free will the mirror ’ s backing 
 which fate ’ s own acts as if in itself shows 
 and men , like children , seeing the image there 
 take place for cause and make our will fate bear 

‘ andromache ! my soul 's far better part 
 why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart 
 no hostile hand can antedate my doom 
 till fate condemns me to the silent tomb 
 fixed is the term to all the race of earth 
 and such the hard condition of our birth 
 no force can then resist , no flight can save 
 all sink alike , the fearful and the brave 
 no more — but hasten to thy tasks at home 
 there guide the spindle , and direct the loom 
 me glory summons to the martial scene 
 the field of combat is the sphere for men 
 where heroes war , the foremost place i claim 
 the first in danger as the first in fame 

then i again inquir 'd : “ where flow the streams 
 of phlegethon and lethe ? for of one 
 thou tell'st not , and the other of that shower 
 thou say'st , is form 'd . ” he answer thus return 'd 
 “ doubtless thy questions all well pleas 'd i hear 
 yet the red seething wave might have resolv 'd 
 one thou proposest . lethe thou shalt see 
 but not within this hollow , in the place 
 whither to lave themselves the spirits go 
 whose blame hath been by penitence remov 'd 
 he added : “ time is now we quit the wood 
 look thou my steps pursue : the margins give

the chief hung up :— the princess soon appeared 
 her spirits presently our champion cheered 
 the pirate scarcely had her bosom moved 
 no tears at least a marked affection proved 
 but , by her prayers she pardon sought to gain 
 for some who were not in the conflict slain 
 consoled the dying , and lamented those 
 who , by the sword , had closed their book of woes 
 then left the place without the least regret 
 where such adventures and alarms she 'd met 
 ‘ tis said , indeed , she presently forgot 
 the two gallants who last became her lot 
 and i can easily the fact believe 
 removed from sight , but few for lovers grieve 

this mighty empire hath but feet of clay 
 of all its ancient chivalry and might 
 our little island is forsaken quite 
 some enemy hath stolen its crown of bay 
 and from its hills that voice hath passed away 
 which spake of freedom : o come out of it 
 come out of it , my soul , thou art not fit 
 for this vile traffic house , where day by day 
 wisdom and reverence are sold at mart 
 and the rude people rage with ignorant cries 
 against an heritage of centuries 
 it mars my calm : wherefore in dreams of art 
 and loftiest culture i would stand apart 
 neither for god , nor for his enemies 

look in my face ; my name is might have been 
 i am also called no more , too late , farewell 
 unto thine ear i hold the dead sea shell 
 cast up thy life 's foam fretted feet between 
 unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen 
 which had life 's form and love 's , but by my spell 
 is now a shaken shadow intolerable 
 of ultimate things unuttered the frail screen 
 mark me , how still i am ! but should there dart 
 one moment through thy soul the soft surprise 
 of that winged peace which lulls the breath of sighs 
 then shalt thou see me smile , and turn apart 
 thy visage to mine ambush at thy heart 
 sleepless with cold commemorative eyes 

just in the dubious point , where with the pool 
 is mixed the trembling stream , or where it boils 
 around the stone , or from the hollowed bank 
 reverted plays in undulating flow 
 there throw , nice judging , the delusive fly 
 and as you lead it round in artful curve 
 with eye attentive mark the springing game 
 straight as above the surface of the flood 
 they wanton rise , or urged by hunger leap 
 then fix , with gentle twitch , the barbed hook 
 some lightly tossing to the grassy bank 
 and to the shelving shore slow dragging some 
 with various hand proportioned to their force 
 the seasons : spring . j. thomson 

this bronze our lincoln 's noble head doth bear 
 behold the strength and splendor of that face 
 so homely beautiful , with just a trace 
 of humor lightening its look of care 
 with bronze indeed his memory doth share 
 this martyr who found freedom for a race 
 both shall endure beyond the time and place 
 that knew them first , and brighter grow with wear 
 happy must be the genius here that wrought 
 these features of the great american 
 whose fame lends so much glory to our past 
 happy to know the inspiration caught 
 from this most human and heroic man 
 lives here to honor him while art shall last 

oh , my beloved , have you thought of this 
 how in the years to come unscrupulous time 
 more cruel than death , will tear you from my kiss 
 and make you old , and leave me in my prime 
 how you and i , who scale together yet 
 a little while the sweet , immortal height 
 no pilgrim may remember or forget 
 as sure as the world turns , some granite night 
 shall lie awake and know the gracious flame 
 gone out forever on the mutual stone 
 and call to mind that on the day you came 
 i was a child , and you a hero grown 
 and the night pass , and the strange morning break 
 upon our anguish for each other 's sake 

if my dear love were but the child of state 
 it might for fortune 's bastard be unfathered 
 as subject to time 's love or to time 's hate 
 weeds among weeds , or flowers with flowers gathered 
 no it was builded far from accident 
 it suffers not in smiling pomp , nor falls 
 under the blow of thralled discontent 
 whereto th ’ inviting time our fashion calls 
 it fears not policy that heretic 
 which works on leases of short numbered hours 
 but all alone stands hugely politic 
 that it nor grows with heat , nor drowns with showers 
 to this i witness call the fools of time 
 which die for goodness , who have lived for crime 

the merry cuckow , messenger of spring 
 his trompet shrill hath thrise already sounded 
 that warnes al lovers wayte upon their king 
 who now is coming forth with girland crouned 
 with noyse whereof the quyre of byrds resounded 
 their anthemes sweet , devized of loves prayse 
 that all the woods theyr ecchoes back rebounded 
 as if they knew the meaning of their layes 
 but mongst them all which did loves honor rayse 
 no word was heard of her that most it ought 
 but she his precept proudly disobayes 
 and doth his ydle message set at nought 
 therefore , o love , unlesse she turne to thee

not with libations , but with shouts and laughter 
 we drenched the altars of love 's sacred grove 
 shaking to earth green fruits , impatient after 
 the launching of the colored moths of love 
 love 's proper myrtle and his mother 's zone 
 we bound about our irreligious brows 
 and fettered him with garlands of our own 
 and spread a banquet in his frugal house 
 not yet the god has spoken ; but i fear 
 though we should break our bodies in his flame 
 and pour our blood upon his altar , here 
 henceforward is a grove without a name 
 a pasture to the shaggy goats of pan 
 whence flee forever a woman and a man 

then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes 
 and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he 
 remembered in what a haughtier guise 
 he had flung an alms to leprosie 
 when he girt his young life up in gilded mail 
 and set forth in search of the holy grail 
 the heart within him was ashes and dust 
 he parted in twain his single crust 
 he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink 
 and gave the leper to eat and drink 
 ‘ t was a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread 
 ‘ t was water out of a wooden bowl 
 yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed 
 and ‘ t was red wine he drank with his thirsty soul 

“ long as ‘ t is lawful for me , shall my steps 
 follow on thine ; and since the cloudy smoke 
 forbids the seeing , hearing in its stead 
 shall keep us join 'd . ” i then forthwith began 
 “ yet in my mortal swathing , i ascend 
 to higher regions , and am hither come 
 through the fearful agony of hell 
 and , if so largely god hath doled his grace 
 that , clean beside all modern precedent 
 he wills me to behold his kingly state 
 from me conceal not who thou wast , ere death 
 had loos 'd thee ; but instruct me : and instruct 
 if rightly to the pass i tend ; thy words 
 the way directing as a safe escort 

“ the barley harvest was nodding white 
 when my children died on the rocky height 
 and the reapers were singing on hill and plain 
 when i came to my task of sorrow and pain 
 but now the season of rain is nigh 
 the sun is dim in the thickening sky 
 and the clouds in sullen darkness rest 
 where he hides his light at the doors of the west 
 i hear the howl of the wind that brings 
 the long drear storm on its heavy wings 
 but the howling wind and the driving rain 
 will beat on my houseless head in vain 
 i shall stay , from my murdered sons to scare 
 the beasts of the desert , and fowls of air 

shall christ hang on the cross , and we not look 
 heaven , earth , and hell stood gazing at the first 
 while christ for long cursed man was counted cursed 
 christ , god and man , whom god the father strook 
 and shamed and sifted and one while forsook 
 cry shame upon our bodies we have nursed 
 in sweets , our souls in pride , our spirits immersed 
 in wilfulness , our steps run all acrook 
 cry shame upon us ! for he bore our shame 
 in agony , and we look on at ease 
 with neither hearts on flame nor cheeks on flame 
 what hast thou , what have i , to do with peace 
 not to send peace but send a sword he came 
 and fire and fasts and tearful night watches 

i think that look of christ might seem to say 
 “ thou , peter ! art thou then a common stone 
 which i at last must break my heart upon 
 for all god 's charge to his high angels may 
 guard my foot better ? did i yesterday 
 wash thy feet , my beloved , that they should run 
 quick to deny me , ‘ neath the morning sun 
 and do thy kisses , like the rest , betray 
 the cock crows coldly . go and manifest 
 a late contrition , but no bootless fear 
 for when thy deadly need is bitterest 
 thou shall not be denied as i am here 
 my voice , to god and angels , shall attest 
 because i knew this man let him be clear 

‘ twas but a moment , for that respect 
 which clothes all courage their voices checked 
 and something the wildest could understand 
 spake in the old man 's strong right hand 
 and his corded throat , and the lurking frown 
 of his eyebrows under his old bell crown 
 until , as they gazed , there crept an awe 
 through the ranks in whispers , and some men saw 
 in the antique vestments and long white hair 
 the past of the nation in battle there 
 and some of the soldiers since declare 
 that the gleam of his old white hat afar 
 like the crested plume of the brave navarre 
 that day was their oriflamme of war 

as a decrepit father takes delight 
 to see his active child do deeds of youth 
 so i , made lame by fortune 's dearest spite 
 take all my comfort of thy worth and truth 
 for whether beauty , birth , or wealth , or wit 
 or any of these all , or all , or more 
 entitled in thy parts , do crowned sit 
 i make my love engrafted to this store 
 so then i am not lame , poor , nor despised 
 whilst that this shadow doth such substance give 
 that i in thy abundance am sufficed 
 and by a part of all thy glory live 
 look what is best , that best i wish in thee 
 this wish i have , then ten times happy me 

lo in the orient when the gracious light 
 lifts up his burning head , each under eye 
 doth homage to his new appearing sight 
 serving with looks his sacred majesty 
 and having climbed the steep up heavenly hill 
 resembling strong youth in his middle age 
 yet mortal looks adore his beauty still 
 attending on his golden pilgrimage 
 but when from highmost pitch with weary car 
 like feeble age he reeleth from the day 
 the eyes ( fore duteous ) now converted are 
 from his low tract and look another way 
 so thou , thy self out going in thy noon 
 unlooked on diest unless thou get a son 

a vast cathedral by the western sea 
 whose spires god set in majesty on high 
 peak after peak of forests to the sky 
 blended in one vast roof of greenery 
 the nave , a river broadening to the sea 
 the aisles , deep canyons of eternal build 
 the transepts , valleys with god 's splendor filled 
 the shrines , white waterfalls in leaf laced drapery 
 the choir stands westward by the sounding shore 
 the cliffs like beetling pipes set high in air 
 roll from the beach the thunders crashing there 
 the high wind voices chord the breakers ’ roar 
 and wondrous harmonies of praise and prayer 
 swell to the forest altars evermore 

how can i thank thee for this gift of thine 
 digby , the dawn and day star of our age 
 forerunner thou of many a saint and sage 
 who since have fought and conquer 'd ‘ neath the sign 
 thou hast left , as in a sacred shrine 
 what shrine more pure than thy unspotted page 
 the priceless relics , as a heritage 
 of loftiest thoughts and lessons most divine 
 poet and teacher of sublimest lore 
 thou scornest not the painter 's mimic skill 
 and thus hath come , obedient to thy will 
 the outward form that calderon 's spirit wore 
 ah ! happy canvas that two glories fill 
 where calderon lives ‘ neath digby 's hand once more 

the rolling wheele that runneth often round 
 the hardest steele , in tract of time doth teare 
 and drizling drops , that often doe redound 
 the firmest flint doth in continuance weare 
 yet cannot i , with many a drooping teare 
 and long intreaty , soften her hard hart 
 that she will once vouchsafe my plaint to heare 
 or looke with pitty on my payneful smart 
 but when i pleade , she bids me play my part 
 and when i weep , she sayes , teares are but water 
 and when i sigh , she sayes , i know the art 
 and when i waile , she turnes hir selfe to laughter 
 so do i weepe , and wayle , and pleade in vaine 
 whiles she as steele and flint doth still remayne 

‘ in this poor gown my dear lord found me first 
 and loved me serving in my father 's hall 
 in this poor gown i rode with him to court 
 and there the queen arrayed me like the sun 
 in this poor gown he bad me clothe myself 
 when now we rode upon this fatal quest 
 of honour , where no honour can be gained 
 and this poor gown i will not cast aside 
 until himself arise a living man 
 and bid me cast it . i have griefs enough 
 pray you be gentle , pray you let me be 
 i never loved , can never love but him 
 yea , god , i pray you of your gentleness 
 he being as he is , to let me be 

then i again inquir 'd : “ where flow the streams 
 of phlegethon and lethe ? for of one 
 thou tell'st not , and the other of that shower 
 thou say'st , is form 'd . ” he answer thus return 'd 
 “ doubtless thy questions all well pleas 'd i hear 
 yet the red seething wave might have resolv 'd 
 one thou proposest . lethe thou shalt see 
 but not within this hollow , in the place 
 whither to lave themselves the spirits go 
 whose blame hath been by penitence remov 'd 
 he added : “ time is now we quit the wood

 safe passage , unimpeded by the flames 
 for over them all vapour is extinct 

his beat lies knee high through a dust of story 
 a dust of terror and torture , grief and crime 
 ghosts that are england 's wonder , and shame , and glory 
 throng where he walks , an antic of old time 
 a sense of long immedicable tears 
 were ever with him , could his ears but heed 
 the stern hic jacets of our bloodiest years 
 are for his reading , had he eyes to read 
 but here , where crookback raged , and cranmer trimmed 
 and more and strafford faced the axe 's proving 
 he shows that crown the desperate colonel nimmed 
 or simply keeps the country cousin moving 
 or stays such cockney pencillers as would shame 
 the wall where some dead queen hath traced her name 

yet , oh ! believe me , mid this mingled maze 
 of nature 's beauties , where the fancy strays 
 from charm to charm , where every floweret 's hue 
 hath something strange , and every leaf is new 
 i never feel a joy so pure and still 
 so inly felt , as when some brook or hill 
 or veteran oak , like those remembered well 
 some mountain echo or some wild flower 's smell 
 ( for , who can say by what small fairy ties 
 the memory clings to pleasure as it flies 
 reminds my heart of many a silvan dream 
 i once indulged by trent 's inspiring stream 
 of all my sunny morns and moonlight nights 
 on donington 's green lawns and breezy heights 

ye , who by the couches of languishing ones 
 have watched through the rising and setting of suns 
 who , silent , behind the close curtain , withdrawn 
 scarce know that the current of being sweeps on 
 to whom outer life is unreal , untrue 
 a world with whose moils ye have nothing to do 
 who feel that the day , with its multiform rounds 
 is full of discordant , impertinent sounds 
 who speak in low whispers , and stealthily tread 
 as if a faint footfall were something to dread 
 who find all existence ,— its gladness , its gloom 
 enclosed by the walls of that limited room 
 ye only can measure the sleepless unrest 
 that lies like a night mare on alice 's breast 

how well this man unfolded to our view 
 the world 's beliefs of death and heaven and hell 
 this man whose own convictions none could tell 
 nor if his maze of reason had a clew 
 dogmas he wrote for daily bread , but knew 
 the fair philosophies of doubt so well 
 that while we listened to his words there fell 
 some that were strangely comforting , though true 
 marking how wise we grew upon his doubt 
 we said : “ if so , by groping in the night 
 he can proclaim some certain paths of trust 
 how great our profit if he saw about 
 his feet the highways leading to the light 
 now he sees all . ah , christ ! his mouth is dust 

o great and wise , clear souled and high of heart 
 one the last flower of catholic love , that grows 
 amid bare thorns their only thornless rose 
 from the fierce juggling of the priests ’ loud mart 
 yet alien , yet unspotted and apart 
 from the blind hard foul rout whose shameless shows 
 mock the sweet heaven whose secret no man knows 
 with prayers and curses and the soothsayer 's art 
 one like a storm god of the northern foam 
 strong , wrought of rock that breasts and breaks the sea 
 and thunders back its thunder , rhyme for rhyme 
 answering , as though to outroar the tides of time 
 and bid the world 's wave back — what song should be 
 theirs that with praise would bring and sing you home 

with the same heart , i said , i 'll answer thee 
 as those , when thou shalt call me by my name 
 lo , the vain promise ! is the same , the same 
 perplexed and ruffled by life 's strategy 
 when called before , i told how hastily 
 i dropped my flowers or brake off from a game 
 to run and answer with the smile that came 
 at play last moment , and went on with me 
 through my obedience . when i answer now 
 i drop a grave thought , break from solitude 
 yet still my heart goes to thee — ponder how 
 not as to a single good , but all my good 
 lay thy hand on it , best one , and allow 
 that no child 's foot could run fast as this blood 

home from her convent to the palace came 
 the lovely princess emma , whose sweet name 
 whispered by seneschal or sung by bard 
 had often touched the soul of eginhard 
 he saw her from his window , as in state 
 she came , by knights attended through the gate 
 he saw her at the banquet of that day 
 fresh as the morn , and beautiful as may 
 he saw her in the garden , as she strayed 
 among the flowers of summer with her maid 
 and said to him , “ o eginhard , disclose 
 the meaning and the mystery of the rose 
 and trembling he made answer : “ in good sooth 
 its mystery is love , its meaning youth 

oh ! my black soul ! now thou art summoned 
 by sickness , death 's herald and champion 
 thou ‘ rt like a pilgrim which abroad hath done 
 treason , and durst not turn to whence he is fled 
 or like a thief , which , till death 's doom be read 
 wisheth himself delivered from prison 
 but damn 'd , and haul 'd to execution 
 wisheth that still he might be imprisoned 
 yet grace , if thou repent , thou canst not lack 
 but who shall give thee that grace to begin 
 oh ! make thyself with holy mourning black 
 and red with blushing , as thou art with sin 
 or wash thee in christ 's blood , which hath this might 
 that , being red , it dyes red souls to white 

far in the void of heaven a secret way 
 leads from the mansions of empyreal day 
 that wanders devious from the road of light 
 and deepens gradual into central night 
 by this dim path he sought the dark profound 
 of utmost hell , creation 's flaming bound 
 saw the far distant gleam , and heard the roar 
 of dashing surges on the burning shore 
 with hasty steps he trod the deep descent 
 thro ’ the gross air , that brighten 'd as he went 
 and call 'd a spirit from the gulphs below 
 heaven 's scourge , and minister of human woe 
 the summon 'd fiend forsook the fiery wave 
 and sweden 's genius thus his mandate gave 

“ what traveller soever wander here 
 in quest of peace and what is best of pleasure 
 let not his hope be overcast and drear 
 because i , death , am here to fix the measure 
 of life , even in blameless arcady 
 bay , laurel , myrtle , ivy never sere 
 and fields flower decorated all the year 
 and streams that carry secrets to the sea 
 and hills that hold back something evermore 
 though wild their speech with clouds in thunder roar 
 yea , every sylvan sight and peaceful tone 
 are thine to give thy days their purer zest 
 let not the legend grieve thee on this stone 
 i death am here . what then ? my name is rest 

did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye 
 ‘ gainst whom the world could not hold argument 
 persuade my heart to this false perjury 
 vows for thee broke deserve not punishment 
 a woman i forswore ; but i will prove 
 thou being a goddess , i forswore not thee 
 my vow was earthly , thou a heavenly love 
 thy grace being gain 'd cures all disgrace in me 
 my vow was breath , and breath a vapour is 
 then , thou fair sun , that on this earth doth shine 
 exhale this vapour vow ; in thee it is 
 if broken , then it is no fault of mine 
 if by me broke , what fool is not so wise 
 to break an oath , to win a paradise 

in yonder cot , along whose mouldering walls 
 in many a fold the mantling woodbine falls 
 the village matron kept her little school 
 gentle of heart , yet knowing well to rule 
 staid was the dame , and modest was her mien 
 her garb was coarse , yet whole , and nicely clean 
 her neatly border 'd cap , as lily fair 
 beneath her chin was pinn 'd with decent care 
 and pendent ruffles , of the whitest lawn 
 of ancient make , her elbows did adorn 
 faint with old age , and dim were grown her eyes 
 a pair of spectacles their want supplies 
 these does she guard secure , in leathern case 
 from thoughtless wights , in some unweeted place 

yes , childhood , thee no rankling woes pursue 
 no forms of future ill salute thy view 
 no pangs repentant bid thee wake to weep 
 but halcyon peace protects thy downy sleep 
 and sanguine hope , through every storm of life 
 shoots her bright beams , and calms the internal strife 
 yet e'en round childhood 's heart , a thoughtless shrine 
 affection 's little thread will ever twine 
 and though but frail may seem each tender tie 
 the soul foregoes them but with many a sigh 
 thus , when the long expected moment came 
 when forced to leave the gentle hearted dame 
 reluctant throbbings rose within my breast 
 and a still tear my silent grief express 'd 

and so the empty handed years went round 
 vacant , though voiceful with prophetic sound 
 and so , that summer morn , he sat and mused 
 with folded , patient hands , as he was used 
 and dreamily before his half closed sight 
 floated the vision of his lost delight 
 beside him , motionless , the drowsy bird 
 dreamed of the chase , and in his slumber heard 
 the sudden , scythe like sweep of wings , that dare 
 the headlong plunge thro ’ eddying gulfs of air 
 then , starting broad awake upon his perch 
 tinkled his bells , like mass bells in a church 
 and , looking at his master , seemed to say 
 “ ser federigo , shall we hunt to day 

what say'st thou , dobbin ? what though hounds await 
 with open jaws the moment of thy fate 
 no better fate attends his public race 
 his life is misery , and his end disgrace 
 then freely bear thy burden to the mill 
 obey but one short law ,... thy driver 's will 
 affection , to thy memory ever true 
 shall boast of mighty loads that dobbin drew 
 and back to childhood shall the mind with pride 
 recount thy gentleness in many a ride 
 to pond , or field , or village fair , when thou 
 held'st high thy braided mane and comely brow 
 and oft the tale shall rise to homely fame 
 upon thy gen'rous spirit and thy name 

the monarch now ascends the sacred dome 
 the sun 's fixt image there partakes the gloom 
 thro all the shrines , where erst on new moon day 
 swell 'd the full quires of consecrated praise 
 a tomb like silence reigns ; till female cries 
 burst forth at last , and these sad accents rise 
 was it for this , my son to distant lands 
 must trace the wilds , and tempt those lawless bands 
 and does the god obscure his golden throne 
 in mournful darkness for my slaughter 'd son 
 oh , had his beam ; ere that disastrous day 
 that call 'd the youth from these fond arms away 
 received my spirit to its native sky 
 that sad oella might have seen him die 

daughter of her whose face , and lofty name 
 prenuptial , of old states and cities speak 
 where lands of wine look north to peak on peak 
 of the overwatching alps : through her , you claim 
 kinship with vanished power , unvanished fame 
 and midst a world grown colorless and bleak 
 i see the blood of doges in your cheek 
 and in your hair the titian tints of flame 
 daughter of england too , you first drew breath 
 where our coy springs to our coy summers yield 
 and you descend from one whose lance and shield 
 were with the grandsire of elizabeth 
 when the plantagenet saw the avenger death 
 toward him spurring over bosworth field 

if faithful souls be alike glorified 
 as angels , then my father 's soul doth see 
 and adds this even to full felicity 
 that valiantly i hell 's wide mouth o'erstride 
 but if our minds to these souls be descried 
 by circumstances and by signs that be 
 apparent in us — not immediately 
 how shall my mind 's white truth by them be tried 
 they see idolatrous lovers weep and mourn 
 and , style blasphemous , conjurors to call 
 on jesu 's name , and pharisaical 
 dissemblers feign devoti ö n . then turn 
 o pensive soul , to god ; for he knows best 
 thy grief , for he put it into my breast 

scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn 
 and scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade 
 when cytherea , all in love forlorn 
 a longing tarriance for adonis made 
 under an osier growing by a brook 
 a brook where adon used to cool his spleen 
 hot was the day ; she hotter that did look 
 for his approach , that often there had been 
 anon he comes , and throws his mantle by 
 and stood stark naked on the brook 's green brim 
 the sun look 'd on the world with glorious eye 
 yet not so wistly as this queen on him 
 he , spying her , bounc 'd in , whereas he stood 
 o jove , quoth she , why was not i a flood 

yet , after peace has turned the clean white page 
 there shall be sorrow on the earth for years 
 abysmal grief , that has no eyes for tears 
 and youth that hobbles through the earth like age 
 but better to play this part upon life 's stage 
 than to aid structures that a tyrant rears 
 to live a stalwart hireling torn with fears 
 and shamed by feeding on a conqueror s wage 
 death , yea , a thousand deaths , were sweet in truth 
 rather than such ignoble life . god gave 
 being , and breath , and high resolve to youth 
 that it might be wrong 's master , not its slave 
 our road to freedom is the road to guns 
 go , arm your sons ! i say , go , arm your sons 

in all my wanderings round this world of care 
 in all my griefs — and god has given my share 
 i still had hopes , my latest hours to crown 
 amidst these humble bowers to lay me down 
 to husband out life 's taper at the close 
 and keep the flame from wasting by repose 
 i still had hopes , for pride attends us still 
 amidst the swains to show my book learned skill 
 around my fire an evening group to draw 
 and tell of all i felt , and all i saw 
 and , as an hare whom hounds and horns pursue 
 pants to the place from whence at first she flew 
 i still had hopes , my long vexations past 
 here to return — and die at home at last 

‘ tis holy ground ! the silent silver lights 
 and darks undreamed of , falling year by year 
 upon his sleep , in soft australian nights 
 are joys enough for him who lieth here 
 so sanctified with rest . we need not rear 
 the storied monument o'er such a spot 
 that soul , the first for whom the christian tear 
 was shed on austral soil , hath heritage 
 most ample ! let the ages wane with age 
 the grass which clothes this grave shall wither not 
 see yonder quiet lily ! have the blights 
 of many winters left it on a faded tomb 
 oh , peace ! its fellows , glad with green delights 
 shall gather round it deep eternal bloom 

o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem 
 by that sweet ornament which truth doth give 
 the rose looks fair , but fairer we it deem 
 for that sweet odour which doth in it live 
 the canker blooms have full as deep a dye 
 as the perfumed tincture of the roses 
 hang on such thorns , and play as wantonly 
 when summer 's breath their masked buds discloses 
 but for their virtue only is their show 
 they live unwoo 'd and unrespected fade 
 die to themselves . sweet roses do not so 
 of then sweet deaths are sweetest odours made 
 and so of you , beauteous and lovely youth 
 when that shall fade , my verse distils your truth 

o true , they have a cause , and woe for us 
 while still they have a cause too piteous 
 yet , happy for us when , their cause defined 
 they walk no longer with a stumbler blind 
 and quicken in the virtue of their cause 
 to think me a poor mouther of old saws 
 i wait the issue of a battling age 
 the toilers with your ‘ troughsters ’ now engage 
 instructing them , through their acutest sense 
 how close the dangers of indifference 
 already have my people shown their worth 
 more love they light , which folds the love of earth 
 that love to love of labour leads : thence love 
 of humankind — earth 's incense flung above 

the eye was shut in men ; the hearing ear 
 dull unto deafness ; nought but earthly things 
 had credence ; and no highest art that flings 
 a spirit radiance from it , like the spear 
 of the ice pointed mountain , lifted clear 
 in the nigh sunrise , had made skyey springs 
 of light in the clouds of dull imaginings 
 vain were the painter or the sculptor here 
 give man the listening heart , the seeing eye 
 give life ; let sea derived fountain well 
 within his spirit , infant waves , to tell 
 of the far ocean mysteries that lie 
 silent upon the horizon ,— evermore 
 falling in voices on the human shore 

it is not with a hope my feeble praise 
 can add one moment 's honor to thy own 
 that with thy mighty name i grace these lays 
 i seek to glorify myself alone 
 for that some precious favor thou hast shown 
 to my endeavor in a bygone time 
 and by this token i would have it known 
 thou art my friend , and friendly to my rhyme 
 it is my dear ambition now to climb 
 still higher in thy thought ,— if my bold pen 
 may thrust on contemplations more sublime 
 but i am thirsty for thy praise , for when 
 we gain applauses from the great in name 
 we seem to be partakers of their fame 

as due by many titles , i resign 
 myself to thee , o god ! first i was made 
 by thee , and for thee ; and when i was decayed 
 thy blood bought that , the which before was thine 
 i am thy son , made with thyself to shine 
 thy servant , whose pains thou hast still repaid 
 thy sheep , thine image ; and , till i betrayed 
 myself , a temple of thy spirit divine 
 why doth the devil then usurp on me 
 why doth he steal , nay , ravish , that 's thy right 
 except thou rise , and for thine own work fight 
 oh ! i shall soon despair , when i shall see 
 that thou lov'st mankind well , yet wilt not choose me 
 and satan hates me , yet is loth to lose me 

we cannot choose our sorrows . one there was 
 who , reverent of soul , and strong with trust 
 cried , ‘ god , though thou shouldst bow me to the dust 
 yet will i praise thy everlasting laws 
 beggared , my faith would never halt or pause 
 but sing thy glory , feasting on a crust 
 only one boon , one precious boon i must 
 demand of thee , o opulent great cause 
 let love stay with me , constant to the end 
 though fame pass by and poverty pursue 
 with freighted hold her life ship onward sailed 
 the world gave wealth , and pleasure , and a friend 
 unmarred by envy , and whose heart was true 
 but ere the sun reached midday , love had failed 

my love amazed did blush herself to see 
 pictured by art , all naked as she was 
 “ how could the painter know so much by me 
 or art effect what he hath brought to pass 
 it is not like he naked me hath seen 
 or stood so nigh for to observe so much 
 no , sweet ; his eyes so near have never been 
 nor could his hands by art have cunning such 
 i showed my heart , wherein you printed were 
 you , naked you , as here you painted are 
 in that my love your picture i must wear 
 and show't to all , unless you have more care 
 then take my heart , and place it with your own 
 so shall you naked never more be known 

even as upon a low and cloud domed day 
 when clouds are one cloud till the horizon 
 our thinking senses deem the sun away 
 and say «’ tis sunless » and « there is no sun 
 and yet the very day they wrong truth by 
 is of the unseen sun ’ s effluent essence 
 the very words do give themselves the lie 
 the very thought of absence comes from presence 
 even so deem we through good of what is evil 
 he speaks of light that speaks of absent light 
 and absent god , becoming present devil 
 is still the absent god by essence ’ right 
 the withdrawn cause by being withdrawn doth get 
 ( being thereby cause still ) the denied effect 

how anxious is the pensive parents ’ thought 
 how blest the lot of fondlings , early taught 
 joy strings her hours on pleasure 's golden twine 
 and fancy forms it to an endless line 
 but ah ! the charm must cease , or soon or late 
 when chicks and misses rise to woman 's state 
 the little tyrant grows in turn a slave 
 and feels the soft anxiety she gave 
 this truth , my pretty friend , an ancient sage 
 who wrote in tale and legend many a page 
 couch 'd in that age 's unaffected guise 
 when fables were the wisdom of the wise 
 to careless notes i 've tuned his gothic style 
 content , if you approve , and laura smile 

know then , whate'er of the world 's ancient store 
 whate'er of mimic art 's reflected scenes 
 with love and admiration thus inspire 
 attentive fancy , her delighted sons 
 in two illustrious orders comprehend 
 self taught : from him whose rustic toil the lark 
 cheers warbling , to the bard whose daring thoughts 
 range the full orb of being , still the form 
 which fancy worships , or sublime or fair 
 her votaries proclaim . i see them dawn 
 i see the radiant visions where they rise 
 more lovely than when lucifer displays 
 his glittering forehead through the gates of morn 
 to lead the train of phoebus and the spring 

not from the stars do i my judgement pluck 
 and yet methinks i have astronomy 
 but not to tell of good , or evil luck 
 of plagues , of dearths , or seasons ’ quality 
 nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell 
 pointing to each his thunder , rain and wind 
 or say with princes if it shall go well 
 by oft predict that i in heaven find 
 but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive 
 and constant stars in them i read such art 
 as truth and beauty shall together thrive 
 if from thy self , to store thou wouldst convert 
 or else of thee this i prognosticate 
 thy end is truth 's and beauty 's doom and date 

sweet is the rose , but growes upon a brere 
 sweet is the iunipeer ; but sharpe his bough 
 sweet is the eglantine , but pricketh nere 
 sweet is the firbloome , but his braunches rough 
 sweet is the cypresse , but his rynd is rough 
 sweet is the nut , but bitter is his pill 
 sweet is the broome flowre , but yet sowre enough 
 and sweet is moly , but his root is ill 
 so every sweet with soure is tempred still 
 that maketh it be coveted the more 
 for easie things , that may be got at will 
 most sorts of men doe set but little store 
 why then should i accompt of little paine 
 that endlesse pleasure shall unto me gaine 

if , when we meet , i 'm cropped in awkward style 
 by some uneven barber , then you smile 
 you smile , if , as it haps , my gown 's askew 
 if my shirt 's ragged while my tunic 's new 
 how , if my mind 's inconsequent , rejects 
 what late it longed for , what it loathed affects 
 shifts every moment , with itself at strife 
 and makes a chaos of an ordered life 
 builds castles up , then pulls them to the ground 
 keeps changing round for square and square for round 
 you smile not ; ‘ tis an every day affair 
 i need no doctor 's , no , nor keeper 's care 
 yet you 're my patron , and would blush to fail 
 in taking notice of an ill pared nail 

captain , or colonel , or knight in arms 
 whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize 
 if deed of honour did thee ever please 
 guard them , and him within protect from harms 
 he can requite thee ; for he knows the charms 
 that call fame on such gentle acts as these 
 and he can spread thy name o'er land and seas 
 whatever clime the sun 's bright circle warms 
 lift not thy spear against the muses ’ bower 
 the great emanthian conqueror bid spare 
 the house of pindarus , when temple and tower 
 went to the ground ; and the repeated air 
 of sad electra 's poet had the power 
 to save the athenian walls from ruin bare 

diodati — and i muse to tell the tale 
 this stubborn i , that love was wont despise 
 and make a laughter of his snares , unwise 
 am fallen — where honest feet will sometimes fail 
 not golden tresses , not a cheek vermeil 
 dazzle me thus ; but , in a new world guise 
 a foreign fair my heart beatifies 
 with mien where high souled modesty i hail 
 eyes softly splendent with a darkness dear 
 a speech that more than one tongue vassal hath 
 a voice that in the middle hemisphere 
 might make the tired moon wander from her path 
 while from her eyes such gracious flashes shoot 
 that stopping hard my ears were little boot 

thus from a mixture of all kinds began 
 that heterogeneous thing , an englishman 
 in eager rapes , and furious lust begot 
 betwixt a painted briton and a scot 
 whose gend'ring offspring quickly learn 'd to bow 
 and yoke their heifers to the roman plough 
 from whence a mongrel half bred race there came 
 with neither name nor nation , speech or fame 
 in whose hot veins new mixtures quickly ran 
 infused betwixt a saxon and a dane 
 while their rank daughters , to their parents just 
 received all nations with promiscuous lust 
 this nauseous brood directly did contain 
 the well extracted blood of englishmen 

it may be for the world of weeds and tares 
 and dearth in nature of sweet beauty 's rose 
 that oft as fortune from ten thousand shows 
 one from the train of love 's true courtiers 
 straightway on him who gazes , unawares 
 deep wonder seizes and swift trembling grows 
 reft by that sight of purpose and repose 
 hardly its weight his fainting breast upbears 
 then on the soul from some ancestral place 
 floods back remembrance of its heavenly birth 
 when , in the light of that serener sphere 
 it saw ideal beauty face to face 
 that through the forms of this our meaner earth 
 shines with a beam less steadfast and less clear 

many in aftertimes will say of you 
 “ he loved her ” — while of me what will they say 
 not that i loved you more than just in play 
 for fashion 's sake as idle women do 
 even let them prate ; who know not what we knew 
 of love and parting in exceeding pain 
 of parting hopeless here to meet again 
 hopeless on earth , and heaven is out of view 
 but by my heart of love laid bare to you 
 my love that you can make not void nor vain 
 love that foregoes you but to claim anew 
 beyond this passage of the gate of death 
 i charge you at the judgment make it plain 
 my love of you was life and not a breath 

eight hours ’ , ten hours ’ , twelve hours ’ shift 
 oh , it 's long and long the day is 
 up before light , and home in the night 
 that is our share in the desperate fight 
 and it 's long and long the day is 
 backs and arms and heads that ache 
 eyes over tired and legs that shake 
 and hearts full nigh to burst and break 
 oh , it 's long and long the day is 
 week in , week out , not a second to spare 
 but though it should kill us we 'll do our share 
 for the sake of the lads , who have gone out there 
 for the sake of us others , to do and dare 
 but it 's long and long the day is 

between the two white breasts of her we love 
 a dewy blushing rose will sometimes spring 
 thus nonnenwerth like an enchanted thing 
 rises mid stream the crystal depths above 
 on either side the waters heave and swell 
 but all is calm within the little isle 
 content it is to give its holy smile 
 and bless with peace the lives that in it dwell 
 most dear on the dark grass beneath its bower 
 of kindred trees embracing branch and bough 
 to dream of fairy foot and sudden flower 
 or haply with a twilight on the brow 
 to muse upon the legendary hour 
 and roland 's lonely love and hildegard 's sad vow 

the tide is rippling to my very feet 
 the mountains are before me , and around 
 stretching in misty grandeur till they meet 
 in one dim bourne , their hoary summits crown 'd 
 with cloudy chaplets , such as might have bound 
 the new born thunderer when saturn fell 
 all wonder stricken , from his mighty throne 
 the sun is shining upon wooded slopes 
 and distant headlands , with faint shadows thrown 
 amid its brightness like the shatter 'd hopes 
 of a young noontide , and its golden light 
 crests the upheaving waters till each swell 
 is tremulous with glory , and the sight 
 pictures strange fancies which no tongue can tell 

i reached the alps : the soul within me burned 
 italia , my italia , at thy name 
 and when from out the mountain 's heart i came 
 and saw the land for which my life had yearned 
 i laughed as one who some great prize had earned 
 and musing on the marvel of thy fame 
 i watched the day , till marked with wounds of flame 
 the turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned 
 the pine trees waved as waves a woman 's hair 
 and in the orchards every twining spray 
 was breaking into flakes of blossoming foam 
 but when i knew that far away at rome 
 in evil bonds a second peter lay 
 i wept to see the land so very fair 

x . doubtless thine eyes have watched the sun aspire 
 from that same olivet , when back on thee 
 flushed upwards after some night agony 
 thy proper godhead , with a purer fire 
 purpling thy infinite , and in strong desire 
 thou sattest in the dawn that was to be 
 uplifted on our dark perplexity 
 yea in thee lay thy soul , a living lyre 
 and each wild beauty smote it , though the sound 
 rung to the night winds oft and desert air 
 beneath thine eyes the lily paled more fair 
 and each still shadow slanting on the ground 
 lay sweetly on thee as commissioned there 
 so full wast thou of eyes all round and round 

methought his royal person did foretell 
 a kingly stateliness , from all pride clear 
 his look majestic seem è d to compel 
 all men to love him , rather than to fear 
 and yet though he were every good man 's joy 
 and the alonely comfort of his own 
 his very name with terror did annoy 
 his foreign foes so far as he was known 
 hell drooped for fear ; the turkey moon looked pale 
 spain trembled ; and the most tempestuous sea 
 ( where behemoth , the babylonish whale 
 keeps all his bloody and imperious plea 
 was swoln with rage , for fear he 'd stop the tide 
 of her o'erhyppphendaring and insulting pride 

thus toil ’ d the chiefs , in different parts engaged 
 in every quarter fierce tydides raged 
 amid the greek , amid the trojan train 
 rapt through the ranks he thunders o ’ er the plain 
 now here , now there , he darts from place to place 
 pours on the rear , or lightens in their face 
 thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong 
 deluge whole fields , and sweep the trees along 
 through ruin ’ d moles the rushing wave resounds 
 o ’ erwhelm ’ s the bridge , and bursts the lofty bounds 
 the yellow harvests of the ripen ’ d year 
 and flatted vineyards , one sad waste appear 
 while jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain 
 and all the labours of mankind are vain 

some say thy fault is youth , some wantonness 
 some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport 
 both grace and faults are loved of more and less 
 thou mak'st faults graces , that to thee resort 
 as on the finger of a throned queen 
 the basest jewel will be well esteemed 
 so are those errors that in thee are seen 
 to truths translated , and for true things deemed 
 how many lambs might the stern wolf betray 
 if like a lamb he could his looks translate 
 how many gazers mightst thou lead away 
 if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state 
 but do not so , i love thee in such sort 
 as thou being mine , mine is thy good report 

that thou hast her it is not all my grief 
 and yet it may be said i loved her dearly 
 that she hath thee is of my wailing chief 
 a loss in love that touches me more nearly 
 loving offenders thus i will excuse ye 
 thou dost love her , because thou know'st i love her 
 and for my sake even so doth she abuse me 
 suff'ring my friend for my sake to approve her 
 if i lose thee , my loss is my love 's gain 
 and losing her , my friend hath found that loss 
 both find each other , and i lose both twain 
 and both for my sake lay on me this cross 
 but here 's the joy , my friend and i are one 
 sweet flattery , then she loves but me alone 

how do i keep thee ? let me count the ways 
 i bar up every breadth and depth and height 
 my hands can reach , while feeling out of sight 
 for bolts that stick and hasps that will not raise 
 i keep thee from the public 's idle gaze 
 i keep thee in , by sun or candle light 
 i keep thee , rude , as women strive for right 
 i keep thee boldly , as they seek for praise 
 i keep thee with more effort than i 'd use 
 to keep a dry goods shop or big hotel 
 i keep thee with a power i seemed to lose 
 with that last cook . i 'll keep thee down the well 
 or up the chimney place ! or if i choose 
 i shall but keep thee in a pumpkin shell 

“ yon cottager , who weaves at her own door 
 pillow and bobbins all her little store 
 content though mean , and cheerful if not gay 
 shuffling her threads about the live long day 
 just earns a scanty pittance , and at night 
 lies down secure , her heart and pocket light 
 she , for her humble sphere by nature fit 
 has little understanding , and no wit 
 receives no praise ; but , though her lot be such 
 ( toilsome and indigent ) she renders much 
 just knows , and knows no more , her bible true 
 a truth the brilliant frenchman never knew 
 and in that charter reads with sparkling eyes 
 her title to a treasure in the skies 

o happy thames , that didst my stella bear 
 i saw thee with full many a smiling line 
 upon thy cheerful face joy 's livery wear 
 while those fair planets on thy streams did shine 
 the boat for joy could not to dance forbear 
 while wanton winds , with beauties so divine 
 ravish 'd , stay 'd not , till in her golden hair 
 they did themselves ( o sweetest prison !) twine 
 and fain those oeol 's youth there would their stay 
 have made ; but , forced by nature still to fly 
 first did with puffing kiss those locks display 
 she , so dishevell 'd , blush 'd . from window i 
 with sight thereof , cried out , ‘ o fair disgrace 
 let honour 's self to thee grant highest place 

“ not all ” — the echoes answer me — “ not all 
 prophetic sounds and loud , arise forever 
 from us , and from all ruin , unto the wise 
 as melody from memnon to the sun 
 we rule the hearts of mightiest men — we rule 
 with a despotic sway all giant minds 
 we are not impotent — we pallid stones 
 not all our power is gone — not all our fame 
 not all the magic of our high renown 
 not all the wonder that encircles us 
 not all the mysteries that in us lie 
 not all the memories that hang upon 
 and cling around about us as a garment 
 clothing us in a robe of more than glory 

care charmer sleep , son of the sable night 
 brother to death , in silent darkness born 
 relieve my languish , and restore the light 
 with dark forgetting of my care return 
 and let the day be time enough to mourn 
 the shipwreck of my ill adventured youth 
 let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn 
 without the torment of the night 's untruth 
 cease , dreams , the images of day desires 
 to model forth the passions of the morrow 
 never let rising sun approve you liars 
 to add more grief to aggravate my sorrow 
 still let me sleep , embracing clouds in vain 
 and never wake to feel the day 's disdain 

thou cam'st not to thy place by accident 
 it is the very place god meant for thee 
 and shouldst thou there small scope for action see 
 do not for this give room to discontent 
 nor let the time thou owest god be spent 
 in idle dreaming how thou mightest be 
 in what concerns thy spiritual life , more free 
 from outward hindrance or impediment 
 for presently this hindrance thou shalt find 
 that without which all goodness were a task 
 so slight that virtue never could grow strong 
 and wouldst thou do one duty to his mind 
 the imposer 's — over burdened thou shalt ask 
 and own thy need of , grace to help ere long 

giddings , far rougher names than thine have grown 
 smoother than honey on the lips of men 
 and thou shalt aye be honorably known 
 as one who bravely used his tongue and pen 
 as best befits a freeman ,— even for those 
 to whom our law 's unblushing front denies 
 a right to plead against the lifelong woes 
 which are the negro 's glimpse of freedom 's skies 
 fear nothing , and hope all things , as the right 
 alone may do securely ; every hour 
 the thrones of ignorance and ancient night 
 lose somewhat of their long usurp è d power 
 and freedom 's lightest word can make them shiver 
 with a base dread that clings to them forever 

as the blind man behind his leader walks 
 lest he should err , or stumble unawares 
 on what might harm him , or perhaps destroy 
 i journey 'd through that bitter air and foul 
 still list'ning to my escort 's warning voice 
 “ look that from me thou part not . ” straight i heard 
 voices , and each one seem 'd to pray for peace 
 and for compassion , to the lamb of god 
 that taketh sins away . their prelude still 
 was “ agnus dei , ” and through all the choir 
 one voice , one measure ran , that perfect seem 'd 
 the concord of their song . “ are these i hear 
 spirits , o master ? ” i exclaim 'd ; and he 
 “ thou aim'st aright : these loose the bonds of wrath 

like as ye see the wrathfull sea from farre 
 in a great mountaine heap't with hideous noyse 
 eftsoones of thousand billowes shouldred narre

 the approaching gales of adverse fortune sigh 
 and when affliction whets her keenest dart

 assured in the dark tides of the world that rest 
 and heard our word , ‘ who is so safe as we 
 we have found safety with all things undying 
 the winds , and morning , tears of men and mirth 
 the deep night , and birds singing , and clouds flying 
 and sleep , and freedom , and the autumnal earth 
 we have built a house that is not for time 's throwing 
 we have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever

 safe though all safety 's lost ; safe where men fall

the peasant ‘ gan to turn things in his mind 
 said he , to take the heads i 'm not inclined 
 no drink , you say , between ; that makes it worse 
 to eat the garlick thus , would prove a curse 
 nor can i suffer on my tender back 
 that , with a cudgel , thirty blows you thwack 
 still harder thirty pounds to pay appeared 
 uncertain how to act , he hanging feared 
 the noble peer he begged , upon his knees 
 his penitence to hear , and sentence ease 
 but mercy dwelled not with the angry lord 
 is this , cried he , the answer ?— bring a cord 
 the peasant , trembling lest his life was sought 
 the garlick chose , which presently was brought 

o opulent life of ours , though dispossessed 
 of treasure after treasure ! youth most fair 
 went first , but left its priceless coil of hair 
 moaned over sleepless nights , kissed and caressed 
 through drip and blur of tears the tenderest 
 and next went love — the ripe rose glowing there 
 her very sister !... it is here ; but where 
 is she , of all the world the first and best 
 and yet how sweet the sweet earth after rain 
 how sweet the sunlight on the garden wall 
 across the roses — and how sweetly flows 
 the limpid yodel of the brook again 
 and yet — and yet how sweeter after all 
 the smouldering sweetness of a dead red rose 

the wise do send their hearts before them to 
 dear bless é d heaven , despite the veil between 
 the foolish nurse their hearts within the screen 
 of this familiar world , where all we do 
 or have is old , for there is nothing new 
 yet elder far that world we have not seen 
 god 's presence antedates what else hath been 
 many the foolish seem , the wise seem few 
 oh foolishest fond folly of a heart 
 divided , neither here nor there at rest 
 that hankers after heaven , but clings to earth 
 that neither here nor there knows thorough mirth 
 half choosing , wholly missing , the good part 
 oh fool among the foolish , in thy quest 

in the lone tent , waiting for victory 
 she stands with eyes marred by the mists of pain 
 like some wan lily overdrenched with rain 
 the clamorous clang of arms , the ensanguined sky 
 war 's ruin , and the wreck of chivalry 
 to her proud soul no common fear can bring 
 bravely she tarrieth for her lord the king 
 her soul a flame with passionate ecstasy 
 o hair of gold ! o crimson lips ! o face 
 made for the luring and the love of man 
 with thee i do forget the toil and stress 
 the loveless road that knows no resting place 
 time 's straitened pulse , the soul 's dread weariness 
 my freedom , and my life republican 

such age , how beautiful ! o lady bright 
 whose mortal lineaments seem all refined 
 by favouring nature and a saintly mind 
 to something purer and more exquisite 
 than flesh and blood ; whene'er thou meet'est my sight 
 when i behold thy blanched unwithered cheek 
 thy temples fringed with locks of gleaming white 
 and head that droops because the soul is meek 
 thee with the welcome snowdrop i compare 
 that child of winter , prompting thoughts that climb 
 from desolation toward the genial prime 
 or with the moon conquering earth 's misty air 
 and filling more and more with crystal light 
 as pensive evening deepens into night 

he spoke and sate . the prince with transport flew 
 hung round his neck , while tears his cheek bedew 
 nor less the father pour 'd a social flood 
 they wept abundant , and they wept aloud 
 as the bold eagle with fierce sorrow stung 
 or parent vulture , mourns her ravish 'd young 
 they cry , they scream , their unfledged brood a prey 
 to some rude churl , and borne by stealth away 
 so they aloud : and tears in tides had run 
 their grief unfinish 'd with the setting sun 
 but checking the full torrent in its flow 
 the prince thus interrupts the solemn woe 
 “ what ship transported thee , o father , say 
 and what bless 'd hands have oar 'd thee on the way 

indeed this very love which is my boast 
 and which , when rising up from breast to brow 
 doth crown me with a ruby large enow 
 to draw men 's eyes and prove the inner cost 
 this love even , all my worth , to the uttermost 
 i should not love withal , unless that thou 
 hadst set me an example , shown me how 
 when first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed 
 and love called love . and thus , i cannot speak 
 of love even , as a good thing of my own 
 thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak 
 and placed it by thee on a golden throne 
 and that i love ( o soul , we must be meek 
 is by thee only , whom i love alone 

yet , lady , no — for song so rude as mine 
 chase not the wonders of your art divine 
 still , radiant eye , upon the canvas dwell 
 still , magic finger , weave your potent spell 
 and , while i sing the animated smiles 
 of fairy nature in these sun born isles 
 oh , might the song awake some bright design 
 inspire a touch , or prompt one happy line 
 proud were my soul , to see its humble thought 
 on painting 's mirror so divinely caught 
 while wondering genius , as he leaned to trace 
 the faint conception kindling into grace 
 might love my numbers for the spark they threw 
 and bless the lay that lent a charm to you 

blame not my heart for flying up so high 
 sith thou art cause that it this flight begun 
 for earthly vapours drawn up by the sun 
 comets become , and night suns in the sky 
 mine humble heart , so with thy heavenly eye 
 drawn up aloft , all low desires doth shun 
 raise thou me up , as thou my heart hast done 
 so during night in heaven remain may i 
 i say again , blame not my high desire 
 sith of us both the cause thereof depends 
 in thee doth shine , in me doth burn a fire 
 fire draws up other , and itself ascends 
 thine eye a fire , and so draws up my love 
 my love a fire , and so ascends above 

had i a man 's fair form , then might my sighs 
 be echoed swiftly through that ivory shell 
 thine ear , and find thy gentle heart ; so well 
 would passion arm me for the enterprize 
 but ah ! i am no knight whose foeman dies 
 no cuirass glistens on my bosom 's swell 
 i am no happy shepherd of the dell 
 whose lips have trembled with a maiden 's eyes 
 yet must i dote upon thee ,— call thee sweet 
 sweeter by far than hybla 's honied roses 
 when steep 'd in dew rich to intoxication 
 ah ! i will taste that dew , for me ‘ tis meet 
 and when the moon her pallid face discloses 
 i 'll gather some by spells , and incantation 

thou who didst make and knowest whereof we are made 
 oh bear in mind our dust and nothingness 
 our wordless tearless dumbness of distress 
 bear thou in mind the burden thou hast laid 
 upon us , and our feebleness unstayed 
 except thou stay us : for the long long race 
 which stretches far and far before our face 
 thou knowest ,— remember thou whereof we are made 
 if making makes us thine , then thine we are 
 and if redemption , we are twice thine own 
 if once thou didst come down from heaven afar 
 to seek us and to find us , how not save 
 comfort us , save us , leave us not alone 
 thou who didst die our death and fill our grave 

“ lords my barons , ” the emperor said 
 “ king marsil to me hath his envoys sped 
 he proffers treasure surpassing bounds 
 bears and lions , and leash è d hounds 
 seven hundred camels that bend the knee 
 a thousand hawks that have moulted free 
 four hundred mules with arab gold 
 which fifty wains might scantly hold 
 but he saith to france must i wend my way 
 he will follow to aix with brief delay 
 bend his heart unto christ 's belief 
 and hold his marches of me in fief 
 yet i know not what in his heart may lie 
 “ beware ! beware ! ” was the franks ’ outcry 

o nightingale that on yon bloomy spray 
 warblest at eve , when all the woods are still 
 thou with fresh hope the lover 's heart dost fill 
 while the jolly hours lead on propitious may 
 thy liquid notes that close the eye of day 
 first heard before the shallow cuckoo 's bill 
 portend success in love . o , if jove 's will 
 have linked that amorous power to thy soft lay 
 now timely sing , ere the rude bird of hate 
 foretell my hopeless doom , in some grove nigh 
 as thou from year to year hast sung too late 
 for my relief , yet hadst no reason why 
 whether the muse or love call thee his mate 
 both them i serve , and of their train am i 

care charmer sleep , son of the sable night 
 brother to death , in silent darkness born 
 relieve my anguish , and restore the light 
 with dark forgetting of my care , return 
 and let the day be time enough to mourn 
 the shipwreck of my ill advised youth 
 let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn 
 without the torments of the night 's untruth 
 cease , dreams , the images of day desires 
 to model forth the passions of to morrow 
 never let the rising sun prove you liars 
 to add more grief , to aggravate my sorrow 
 still let me sleep , embracing clouds in vain 
 and never wake to feel the day 's disdain 

the fine delight that fathers thought ; the strong 
 spur , live and lancing like the blowpipe flame 
 breathes once and , quench è d faster than it came 
 leaves yet the mind a mother of immortal song 
 nine months she then , nay years , nine years she long 
 within her wears , bears , cares and moulds the same 
 the widow of an insight lost she lives , with aim 
 now known and hand at work now never wrong 
 sweet fire the sire of muse , my soul needs this 
 i want the one rapture of an inspiration 
 o then if in my lagging lines you miss 
 the roll , the rise , the carol , the creation 
 my winter world , that scarcely breathes that bliss 
 now , yields you , with some sighs , our explanation 

beauty , sweet love , is like the morning dew 
 whose short refresh upon the tender green 
 cheers for a time but till the sun doth show 
 and straight ‘ tis gone as it had never been 
 soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish 
 short is the glory of the blushing rose 
 the hue which thou so carefully dost nourish 
 yet which at length thou must be forced to lose 
 when thou , surcharged with burden of thy years 
 shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth 
 and that in beauty 's lease expired appears 
 the date of age , the kalends of our death 
 but ah ! no more , this must not be foretold 
 for women grieve to think they must be old 

my glass shall not persuade me i am old 
 so long as youth and thou are of one date 
 but when in thee time 's furrows i behold 
 then look i death my days should expiate 
 for all that beauty that doth cover thee 
 is but the seemly raiment of my heart 
 which in thy breast doth live , as thine in me 
 how can i then be elder than thou art 
 o therefore love be of thyself so wary 
 as i not for my self , but for thee will 
 bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary 
 as tender nurse her babe from faring ill 
 presume not on thy heart when mine is slain 
 thou gav'st me thine not to give back again 

i , strengthened , left him . next in a close place 
 mid houses crowded , dingy , barred , and high 
 where men live not except to sell and buy 
 to me , leaving a doorway , came a grace 
 ( surely from heaven she came , though all that race 
 walketh on human feet beneath the sky 
 i , going on , beheld not who was nigh 
 when a sweet girl looked up into my face 
 with earnest eyes , most maidenly sedate 
 looked up to me , as i to him did look 
 ‘ twas much to me whom sometimes men mistook 
 she asked me where we dwelt , that she might wait 
 upon us there . i told her , and elate 
 went on my way to seek another nook 

woman ! when i behold thee flippant , vain 
 inconstant , childish , proud , and full of fancies 
 without that modest softening that enhances 
 the downcast eye , repentant of the pain 
 that its mild light creates to heal again 
 e'en then , elate , my spirit leaps , and prances 
 e'en then my soul with exultation dances 
 for that to love , so long , i 've dormant lain 
 but when i see thee meek , and kind , and tender 
 heavens ! how desperately do i adore 
 thy winning graces ;— to be thy defender 
 i hotly burn — to be a calidore 
 a very red cross knight — a stout leander 
 might i be loved by thee like these of yore 

dear unborn children , to our mother 's trust 
 we leave you , fearless , when we lie in dust 
 while o'er these walls the christian banner waves 
 from hallowed lips shall flow the truth that saves 
 while o'er those portals veritas you read 
 no church shall bind you with its human creed 
 take from the past the best its toil has won 
 but learn betimes its slavish ruts to shun 
 pass the old tree whose withered leaves are shed 
 quit the old paths that error loved to tread 
 and a new wreath of living blossoms seek 
 a narrower pathway up a loftier peak 
 lose not your reverence , but unmanly fear 
 leave far behind you , all who enter here 

you secret vales , you solitary fields 
 you shores forsaken and you sounding rocks 
 if ever groaning heart hath made you yield 
 or words half spoke that sense in prison locks 
 then ‘ mongst night shadows whisper out my death 
 that when myself hath sealed my lips from speaking 
 each tell tale echo with a weeping breath 
 may both record my truth and true love 's breaking 
 you pretty flowers that smile for summer 's sake 
 pull in your heads before my wat'ry eyes 
 do turn the meadows to a standing lake 
 by whose untimely floods your glory dies 
 for lo , mine heart , resolved to moistening air 
 feedeth mine eyes which double tear for tear 

the silent room , the heavy creeping shade 
 the dead that travel fast , the opening door 
 the murdered brother rising through the floor 
 the ghost 's white fingers on thy shoulders laid 
 and then the lonely duel in the glade 
 the broken swords , the stifled scream , the gore 
 thy grand revengeful eyes when all is o'er 
 these things are well enough ,    but thou wert made 
 for more august creation ! frenzied lear 
 should at thy bidding wander on the heath 
 with the shrill fool to mock him , romeo 
 for thee should lure his love , and desperate fear 
 pluck richard 's recreant dagger from its sheath   
 thou trumpet set for shakespeare 's lips to blow 

next rattling dice invite th ’ attentive ear 
 lords loudly laugh , as loud the bullies swear 
 the country knight o'th ’ shire sells his estate 
 and here with heart intrepid meets his fate 
 so they withdrew to quench their glowing flame 
 and to preserve the honour of her name 
 for oh ! sad fate as they ascend the stairs 
 at the room door her good mamma appears 
 soon as she spies her child with looks demure 
 she charges her to keep her vessel pure 
 miss pertly answers to avoid her doom 
 mamma , whose hat and wig is in the room 
 the good old dame yeilds at the just reproach 
 cries — well my dear , do n't take too much 

a rose , as fair as ever saw the north 
 grew in a little garden all alone 
 a sweeter flower did nature ne'er put forth 
 nor fairer garden yet was never known 
 the maidens danc 'd about it morn and noon 
 and learned bards of it their ditties made 
 the nimble fairies by the pale faced moon 
 water 'd the root and kiss 'd her pretty shade 
 but well a day , the gard'ner careless grew 
 the maids and fairies both were kept away 
 and in a drought the caterpillars threw 
 themselves upon the bud and every spray 
 god shield the stock ! if heaven send no supplies 
 the fairest blossom of the garden dies 

she said ; nor man nor woman then was left 
 within the city ; o'er the minds of all 
 grief pass 'd , resistless ; to the gates in throngs 
 they press 'd , to crowd round him who brought the dead 
 the first to clasp the body were his wife 
 and honour 'd mother ; eagerly they sprang 
 on the smooth rolling wain , to touch the head 
 of hector ; round them , weeping , stood the crowd 
 weeping , till sunset , all the live long day 
 had they before the gates for hector mourn 'd 
 had not old priam from the car address 'd 
 the crowd : “ make way , that so the mules may pass 
 when to my house i shall have brought my dead 
 ye there may vent your sorrow as ye will 

then spake the lad : “ and once i saw a host 
 of men pass by the borders of the wood 
 a glitter in the sun , and riding fast 
 on splendid creatures , prancing as they went 
 oh , i would fain have been like these fair men 
 but , laughing gaily , on they galloped fast 
 and i ran after them to be like them 
 and join the glittering host and see the world 
 but though i ran , they faded from my sight 
 yet have i followed , over hill and dale 
 day after day i follow on their track 
 and here i am as now you see me here 
 my bow has done me service on the way 
 against wild beasts and savage seeming men 

to day , all day , i rode upon the down 
 with hounds and horsemen , a brave company 
 on this side in its glory lay the sea 
 on that the sussex weald , a sea of brown 
 the wind was light , and brightly the sun shone 
 and still we galloped on from gorse to gorse 
 and once , when checked , a thrush sang , and my horse 
 pricked his quick ears as to a sound unknown 
 i knew the spring was come . i knew it even 
 better than all by this , that through my chase 
 in bush and stone and hill and sea and heaven 
 i seemed to see and follow still your face 
 your face my quarry was . for it i rode 
 my horse a thing of wings , myself a god 

farewell , my best beloved ! whose heavenly mind 
 genius with virtue , strength with softness join 'd 
 devotion , undebased by pride or art 
 with meek simplicity , and joy of heart 
 though sprightly , gentle ; though polite , sincere 
 and only of thyself a judge severe 
 unblamed , unequall 'd in each sphere of life 
 the tenderest daughter , sister , parent , wife 
 in thee , their patroness the afflicted lost 
 thy friends their pattern , ornament , and boast 
 and i — but ah , can words my loss declare 
 or paint the extremes of transport and despair 
 o thou , beyond what verse or speech can tell 
 my guide , my friend , my best beloved , farewell 

these words the poet heard in paradise 
 uttered by one who , bravely dying here 
 in the true faith was living in that sphere 
 where the celestial cross of sacrifice 
 spread its protecting arms athwart the skies 
 and set thereon , like jewels crystal clear 
 the souls magnanimous , that knew not fear 
 flashed their effulgence on his dazzled eyes 
 ah me ! how dark the discipline of pain 
 were not the suffering followed by the sense 
 of infinite rest and infinite release 
 this is our consolation ; and again 
 a great soul cries to us in our suspense 
 “ i came from martyrdom unto this peace 

and zeno paled , but joss with laugh exclaimed 
 “ why , all these good black men so grandly named 
 are only nests for mice . by jove , although 
 they lifelike look and terrible , we know 
 what is within ; just listen , and you 'll hear 
 the vermins ’ gnawing teeth , yet ‘ twould appear 
 these figures once were proudly named otho 
 and ottocar , and bela , and plato 
 alas ! the end 's not pleasant — puts one out 
 to have been kings and dukes — made mighty rout 
 colossal heroes filling tombs with slain 
 and , madame , this to only now remain 
 a peaceful nibbling rat to calmly pierce 
 a prince 's noble armor proud and fierce 

within a thick and spreading hawthorn bush 
 that overhung a molehill large and round 
 i heard from morn to morn a merry thrush 
 sing hymns to sunrise , and i drank the sound 
 with joy ; and , often an intruding guest 
 i watched her secret toils from day to day 
 how true she warped the moss , to form a nest 
 and modelled it within with wood and clay 
 and by and by , like heath bells gilt with dew 
 there lay her shining eggs , as bright as flowers 
 ink spotted over shells of greeny blue 
 and there i witnessed in the sunny hours 
 a brood of nature 's minstrels chirp and fly 
 glad as that sunshine and the laughing sky 

unnumber 'd ailes connect unnumber 'd halls 
 and sacred symbols crowd the pictur 'd walls 
 with pencil rude forgotten days design 
 and arts , or empires , live in every line 
 while chain 'd reluctant on the marble ground 
 indignant time reclines , by sculpture bound 
 and sternly bending o'er a scroll unroll 'd 
 inscribes the future with his style of gold 
 — so erst , when proteus on the briny shore 
 new forms assum 'd of eagle , pard , or boar 
 the wise atrides bound in sea weed thongs 
 the changeful god amid his scaly throngs 
 till in deep tones his opening lips at last 
 reluctant told the future and the past 

the combat ceased , the thunder birds had won 
 the water demon with one favorite son 
 fled from the carnage and escaped our wrath 
 the vapors , thinly curling from the shore 
 faint musky odors to our nostrils bore 
 the air was stilled , the silence of the dead 
 the sun , just starting on his downward path 
 a rosy mantle o'er the prairie shed 
 save where , like vultures , ominous and still 
 we clustered close , on sullen wings outspread 
 and sometimes , with a momentary chill 
 a giant shadow swept o'er plain and hill 
 a thunder bird careering overhead 
 seeking the track by which the foe had fled 

one gazed steadfast into the dying west 
 with lips apart to greet the evening star 
 and one with eyes that caught the strife and jar 
 of the sea 's heart , followed the sunward breast 
 of a lone gull ; from a slow harp one drew 
 blind music like a laugh or like a wail 
 and in the uncertain shadow of the sail 
 one wove a crown of berries and of yew 
 yet even as i said with dull desire 
 “ all these were mine , and one was mine indeed 
 the smoky music burst into a fire 
 and i was left alone in my great need 
 one foot upon the thin horn of my lyre 
 and all its strings crushed in the dripping weed 

this door you might not open , and you did 
 so enter now , and see for what slight thing 
 you are betrayed . . . . here is no treasure hid 
 no cauldron , no clear crystal mirroring 
 the sought for truth , no heads of women slain 
 for greed like yours , no writhings of distress 
 but only what you see . . . . look yet again 
 an empty room , cobwebbed and comfortless 
 yet this alone out of my life i kept 
 unto myself , lest any know me quite 
 and you did so profane me when you crept 
 unto the threshold of this room to night 
 that i must never more behold your face 
 this now is yours . i seek another place 

so i once thought ! oh , once my very soul 
 was filled and thrilled with dreaming of that role 
 life seemed so wonderful ; it held for me 
 no purpose , no ambition , but to be 
 loving and loved . my highest thought of fame 
 was some day bearing my dear lover 's name 
 alone , i ofttimes uttered it aloud 
 or wrote it down , half timid , and all proud 
 to see myself lost utterly in him 
 as some small star might joy in growing dim 
 when sinking in the sun ; or as the dew 
 forgetting the brief little life it knew 
 in space , might on the ocean 's bosom fall 
 and ask for nothing — only to give all 

on other shores , above their mouldering towns 
 in sullen pomp the tall cathedral frowns 
 pride in its aisles and paupers at the door 
 which feeds the beggars whom it fleeced of yore 
 simple and frail , our lowly temples throw 
 their slender shadows on the paths below 
 scarce steal the winds , that sweep his woodland tracks 
 the larch 's perfume from the settler 's axe 
 ere , like a vision of the morning air 
 his slight — framed steeple marks the house of prayer 
 its planks all reeking and its paint undried 
 its rafters sprouting on the shady side 
 it sheds the raindrops from its shingled eaves 
 ere its green brothers once have changed their leaves 

then hate me when thou wilt , if ever , now 
 now while the world is bent my deeds to cross 
 join with the spite of fortune , make me bow 
 and do not drop in for an after loss 
 ah do not , when my heart hath ‘ scaped this sorrow 
 come in the rearward of a conquered woe 
 give not a windy night a rainy morrow 
 to linger out a purposed overthrow 
 if thou wilt leave me , do not leave me last 
 when other petty griefs have done their spite 
 but in the onset come , so shall i taste 
 at first the very worst of fortune 's might 
 and other strains of woe , which now seem woe 
 compared with loss of thee , will not seem so 

“ o king ! to mercy be thy soul inclined 
 and spare the poet 's ever gentle kind 
 a deed like this thy future fame would wrong 
 for dear to gods and men is sacred song 
 self taught i sing ; by heaven , and heaven alone 
 the genuine seeds of poesy are sown 
 and ( what the gods bestow ) the lofty lay 
 to gods alone and godlike worth we pay 
 save then the poet , and thyself reward 
 ‘ tis thine to merit , mine is to record 
 that here i sung , was force , and not desire 
 this hand reluctant touch 'd the warbling wire 
 and let thy son attest , nor sordid pay 
 nor servile flattery , stain 'd the moral lay 

the knell of whitehead tolls !— his cares are past 
 the hapless tribute of his purchas 'd lays 
 his servile , his egyptian tasks of praise 
 if not sublime his strains , fame justly plac 'd 
 their power above their work .— now , with wide gaze 
 of much indignant wonder , she surveys 
 to the life labouring oar assiduous haste 
 a glowing bard , by every muse embrac 'd 
 o , warton ! chosen priest of ph œ bus ’ choir 
 shall thy rapt song be venal ? hymn the throne 
 whether its edicts just applause inspire 
 or patriot virtue view them with a frown 
 what needs for this the golden stringed lyre 
 the snowy tunic , and the sun bright zone 

between us leapt a gold and scarlet flame 
 into the hollow of the cupped , arched blue 
 of heaven it rose . its flickering tongues up drew 
 and vanished in the sunshine . how it came 
 we guessed not , nor what thing could be its name 
 from each to each had sprung those sparks which flew 
 together into fire . but we knew 
 the winds would slap and quench it in their game 
 and so we graved and fashioned marble blocks 
 to treasure it , and placed them round about 
 with pillared porticos we wreathed the whole 
 and roofed it with bright bronze . behind carved locks 
 flowered the tall and sheltered flame . without 
 the baffled winds thrust at a column 's bole 

“ we people that work , ” said the bee with a jerk 
 “ find a benefit sometimes in stopping 
 only insects like you , who have nothing to do 
 can keep perpetually hopping 
 the grasshopper paused on his way 
 and thoughtfully hunched up his knees 
 “ why trouble this sunshiny day 
 quoth he , “ with reflections like these 
 i follow the trade for which i was made 
 we all can n't be wise bumble bees 
 there 's a time to be sad and a time to be glad 
 a time for both working and stopping 
 for men to make money , for you to make honey 
 and for me to keep constantly hopping 

the sirens once were maidens innocent 
 that through the water meads with proserpine 
 plucked no fire hearted flowers , but were content 
 cool fritillaries and flag flowers to twine 
 with lilies woven and with wet woodbine 
 till once they sought the bright aetnaean flowers 
 and their glad mistress fled from summer hours 
 with hades , far from olive , corn , and vine 
 and they have sought her all the wide world through 
 till many years , and wisdom , and much wrong 
 have filled and changed their song , and o'er the blue 
 rings deadly sweet the magic of the song 
 and whoso hears must listen till he die 
 far on the flowery shores of sicily 

the husband , while the holy pastor spoke 
 appeared to grumble and his stars invoke 
 the wife was in a rage , and ‘ gan to scold 
 said she to peter , wretch that i behold 
 thou'lt be through life a prey to pain and grief 
 come not to me and bray and hope relief 
 the worthy pastor would have us procured 
 the means that might much comfort have ensured 
 can he deserve such treatment to receive 
 good mister john this goose i now would leave 
 and ev'ry morning , while he gathers fruits 
 or plants , herbs , cabbages , and various roots 
 without averting him , pray , here repair

the little love god lying once asleep 
 laid by his side his heart inflaming brand 
 whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep 
 came tripping by , but in her maiden hand 
 the fairest votary took up that fire 
 which many legions of true hearts had warmed 
 and so the general of hot desire 
 was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed 
 this brand she quenched in a cool well by 
 which from love 's fire took heat perpetual 
 growing a bath and healthful remedy 
 for men discased , but i my mistress ’ thrall 
 came there for cure and this by that i prove 
 love 's fire heats water , water cools not love 

the hostess whispered him she thought her spouse 
 again , my dear , such sparks let 's never house 
 pray do n't you hear how they together chat 
 just then the husband raised himself and sat 
 is this your plan ? said he with mighty rage 
 was it for this you would my house engage 
 you understand me , but i 'll seek redress 
 think you so very cheap to have success 
 what , would you ruin families at will 
 and with our daughters take at ease your fill 
 away , i say ! my house this moment quit 
 and as for you , abominable chit 
 i 'll have your life : this hour you breathe your last 
 such creatures only can with beasts be classed 

man was not made for forms , but forms for man 
 and there are times when law itself must bend 
 to that clear spirit always in the van 
 outspeeding human justice . in the end 
 potentates , not humanity , must fall 
 water will find its level , fire will burn 
 the winds must blow around the earthly ball 
 the earthly ball by day and night must turn 
 freedom is typed in every element 
 man must be free , if not through law , why then 
 above the law , until its force be spent 
 and justice brings a better . but , o , when 
 father of light , when shall the reckoning come 
 to lift the weak , and strike the oppressor dumb 

he eats ( a moment 's stoppage to his song 
 the stolen turnip as he goes along 
 and hops along and heeds with careless eye 
 the passing crowded stage coach reeling bye 
 he talks to none but wends his silent way 
 and finds a hovel at the close of day 
 or under any hedge his house is made 
 he has no calling and he owns no trade 
 an old smoaked blanket arches oer his head 
 a whisp of straw or stubble makes his bed 
 he knows a lawless law that claims no kin 
 but meet and plunder on and feel no sin 
 no matter where they go or where they dwell 
 they dally with the winds and laugh at hell 

all curses be about her , and all ill 
 go with her ; heaven be dark above her way 
 the gulf beneath her glad and sure of prey 
 and , wheresoe'er her prow be pointed , still 
 the winds of heaven have all one evil will 
 conspirant even as hearts of kings to slay 
 with mouths of kings to lie and smile and pray 
 and chiefliest his whose wintrier breath makes chill 
 with more than winter 's and more poisonous cold 
 the horror of his kingdom toward the north 
 the deserts of his kingdom toward the east 
 and though death hide not in her direful hold 
 be all stars adverse toward her that come forth 
 nightly , by day all hours till all have ceased 

i scarcely grieve , o nature ! at the lot 
 that pent my life within a city 's bounds 
 and shut me from thy sweetest sights and sounds 
 perhaps i had not learned , if some lone cot 
 had nursed a dreamy childhood , what the mart 
 taught me amid its turmoil ; so my youth 
 had missed full many a stern but wholesome truth 
 here , too , o nature ! in this haunt of art 
 thy power is on me , and i own thy thrall 
 there is no unimpressive spot on earth 
 the beauty of the stars is over all 
 and day and darkness visit every hearth 
 clouds do not scorn us : yonder factory 's smoke 
 looked like a golden mist when morning broke 

judge not too idly that our toils are mean 
 though no new levies marshal on our green 
 nor deem too rashly that our gains are small 
 weighed with the prizes for which heroes fall 
 see , where thick vapor wreathes the battle line 
 there mercy follows with her oil and wine 
 or where brown labor with its peaceful charm 
 stiffens the sinews of the nation 's arm 
 what nerves its hands to strike a deadlier blow 
 and hurl its legions on the rebel foe 
 lo ! for each town new rising o'er our state 
 see the foe 's hamlet waste and desolate 
 while each new factory lifts its chimney tall 
 like a fresh mortar trained on richmond 's wall 

beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan 
 for that deep wound it gives my friend and me 
 is't not enough to torture me alone 
 but slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be 
 me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken 
 and my next self thou harder hast engrossed 
 of him , my self , and thee i am forsaken 
 a torment thrice three fold thus to be crossed 
 prison my heart in thy steel bosom 's ward 
 but then my friend 's heart let my poor heart bail 
 whoe'er keeps me , let my heart be his guard 
 thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol 
 and yet thou wilt , for i being pent in thee 
 perforce am thine and all that is in me 

and is not earth thy living picture , where 
 thou utterest beauty , simple and profound 
 in the same form by wondrous union bound 
 where one may see the first step of the stair 
 and not the next , for brooding vapours there 
 and god is well content the starry round 
 should wake the infant 's inarticulate sound 
 or lofty song from bursting heart of prayer 
 and so all men of low or lofty mind 
 who in their hearts hear thy unspoken word 
 have lessons low or lofty , to their kind 
 in these thy living shows of beauty , lord 
 while the child 's heart that simply childlike is 
 knows that the father 's face looks full in his 

“ this circuit , ” said my teacher , “ knots the scourge 
 for envy , and the cords are therefore drawn 
 by charity 's correcting hand . the curb 
 is of a harsher sound , as thou shalt hear 
 ( if i deem rightly ) , ere thou reach the pass 
 where pardon sets them free . but fix thine eyes 
 intently through the air , and thou shalt see 
 a multitude before thee seated , each 
 along the shelving grot . ” then more than erst 
 i op 'd my eyes , before me view 'd , and saw 
 shadows with garments dark as was the rock 
 and when we pass 'd a little forth , i heard 
 a crying , “ blessed mary ! pray for us 
 michael and peter ! all ye saintly host 

beloved , thou hast brought me many flowers 
 plucked in the garden , all the summer through 
 and winter , and it seemed as if they grew 
 in this close room , nor missed the sun and showers 
 so , in the like name of that love of ours 
 take back these thoughts which here unfolded too 
 and which on warm and cold days i withdrew 
 from my heart 's ground . indeed , those beds and bowers 
 be overgrown with bitter weeds and rue 
 and wait thy weeding ; yet here 's eglantine 
 here 's ivy !— take them , as i used to do 
 thy flowers , and keep them where they shall not pine 
 instruct thine eyes to keep their colours true 
 and tell thy soul , their roots are left in mine 

o ! it is pleasant , with a heart at ease 
 just after sunset , or by moonlight skies 
 to make the shifting clouds be what you please 
 or let the easily persuaded eyes 
 own each quaint likeness issuing from the mould 
 of a friend 's fancy ; or with head bent low 
 and cheek aslant see rivers flow of gold 
 ‘ twixt crimson banks ; and then , a traveller , go 
 from mount to mount through cloudland , gorgeous land 
 or list'ning to the tide , with closed sight 
 be that blind bard , who on the chian strand 
 by those deep sounds possessed with inward light 
 beheld the iliad and the odyssee 
 rise to the swelling of the voiceful sea 

oft do i marvel whether delia 's eyes 
 are eyes , or else two radiant stars that shine 
 for how could nature ever thus devise 
 of earth , on earth , a substance so divine 
 stars , sure , they are , whose motions rule desires 
 and calm and tempest follow their aspects 
 their sweet appearing still such power inspires 
 that makes the world admire so strange effects 
 yet whether fixed or wandering stars are they 
 whose influence rules the orb of my poor heart 
 fixed , sure , they are , but wandering make me stray 
 in endless errors whence i cannot part 
 stars , then , not eyes , move you with milder view 
 your sweet aspect on him that honours you 

at length the awful revelation came 
 crushing at once his pride of birth and name 
 the hopes his yearning bosom forward cast 
 and the ancestral glories of the vast 
 all fell together , crumbling in disgrace 
 a turret rent from battlement to base 
 his daughters talking in the dead of night 
 in their own chamber , and without a light 
 listening , as he was wont , he overheard 
 and learned the dreadful secret , word by word 
 and hurrying from his castle , with a cry 
 he raised his hands to the unpitying sky 
 repeating one dread word , till bush and tree 
 caught it , and shuddering answered , “ heresy 

i think i should have loved you presently 
 and given in earnest words i flung in jest 
 and lifted honest eyes for you to see 
 and caught your hand against my cheek and breast 
 and all my pretty follies flung aside 
 that won you to me , and beneath your gaze 
 naked of reticence and shorn of pride 
 spread like a chart my little wicked ways 
 i , that had been to you , had you remained 
 but one more waking from a recurrent dream 
 cherish no less the certain stakes i gained 
 and walk your memory 's halls , austere , supreme 
 a ghost in marble of a girl you knew 
 who would have loved you in a day or two 

o wholesome death , thy sombre funeral car 
 looms ever dimly on the lengthening way 
 of life ; while , lengthening still , in sad array 
 my deeds in long procession go , that are 
 as mourners of the man they helped to mar 
 i see it all in dreams , such as waylay 
 the wandering fancy when the solid day 
 has fallen in smoldering ruins , and night 's star 
 aloft there , with its steady point of light 
 mastering the eye , has wrapped the brain in sleep 
 ah , when i die , and planets take their flight 
 above my grave , still let my spirit keep 
 sometimes its vigil of divine remorse 
 ‘ midst pity , praise , or blame heaped o'er my corse 

if thou must love me , let it be for nought 
 except for love 's sake only . do not say 
 “ i love her for her smile — her look — her way 
 of speaking gently ,— for a trick of thought 
 that falls in well with mine , and certes brought 
 a sense of pleasant ease on such a day 
 for these things in themselves , beloved , may 
 be changed , or change for thee ,— and love , so wrought 
 may be unwrought so . neither love me for 
 thine own dear pity 's wiping my cheeks dry 
 a creature might forget to weep , who bore 
 thy comfort long , and lose thy love thereby 
 but love me for love 's sake , that evermore 
 thou may'st love on , through love 's eternity 

i could not think of thee as piec è d rot 
 yet such thou wert , for thou hadst been long dead 
 yet thou liv ’ dst entire in my seeing thought 
 and what thou wert in me had never fled 
 nay , i had fixed the moments of thy beauty 
 thy ebbing smile , thy kiss ’ s readiness 
 and memory had taught my heart the duty 
 to know thee ever at that deathlessness 
 but when i came where thou wert laid , and saw 
 the natural flowers ignoring thee sans blame 
 and the encroaching grass , with casual flaw 
 framing the stone to age where was thy name 
 i knew not how to feel , nor what to be 
 towards thy fate ’ s material secrecy 

there hung a calm and solemn sunshine round 
 those mighty monuments , a hushing sound 
 in the still air that circled them which stole 
 like music of past times into my soul 
 i thought what myriads of the wise and brave 
 and beautiful had sunk into the grave 
 since earth first saw these wonders — and i said 
 “ are things eternal only for the dead 
 “ hath man no loftier hope than this which dooms 
 “ his only lasting trophies to be tombs 
 “ but ‘ tis not so — earth , heaven , all nature shows 
 “ he may become immortal — may unclose 
 “ the wings within him wrapt , and proudly rise 
 “ redeemed from earth , a creature of the skies 

“ as ever on this side the boiling wave 
 thou seest diminishing , ” the centaur said 
 “ so on the other , be thou well assur 'd 
 it lower still and lower sinks its bed 
 till in that part it reuniting join 
 where ‘ t is the lot of tyranny to mourn 
 there heav'n ' s stern justice lays chastising hand 
 on attila , who was the scourge of earth 
 on sextus , and on pyrrhus , and extracts 
 tears ever by the seething flood unlock 'd 
 from the rinieri , of corneto this 
 pazzo the other nam 'd , who fill 'd the ways 
 with violence and war . ” this said , he turn 'd 
 and quitting us , alone repass 'd the ford 

the sex inclined to follow this advice 
 about receipts however they were not nice 
 the entertainment greatly was admired 
 and pure devotion all their bosoms fired 
 a glass of cordial some apart received 
 good cheer was given , may be well believed 
 ten youthful dames brisk friar fripart took 
 gay , airy , and engaging ev'ry look 
 who paid with pleasure all the monk could wish 
 some had fifteen :— some twelve to taste their dish 
 good friar rock had twenty for his share 
 and gave such satisfaction to the fair 
 that some , to show they never grudged the price 
 and proved their punctuality ,— paid twice 

one looks into the sun lawn , and the steep 
 curved slopes of hills , set sharp against the sky 
 with tufted woods encinctured , waving high 
 o'er vales below , where broken shadows sleep 
 here , looking forth before the first faint cry 
 of mother bird , fluttering a drowsy wing 
 above her brood , awakes the full voiced choir 
 ere yet the morning tips the hills with fire 
 and turns the drapery of the east to gold 
 my wondering eyes the opening heavens behold 
 where far within deep calleth unto deep 
 and the whole world stands hushed and worshipping 
 even thus ,— i muse ,— shall heaven 's gates unfold 
 when earth beholds the coming of her king 

the frugal snail , with forecast of repose 
 carries his house with him where'er he goes 
 peeps out ,— and if there comes a shower of rain 
 retreats to his small domicile amain 
 touch but a tip of him , a horn ,— ‘ tis well 
 he curls up in his sanctuary shell 
 he 's his own landlord , his own tenant ; stay 
 long as he will , he dreads no quarter day 
 himself he boards and lodges ; both invites 
 and feasts himself ; sleeps with himself o ’ nights 
 he spares the upholsterer trouble to procure 
 chattels ; himself is his own furniture 
 and his sole riches . whereso'er he roam 
 knock when you will ,— he 's sure to be at home 

if , aged charon , when my life shall end 
 i pass thy ferry and my waftage pay 
 thy oars shall fall , thy boat and mast shall rend 
 and through the deep shall be a dry foot way 
 for why ? my heart with sighs doth breathe such flame 
 that air and water both incens è d be 
 the boundless ocean from whose mouth they came 
 for from my heat not heaven itself is free 
 then since to me thy loss can be no gain 
 avoid thy harm and fly what i foretell 
 make thou thy love with me for to be slain 
 that i with her and both with thee may dwell 
 thy fact thus , charon , both of us shall bless 
 thou save thy boat and i my love possess 

the first created held a joyous bower 
 a flowering field , the world 's sole wonderment 
 high paradise , from whence a woman 's power 
 enticed him to fall to endless banishment 
 this on the banks of euphrates did stand 
 till the first mover , by his wondrous might 
 planted it in thine eyes , thy face , thy hands 
 from whence the world receives his fairest light 
 thy cheeks contain choice flowers ; thy eyes , two suns 
 thy hands , the fruit that no life blood can stain 
 and in thy breath , that heavenly music wons 
 which , when thou speak'st , angels their voices strain 
 as from the first thy sex exil è d me 
 so to this next let me be called by thee 

as the lone , frighted user of a night road 
 suddenly turns round , nothing to detect 
 yet on his fear ’ s sense keepeth still the load 
 of that brink nothing he doth but suspect 
 and the cold terror moves to him more near 
 of something that from nothing casts a spell 
 that , when he moves , to fright more is not there 
 and ’ s only visible when invisible 
 so i upon the world turn round in thought 
 and nothing viewing do no courage take 
 but my more terror , from no seen cause got 
 to that felt corporate emptiness forsake 
 and draw my sense of mystery ’ s horror from 
 seeing no mystery ’ s mystery alone 

the darkness in the loft is sweet and warm 
 with the stored hay ... darkness intensified 
 by one bright shaft that enters through the wide 
 tall doors from under fringes of a storm 
 which makes the doomed sun brighter . on the hay 
 perched mountain high they sit , and silently 
 watch the motes dance and look at the dark sky 
 and mark how heartbreakingly far away 
 and yet how close and clear the distance seems 
 while all at hand is cloud — brightness of dreams 
 unrealisable , yet seen so clear 
 so only just beyond the dark . they wait 
 scarce knowing what they wait for , half in fear 
 expectance draws the curtain from their fate 

and through the long , still nights this cry was hers 
 as on her couch she lay till dreary dawn 
 her large eyes dark with horror looking out 
 upon the pitchy darkness unafraid 
 and as the breathings of the new spring breeze 
 soft sights of sad complaint , to autumn 's storms 
 that hold the burdened sorrow of a year 
 was this , her sigh of , “ oh , the happy world 
 to this despairing cry of , “ oh , my heart 
 and as the year 's late winds leave pale and chill 
 the earth , so did this weary cry of hers 
 so oft repeated leave her lips like snow 
 and oft the lonely midnight heard her moan 
 of hopes foregone , that women hold most dear 

to whom gerenian nestor thus replied 
 “ such are indeed our prospects ; jove on high 
 could to our fortunes give no diff'rent turn 
 the wall is raz 'd , wherein our trust we plac 'd 
 to guard , impregnable , ourselves and ships 
 and now around the ships their war they wage 
 unceasing , unabated ; none might tell 
 by closest scrutiny , which way are driv'n 
 the routed greeks , so intermix 'd they fall 
 promiscuous ; and the cry ascends to heav'n 
 but come , discuss we what may best be done 
 if judgment aught may profit us ; ourselves 
 to mingle in the fray i counsel not 
 it were not well for wounded men to fight 

time , the old humourist , has a trick to day 
 of moving landmarks and of levelling down 
 till into town the suburbs edge their way 
 and in the suburbs you may scent the town 
 with mount st. thus approaching muswell hill 
 and clapham common marching with the mile 
 you get a hammersmith that fills the bill 
 a hampstead with a serious sense of style 
 so this fair creature , pictured in the row 
 as one of that ‘ gay adulterous world , ’ { 79 } whose round 
 is by the serpentine , as well would show 
 and might , i deem , as readily be found 
 on streatham 's hill , or wimbledon 's , or where 
 brixtonian kitchens lard the late dining air 

then , too , the scenes of pomp and joy that make 
 one theatre of this vast peopled lake 
 where all that love , religion , commerce gives 
 of life and motion , ever moves and lives 
 here , up in the steps of temples , from the wave 
 ascending , in procession slow and grave 
 priests in white garments go , with sacred wands 
 and silver cymbals gleaming in their hands 
 while there , rich barks — fresh from those sunny tracts 
 far off , beyond the sounding cataracts 
 glide with their precious lading to the sea 
 plumes of bright birds , rhinoceros ’ ivory 
 gems from the isle of mero ë, and those grains 
 of gold , washed down by abyssinian rains 

thus labour 'd they amid the stubborn fight 
 but of tydides none might say to whom 
 his arm belong 'd , or whether with the hosts 
 of troy or greece he mingled in the fight 
 hither and thither o'er the plain he rush 'd 
 like to a wintry stream , that brimming o'er 
 breaks down its barriers in its rapid course 
 nor well built bridge can stem the flood , nor fence 
 guards the fertile fields , as down it pours 
 its sudden torrent , swoll'n with rain from heav'n 
 and many a goodly work of man destroys 
 so back were borne before tydides ’ might 
 the serried ranks of troy , nor dar 'd await 
 despite their numbers , his impetuous charge 

i raised her tenderly with pitying arms 
 and in a garden , far from life 's alarms 
 i buried her , and left her all alone 
 and wrote this epitaph upon the stone 
 “ peace to her ashes , but not peace to those 
 her erewhile friends , the cause of all her woes 
 who fondled and caressed her for a space 
 who loved to stroke her soft , confiding face 
 who gave her food and shelter from her birth 
 who joined in all her harmless youthful mirth 
 but , when they went for holidays to roam 
 shut to the door of what had been her home 
 and thoughtless left to die upon the mat 
 their faithful but forgotten tabby cat 

thus live undying through the lapse of time 
 the solemn legends of the warrior 's clime 
 like egypt 's pyramid or paestum 's fane 
 they stand the heralds of the voiceless plain 
 yet not like them , for time , by slow degrees 
 saps the gray stone and wears the embroidered frieze 
 and isis sleeps beneath her subject nile 
 and crumbled neptune strews his dorian pile 
 but art 's fair fabric , strengthening as it rears 
 its laurelled columns through the mist of years 
 as the blue arches of the bending skies 
 still gird the torrent , following as it flies 
 spreads , with the surges bearing on mankind 
 its starred pavilion o'er the tides of mind 

so greatly gave he , nurturing ‘ gainst the call 
 of one rare moment all the daily store 
 of joy distilled from the acquitted task 
 and that deliberate rashness which bespeaks 
 the pondered action passed into the blood 
 so swift to harden purpose into deed 
 that , with the wind of ruin in his hair 
 soul sprang full statured from the broken flesh 
 and at one stroke he lived the whole of life 
 poured all in one libation to the truth 
 a brimming flood whose drops shall overflow 
 on deserts of the soul long beaten down 
 by the brute hoof of habit , till they spring 
 in manifold upheaval to the sun 

the face of all the world is changed , i think 
 since first i heard the footsteps of thy soul 
 move still , oh , still , beside me , as they stole 
 betwixt me and the dreadful outer brink 
 of obvious death , where i , who thought to sink 
 was caught up into love , and taught the whole 
 of life in a new rhythm . the cup of dole 
 god gave for baptism , i am fain to drink 
 and praise its sweetness , sweet , with thee anear 
 the names of country , heaven , are changed away 
 for where thou art or shalt be , there or here 
 and this . . . this lute and song . . . loved yesterday 
 ( the singing angels know ) are only dear 
 because thy name moves right in what they say 

my love , and not i , is the egoist 
 my love for thee loves itself more than thee 
 ay , more than me , in whom it doth exist 
 and makes me live that it may feed on me 
 in the country of bridges the bridge is 
 more real than the shores it doth unsever 
 so in our world , all of relation , this 
 is true — that truer is love than either lover 
 this thought therefore comes lightly to doubt ’ s door 
 if we , seeing substance of this world , are not 
 mere intervals , god ’ s absence and no more 
 hollows in real consciousness and thought 
 and if ’ tis possible to thought to bear this fruit 
 why should it not be possible to truth 

because i oft in dark abstracted guise 
 seem most alone in greatest company 
 with dearth of words , or answers quite awry 
 to them that would make speech of speech arise 
 they deem , and of their doom the rumour flies 
 that poison foul of bubbling pride doth lie 
 so in my swelling breast , that only i 
 fawn on myself , and others do despise 
 yet pride , i think , doth not my soul possess 
 which looks too oft in his unflattering glass 
 but one worse fault , ambition , i confess 
 that makes me oft my best friends overpass 
 unseen , unheard , while thought to highest place 
 bends all his powers , even unto stella 's grace 

we feel and see with different hearts and eyes 
 ah christ , if all our hearts could meet in thee 
 how well it were for them and well for me 
 our hearts thy dear accepted sacrifice 
 thou , only life of hearts and light of eyes 
 our life , our light , if once we turn to thee 
 so be it , o lord , to them and so to me 
 be all alike thine own dear sacrifice 
 thou who by death hast ransomed us from death 
 thyself god 's sole well pleasing sacrifice 
 thine only sacred self i plead with thee 
 make thou it well for them and well for me 
 that thou hast given us souls and wills and breath 
 and hearts to love thee ; and to see thee , eyes 

“ next by sensation led , new joys commence 
 from the fine movements of the excited sense 
 in swarms ideal urge their airy flight 
 adorn the day scenes , and illume the night 
 her spells o'er all the hand of fancy flings 
 gives form and substance to unreal things 
 with fruits and foliage decks the barren waste 
 and brightens life with sentiment and taste 
 pleased o'er the level and the rule presides 
 the painter 's brush , the sculptor 's chisel guides 
 with ray ethereal lights the poet 's fire 
 tunes the rude pipe , or strings the heroic lyre 
 charm 'd round the nymph on frolic footsteps move 
 the angelic forms of beauty , grace , and love 

despairless ! hopeless ! quietly i wait 
 on these unpeopled tracks the happy close 
 of day , whose advent rang with noise elate 
 whose later stage was quick with mirthful shows 
 and clasping loves , with hate and hearty blows 
 and dreams of coming gifts withheld by fate 
 from morrow unto morrow , till her great 
 dread eyes ‘ gan tell of other gifts than those 
 and her advancing wings gloomed like a pall 
 her speech foretelling joy became a dirge 
 as piteous as pitiless ; and all 
 my company had passed beyond the verge 
 and lost me ere fate raised her blinding wings 
 hark ! through the dusk a bird “ at heaven 's gate sings 

“ not without purpose once more to return 
 thou find'st me , my casella , where i am 
 journeying this way ; ” i said , “ but how of thee 
 hath so much time been lost ? ” he answer 'd straight 
 “ no outrage hath been done to me , if he 
 who when and whom he chooses takes , me oft 
 this passage hath denied , since of just will 
 his will he makes . these three months past indeed 
 he , whose chose to enter , with free leave 
 hath taken ; whence i wand'ring by the shore 
 where tyber 's wave grows salt , of him gain 'd kind 
 admittance , at that river 's mouth , tow'rd which 
 his wings are pointed , for there always throng 
 all such as not to archeron descend 

of whist or cribbage mark th ’ amusing game 
 the partners changing , but the sport the same 
 else would the gamester 's anxious ardour cool 
 dull every deal , and stagnant every pool 
 — yet must one man , with one unceasing wife 
 play the long rubber of connubial life 
 yes ! human laws , and laws esteemed divine 
 the generous passion straighten and confine 
 and , as a stream , when art constrains its course 
 pours its fierce torrent with augmented force 
 so passion , narrowed to one channel small 
 unlike the former ,— does not flow at all 
 for love then only flaps his purple wings 
 when uncontrolled by priestcraft or by kings 

if i by gods , by heroes and by men 
 be re assured , so that i not despair 
 nor fear , pain , nor the impediments 
 of death of body , joy and happiness 
 yet must i learn to suffer and to feel 
 and that i may my pathways clearly see 
 let doubts arise , and dolour , and the woe 
 of vanished hopes , of joy and all delight 
 but if he should behold , should grant , and should attend 
 my thoughts , my wishes , and my reasoning 
 who makes them so uncertain , hot , and vague 
 such dear conceits , such acts and speech 
 will not be given nor done to him , who stays 
 from birth , through life , to death in sheltered home 

i cannot syllable that unworded praise 
 an ashen sapling bending in thy wind 
 uplifting in thy light new budded leaves 
 nor for myself nor any other raise 
 my boughs in music , though the woodland heaves 
 o with what ease of pain at length resigned 
 what hope to the old inheritance restored 
 thy praise it is that men at last are glad 
 long unaccustomed brightness in their eyes 
 needs must seem beautiful in thine , bright lord 
 and to forget the part that sorrow had 
 in every shadowed breast , where still it lies 
 is there not praise in such forgetfulness 
 for to grieve less means not that love is less 

o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem 
 by that sweet ornament which truth doth give 
 the rose looks fair , but fairer we it deem 
 for that sweet odour , which doth in it live 
 the canker blooms have full as deep a dye 
 as the perfumed tincture of the roses 
 hang on such thorns , and play as wantonly 
 when summer 's breath their masked buds discloses 
 but for their virtue only is their show 
 they live unwooed , and unrespected fade 
 die to themselves . sweet roses do not so 
 of their sweet deaths , are sweetest odours made 
 and so of you , beauteous and lovely youth 
 when that shall vade , by verse distills your truth 

archbishop turpin , above the rest

nay , in the first tumultuous days of youth 
 with all its joys , desires , and sufferings 
 i often called on death , and long would sit 
 by yonder fountain , longing , in its waves 
 to put an end alike to hope and grief 
 and afterwards , by lingering sickness brought 
 unto the borders of the grave , i wept 
 o'er my lost youth , the flower of my days 
 so prematurely fading ; often , too 
 at late hours sitting on my conscious bed 
 composing , by the dim light of the lamp 
 i with the silence and the night would moan 
 o'er my departing soul , and to myself 
 in languid tones would sing my funeral song 

earth has not any thing to shew more fair 
 dull would he be of soul who could pass by 
 a sight so touching in it 's majesty 
 this city now doth like a garment wear 
 the beauty of the morning ; silent , bare 
 ships , towers , domes , theatres , and temples lie 
 open unto the fields , and to the sky 
 all bright and glittering in the smokeless air 
 never did sun more beautifully steep 
 in his first splendor valley , rock , or hill 
 ne'er saw i , never felt , a calm so deep 
 the river glideth at his own sweet will 
 dear god ! the very houses seem asleep

 have forfeited their ancient english dower 
 of inward happiness . we are selfish men 
 oh ! raise us up , return to us again 
 and give us manners , virtue , freedom , power 
 thy soul was like a star and dwelt apart 
 thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea 
 pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free 
 so didst thou travel on life 's common way 
 in chearful godliness ; and yet thy heart 
 the lowliest duties on itself did lay 

there was a day when death to me meant tears 
 and tearful takings leave that had to be 
 and awed embarkings on an unshored sea 
 and sudden disarrangement of the years 
 but now i know that nothing interferes 
 with the fixed forces when a tired man dies 
 that death is only answerings and replies 
 the chiming of a bell which no one hears 
 the casual slanting of a half spent sun 
 the soft recessional of noise and coil 
 the coveted something time nor age can spoil 
 i know it is a fabric finely spun 
 between the stars and dark ; to seize and keep 
 such glad romances as we read in sleep

after the fierce midsummer all ablaze 
 has burned itself to ashes , and expires 
 in the intensity of its own fires 
 there come the mellow , mild , st. martin days 
 crowned with the calm of peace , but sad with haze 
 so after love has led us , till he tires 
 of his own throes and torments and desires 
 comes large eyed friendship : with a restful gaze 
 he beckons us to follow , and across 
 cool , verdant vales we wander free from care 
 is it a touch of frost lies in the air 
 why are we haunted with a sense of loss 
 we do not wish the pain back , or the heat 
 and yet , and yet , these days are incomplete 

they pass me by like shadows , crowds on crowds 
 dim ghosts of men , that hover to and fro 
 hugging their bodies round them like thin shrouds 
 wherein their souls were buried long ago 
 they trampled on their youth , and faith , and love 
 they cast their hope of human kind away 
 with heaven 's clear messages they madly strove 
 and conquered ,— and their spirits turned to clay 
 lo ! how they wander round the world , their grave 
 whose ever gaping maw by such is fed 
 gibbering at living men , and idly rave 
 ‘ we only truly live , but ye are dead 
 alas ! poor fools , the anointed eye may trace 
 a dead soul 's epitaph in every face

 “ yet fear not me for this , nor start asunder 
 arcadian life shall keep its ancient zest

as to a child , i talked my heart asleep 
 with empty promise of the coming day 
 and it slept rather for my words made sleep 
 than from a thought of what their sense did say 
 for did it care for sense , would it not wake 
 and question closer to the morrow ’ s pleasure 
 would it not edge nearer my words , to take 
 the promise in the meting of its measure 
 so , if it slept , ’ twas that it cared but for 
 the present sleepy use of promised joy 
 thanking the fruit but for the forecome flower 
 which the less active senses best enjoy

 of which deceit ’ s self knows itself a part

inglorious friend ! most confident i am 
 thy life is one of very little ease 
 albeit men mock thee with their similes 
 and prate of being “ happy as a clam 
 what though thy shell protects thy fragile head 
 from the sharp bailiffs of the briny sea 
 thy valves are , sure , no safety valves to thee 
 while rakes are free to desecrate thy bed 
 and bear thee off — as foemen take their spoil 
 far from thy friends and family to roam 
 forced , like a hessian , from thy native home 
 to meet destruction in a foreign broil 
 though thou art tender yet thy humble bard 
 declares , o clam ! thy case is shocking hard 

slow toiling upward from ’ the misty vale 
 i leave the bright enamelled zones below 
 no more for me their beauteous bloom shall glow 
 their lingering sweetness load the morning gale 
 few are the slender flowerets , scentless , pale 
 that on their ice clad stems all trembling blow 
 along the margin of unmelting snow 
 yet with unsaddened voice thy verge i hail 
 white realm of peace above the flowering line 
 welcome thy frozen domes , thy rocky spires 
 o'er thee undimmed the moon girt planets shine 
 on thy majestic altars fade the fires 
 that filled the air with smoke of vain desires 
 and all the unclouded blue of heaven is thine 

yet more , when fair lavinia fed the fire 
 before the gods , and stood beside her sire 
 ( strange to relate !) the flames , involv 'd in smoke 
 of incense , from the sacred altar broke 
 caught her dishevel 'd hair and rich attire 
 her crown and jewels crackled in the fire 
 from thence the fuming trail began to spread 
 and lambent glories danc 'd about her head 
 this new portent the seer with wonder views 
 then pausing , thus his prophecy renews 
 “ the nymph , who scatters flaming fires around 
 shall shine with honor , shall herself be crown 'd 
 but , caus 'd by her irrevocable fate 
 war shall the country waste , and change the state 

unchanged within , to see all changed without 
 is a blank lot and hard to bear , no doubt 
 yet why at others ’ wanings should'st thou fret 
 then only might'st thou feel a just regret 
 hadst thou withheld thy love or hid thy light 
 in selfish forethought of neglect and slight 
 o wiselier then , from feeble yearnings freed 
 while , and on whom , thou may'st — shine on ! nor heed 
 whether the object by reflected light 
 return thy radiance or absorb it quite 
 and though thou notest from thy safe recess 
 old friends burn dim , like lamps in noisome air 
 love them for what they are ; nor love them less 
 because to thee they are not what they were 

the king gazed upward at the cloudless sky 
 whispered a word , and raised his hand on high 
 and lo ! the signet ring of chrysoprase 
 on his uplifted finger seemed to blaze 
 with hidden fire , and rushing from the west 
 there came a mighty wind , and seized the guest 
 and lifted him from earth , and on they passed 
 his shining garments streaming in the blast 
 a silken banner o'er the walls upreared 
 a purple cloud , that gleamed and disappeared 
 then said the angel , smiling : “ if this man 
 be rajah runjeet sing of hindostan 
 thou hast done well in listening to his prayer 
 i was upon my way to seek him there 

already the rutulians deem their man 
 o'ermatch ' d in arms , before the fight began 
 first rising fears are whisper 'd thro ’ the crowd 
 then , gath'ring sound , they murmur more aloud 
 now , side to side , they measure with their eyes 
 the champions ’ bulk , their sinews , and their size 
 the nearer they approach , the more is known 
 th ’ apparent disadvantage of their own 
 turnus himself appears in public sight 
 conscious of fate , desponding of the fight 
 slowly he moves , and at his altar stands 
 with eyes dejected , and with trembling hands 
 and , while he mutters undistinguish 'd pray'rs 
 a livid deadness in his cheeks appears 

frown ever opposite , the angel cried 
 who , with an earthquake 's might and giant hand 
 severed these riven rocks , and bade them stand 
 severed for ever ! the vast ocean tide 
 leaving its roar without at his command 
 shrank , and beneath the woods through the green land 
 went gently murmuring on , so to deride 
 the frowning barriers that its force defied 
 but art , high o'er the trailing smoke below 
 of sea bound steamer , on yon summit 's head 
 sat musing ; and where scarce a wandering crow 
 sailed o'er the chasm , in thought a highway led 
 conquering , as by an arrow from a bow 
 the scene 's lone genius by her elfin thread 

the kind instructor in these words began 
 “ ere farther thou proceed , know thou art now 
 i ’ th ’ second round , and shalt be , till thou come 
 upon the horrid sand : look therefore well 
 around thee , and such things thou shalt behold 
 as would my speech discredit . ” on all sides 
 i heard sad plainings breathe , and none could see 
 from whom they might have issu 'd . in amaze 
 fast bound i stood . he , as it seem 'd , believ 'd 
 that i had thought so many voices came 
 from some amid those thickets close conceal 'd 
 and thus his speech resum 'd : “ if thou lop off 
 a single twig from one of those ill plants 
 the thought thou hast conceiv 'd shall vanish quite 

low , low down in the violets i press 
 my lips and whisper to her . does she hear 
 and yet hold silence , though i call her dear 
 just as of old , save for the tearfulness 
 of the clenched eyes , and the soul 's vast distress 
 has she forgotten thus the old caress 
 that made our breath a quickened atmosphere 
 that failed nigh unto swooning with the sheer 
 delight ? mine arms clutch now this earthen heap 
 sodden with tears that flow on ceaselessly 
 as autumn rains the long , long , long nights weep 
 in memory of days that used to be 
 has she forgotten these ? and in her sleep 
 has she forgotten me — forgotten me 

over the threshold of his pleasant home 
 set in green clearings passed the exiled friend 
 in simple trust , misdoubting not the end 
 “ dear heart of mine ! ” he said , “ the time has come 
 to trust the lord for shelter . ” one long gaze 
 the goodwife turned on each familiar thing 
 the lowing kine , the orchard blossoming 
 the open door that showed the hearth fire 's blaze 
 and calmly answered , “ yes , he will provide 
 silent and slow they crossed the homestead 's bound 
 lingering the longest by their child 's grave mound 
 “ move on , or stay and hang ! ” the sheriff cried 
 they left behind them more than home or land 
 and set sad faces to an alien strand 

i care not that one listen if he lives 
 for aught but life 's romance , nor puts above 
 all life 's necessities the need to love 
 nor counts his greatest wealth what beauty gives 
 but sometime on an afternoon in spring 
 when dandelions dot the fields with gold 
 and under rustling shade a few weeks old 
 ‘ tis sweet to stroll and hear the bluebirds sing 
 do you , blond head , whom beauty and the power 
 of being young and winsome have prepared 
 for life 's last privilege that really pays 
 make the companion of an idle hour 
 these relics of the time when i too fared 
 across the sweet fifth lustrum of my days 

resolved to love , unworthy to obtain 
 i do no favour crave ; but , humble wise 
 to thee my sighs in verse i sacrifice 
 only some pity and no help to gain 
 hear then , and as my heart shall aye remain 
 a patient object to thy lightning eyes 
 a patient ear bring thou to thund'ring cries 
 fear not the crack , when i the blow sustain 
 so as thine eye bred mine ambitious thought 
 so shall thine ear make proud my voice for joy 
 lo , dear , what wonders great by thee are wrought 
 when i but little favour do enjoy 
 the voice is made the ear for to rejoice 
 and your ear giveth pleasure to my voice 

th ’ ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight 
 eager of action , and demand the fight 
 then king tolumnius , vers 'd in augurs ’ arts 
 cries out , and thus his boasted skill imparts 
 “ at length ‘ t is granted , what i long desir 'd 
 this , this is what my frequent vows requir 'd 
 ye gods , i take your omen , and obey 
 advance , my friends , and charge ! i lead the way 
 these are the foreign foes , whose impious band 
 like that rapacious bird , infest our land 
 but soon , like him , they shall be forc 'd to sea 
 by strength united , and forego the prey 
 your timely succor to your country bring 
 haste to the rescue , and redeem your king 

by holy motives led , and not chagrin 
 the hermit never spoke of what he 'd seen 
 but , from the youth 's discernment , strove to hide 
 whate'er regarded love , and much beside 
 the softer sex , with all their magick charms 
 that fill the feeling bosom with alarms 
 as years advanced , the boy with care he taught 
 what suited best his age before him brought 
 at five he showed him animals and flow'rs 
 the birds of air , the beasts , their sev'ral pow'rs 
 and now and then of hell he gave a hint 
 old satan 's wrath , and what might awe imprint 
 how formed , and doomed to infamy below 
 in childhood fear ‘ s the lesson first we know 

if so it hap this offspring of my care 
 these fatal anthems , lamentable songs 
 come to their view , who like afflicted are 
 let them yet sigh their own , and moan my wrongs 
 but untouched hearts with unaffected eye 
 approach not to behold my soul 's distress 
 clear sighted you soon note what is awry 
 whilst blinded souls mine errors never guess 
 you blinded souls , whom youth and error lead 
 you outcast eaglets dazzled with your sun 
 do you , and none but you , my sorrows read 
 you best can judge the wrongs that she hath done 
 that she hath done , the motive of my pain 
 who whilst i love doth kill me with disdain 

master of human destinies am i 
 fame , love , and fortune on my footsteps wait 
 cities and fields i walk ; i penetrate 
 deserts and seas remote , and passing by 
 hovel and mart and palace — soon or late 
 i knock , unbidden , once at every gate 
 if sleeping , wake — if feasting , rise before 
 i turn away . it is the hour of fate 
 and they who follow me reach every state 
 mortals desire , and conquer every foe 
 save death ; but those who doubt or hesitate 
 condemned to failure , penury , and woe 
 seek me in vain and uselessly implore 
 i answer not , and i return no more 

meantime the banish 'd polynices roves 
 ( his thebes abandon 'd ) through the aonian groves 
 while future realms his wandering thoughts delight 
 his daily vision , and his dream by night 
 forbidden thebes appears before his eye 
 from whence he sees his absent brother fly 
 with transport views the airy rule his own 
 and swells on an imaginary throne 
 fain would he cast a tedious age away 
 and live out all in one triumphant day 
 he chides the lazy progress of the sun 
 and bids the year with swifter motion run 
 with anxious hopes his craving mind is toss 'd 
 and all his joys in length of wishes lost 

the prioress , this secret to disclose 
 appeared with spectacles upon her nose 
 and twenty nuns around a dress displayed 
 that convent mantua makers never made 
 imagine to yourself what felt the youth 
 ‘ mid this examination of the truth 
 the nice proportions and the lily charms 
 soon raised within his bosom dire alarms 
 like magick operated on the string 
 and from it , what was tied , soon gave a spring 
 broke loose at once , just like a mettled steed 
 that , having slipt its halter , flies with speed 
 against the abbess ’ nose with force it flew 
 and spectacles from her proboscis threw 

but more than this what moves me most of all 
 to leave not all unworded and unsped 
 the whole heart 's greeting of my thanks unsaid 
 scarce needs this sign , that from my tongue should fall 
 his name whom sorrow and reverent love recall 
 the sign to friends on earth of that dear head 
 alive , which now long since untimely dead 
 the wan grey waters covered for a pall 
 their trustless reaches dense with tangling stems 
 took never life more taintless of rebuke 
 more pure and perfect , more serene and kind 
 than when those clear eyes closed beneath the thames 
 and made the now more hallowed name of luke 
 memorial to us of morning left behind 

little miss baster , of sunnyside 
 was known as a taster , far and wide 
 picking and licking , spying and prying 
 each bottle and dish with her fingers trying 
 dangerous practice ! dreadful little fact is 
 once almost poisoned , and very near dying 
 little miss baster , of sunnyside 
 has got some poison in paper tied 
 harmless she deems it , yes , she must taste 
 like sugar seems it , ah ! but ‘ tis paste

 run for the doctor , bid him not stay 
 dreadful her anguish — nearly she died 
 did little miss baster , of sunnyside 

grief dies like joy ; the tears upon my cheek 
 will disappear like dew . dear god ! i know 
 thy kindly providence hath made it so 
 and thank thee for the law . i am too weak 
 to make a friend of sorrow , or to wear 
 with that dark angel ever by my side 
 ( though to thy heaven there be no better guide 
 a front of manly calm . yet , for i hear 
 how woe hath cleansed , how grief can deify 
 so weak a thing it seems that grief should die 
 and love and friendship with it , i could pray 
 that if it might not gloom upon my brow 
 nor weigh upon my arm as it doth now 
 no grief of mine should ever pass away 

thy words are torture to me , that scarce grieve thee 
 that entire death shall null my entire thought 
 and i feel torture , not that i believe thee 
 but that i cannot disbelieve thee not 
 shall that of me that now contains the stars 
 be by the very contained stars survived 
 thus were fate all unjust . yet what truth bars 
 an all unjust fate ’ s truth from being believed 
 conjecture cannot fit to the seen world 
 a garment of its thought untorn or covering 
 or with its stuffed garb forge an otherworld 
 without itself its dead deceit discovering 
 so , all being possible , an idle thought may 
 less idle thoughts , self known no truer , dismay

 with willingness crowned everywhere about

 his heart 's blood dashing in the face of doubt 
 love 's last victorious stand amid the rout

there 's never a delicate nurseling of the year 
 but our huge london hails it , and delights 
 to wear it on her breast or at her ear 
 her days to colour and make sweet her nights 
 crocus and daffodil and violet 
 pink , primrose , valley lily , clove carnation 
 red rose and white rose , wall flower , mignonette 
 the daisies all — these be her recreation 
 her gaudies these ! and forth from drury lane 
 trapesing in any of her whirl of weathers 
 her flower girls foot it , honest and hoarse and vain

 of populous corners right advantage taking 
 and , where they squat , endlessly posy making 

when shall i see the white thorn leaves agen 
 and yellowhammers gathering the dry bents

 rude is the tent this architect invents

 dead grass , horse hair , and downy headed bents 
 tied to dead thistles — she doth well provide 
 close to a hill of ants where cowslips bloom 
 and shed oer meadows far their sweet perfume 
 in early spring , when winds blow chilly cold 
 the yellowhammer , trailing grass , will come 
 to fix a place and choose an early home

a frame which may be that of hercules 
 it hath such giant members ! and its port 
 is martial as e'er marked a caesar 's moving 
 its sandals are of brass , its massive brow 
 is helmeted in steel , and in its hand 
 it bears a sword with which , in idle strokes 
 it vainly beats the unresisting air 
 as if in battle with some phantom foe 
 and at each blow it deals , a strong fatality 
 turns back its sword 's keen point on its own breast 
 which deep it gashes ,— then in mournful tone 
 it mutters o'er and o'er again these words 
 “ i fought for fame and won unending wo 
 his agonies seem like himself , immortal 

one might believe that natural miseries 
 had blasted france , and made of it a land 
 unfit for men ; and that in one great band 
 her sons were bursting forth , to dwell at ease 
 but ‘ tis a chosen soil , where sun and breeze 
 shed gentle favours : rural works are there 
 and ordinary business without care 
 spot rich in all things that can soothe and please 
 how piteous then that there should be such dearth 
 of knowledge ; that whole myriads should unite 
 to work against themselves such fell despite 
 should come in phrensy and in drunken mirth 
 impatient to put out the only light 
 of liberty that yet remains on earth 

through suffering and sorrow thou hast passed 
 to show us what a woman true may be 
 they have not taken sympathy from thee 
 nor made thee any other than thou wast 
 save as some tree , which , in a sudden blast 
 sheddeth those blossoms , that are weakly grown 
 upon the air , but keepeth every one 
 whose strength gives warrant of good fruit at last 
 so thou hast shed some blooms of gayety 
 but never one of steadfast cheerfulness 
 nor hath thy knowledge of adversity 
 robbed thee of any faith in happiness 
 but rather cleared thine inner eyes to see 
 how many simple ways there are to bless 

so take these kindly , even though there be 
 some notes that unto other lyres belong 
 stray echoes from the elder sons of song 
 and think how from its neighbouring native sea 
 the pensive shell doth borrow melody 
 i would not do the lordly masters wrong 
 by filching fair words from the shining throng 
 whose music haunts me as the wind a tree 
 lo , when a stranger in soft syrian glooms 
 shot through with sunset , treads the cedar dells 
 and hears the breezy ring of elfin bells 
 far down be where the white haired cataract booms 
 he , faint with sweetness caught from forest smells 
 bears thence , unwitting , plunder of perfumes 

i saw , sweet licia , when the spider ran 
 within your house to weave a worthless web 
 you present were and feared her with your fan 
 so that amaz è d speedily she fled 
 she in your house such sweet perfumes did smell 
 and heard the muses with their notes refined 
 thus filled with envy , could no longer dwell 
 but straight returned and at your house repined 
 then tell me , spider , why of late i saw 
 thee lose thy poison , and thy bowels gone 
 did these enchant and keep thy limbs in awe 
 and made thy forces to be small or none 
 no , no , thou didst by chance my licia see 
 who for her look minerva seemed to thee 

lawrence , what though the world be growing dark 
 and twilight cool thy potent day inclose 
 the sun , beneath the round earth sunk , still glows 
 all the night through , sleepless and young and stark 
 oh , be thy spirit faithful as the lark 
 more daring : in the midnight of thy woes 
 dart through them , higher than earth 's shadow goes 
 into the light of which thou art a spark 
 be willing to be blind — that , in thy night 
 the lord may bring his father to thy door 
 and enter in , and feast thy soul with light 
 then shall thou dream of darksome ways no more 
 forget the gloom that round thy windows lies 
 and shine , god 's house , all radiant in our eyes 

‘ my dearest lord ! farewell , ’ said he , ‘ farewell 
 heaven bless the king ; may no misfortune tell 
 the injustice of his hate when i am dead 
 they 're coming now ; perhaps my guiltless head 
 here , in your sight , must then a bleeding lie 
 and scarce your own stand safe for being nigh 
 think me not scared with death , howe'er ‘ t appear 
 i know thou canst not think so : it is a fear 
 from which thy love and dammin speaks me free 
 i 've met him face to face , and ne'er could see 
 one terror in his looks to make me fly 
 when virtue bids me stand ; but i would die 
 so as becomes my life , so as may prove 
 saul 's malice , and at least excuse your love 

not long i had observed , when from afar 
 i heard a sudden symphony of war 
 the neighing coursers , and the soldiers cry 
 and sounding trumps , that seem 'd to tear the sky 
 i saw soon after this , behind the grove 
 from whence the ladies did in order move 
 come issuing out in arms a warrior train 
 that like a deluge pour 'd upon the plain 
 on barbed steeds they rode in proud array 
 thick as the college of the bees in may 
 when swarming o'er the dusky fields they fly 
 new to the flowers , and intercept the sky 
 so fierce they drove , their coursers were so fleet 
 that the turf trembled underneath their feet 

— “ and where is my cat ? ” a vixen squalled 
 “ yes , where are our cats ? ” the witches bawled 
 and began to call them all by name 
 as fast as they called the cats , they came 
 there was bob tailed tommy and long tailed tim 
 and wall eyed jacky and green eyed jim 
 and splay foot benny and slim legged beau 
 and skinny and squally , and jerry and joe 
 and many another that came at call 
 it would take too long to count them all 
 all black ,— one could hardly tell which was which 
 but every cat knew his own old witch 
 and she knew hers as hers knew her 
 ah , did n't they curl their tails and purr 

“ the land of cyclops first , a savage kind 
 nor tamed by manners , nor by laws confined 
 untaught to plant , to turn the glebe , and sow 
 they all their products to free nature owe 
 the soil , untill 'd , a ready harvest yields 
 with wheat and barley wave the golden fields 
 spontaneous wines from weighty clusters pour 
 and jove descends in each prolific shower 
 by these no statues and no rights are known 
 no council held , no monarch fills the throne 
 but high on hills , or airy cliffs , they dwell 
 or deep in caves whose entrance leads to hell 
 each rules his race , his neighbour not his care 
 heedless of others , to his own severe 

whose are the gilded tents that crowd the way 
 where all was waste and silent yesterday 
 this city of war which , in a few short hours 
 hath sprung up here , as if the magic powers 
 of him who , in the twinkling of a star 
 built the high pillared halls of chilminar 
 had conjur 'd up , far as the eye can see 
 this world of tents and domes and sunbright armory 
 princely pavilions screened by many a fold 
 of crimson cloth and topt with balls of gold 
 steeds with their housings of rich silver spun 
 their chains and poitrels glittering in the sun 
 and camels tufted o'er with yemen 's shells 
 shaking in every breeze their light toned bells 

insect or blossom ? fragile , fairy thing 
 poised upon slender tip , and quivering 
 to flight ! a flower of the fields of air 
 a jeweled moth ; a butterfly , with rare 
 and tender tints upon his downy wings 
 a moment resting in our happy sight 
 a flower held captive by a thread so slight 
 its petal wings of broidered gossamer 
 are light as the wind , with every wind astir 
 wafting sweet odor , faint and exquisite 
 o dainty nursling of the field and sky 
 what fairer thing looks up to heaven 's blue 
 and drinks the noontide sun , the dawning 's dew 
 thou winged bloom ! thou blossom butterfly 

no rose that in a garden ever grew 
 in homer 's or in omar 's or in mine 
 though buried under centuries of fine 
 dead dust of roses , shut from sun and dew 
 forever , and forever lost from view 
 but must again in fragrance rich as wine 
 the grey aisles of the air incarnadine 
 when the old summers surge into a new 
 thus when i swear , “ i love with all my heart 
 ‘ tis with the heart of lilith that i swear 
 ‘ tis with the love of lesbia and lucrece 
 and thus as well my love must lose some part 
 of what it is , had helen been less fair 
 or perished young , or stayed at home in greece 

the world is too much with us ; late and soon 
 getting and spending , we lay waste our powers 
 little we see in nature that is ours 
 we have given our hearts away , a sordid boon 
 this sea that bares her bosom to the moon 
 the winds that will be howling at all hours 
 and are up gathered now like sleeping flowers 
 for this , for every thing , we are out of tune 
 it moves us not — great god ! i 'd rather be 
 a pagan suckled in a creed outworn 
 so might i , standing on this pleasant lea 
 have glimpses that would make me less forlorn 
 have sight of proteus coming from the sea 
 or hear old triton blow his wreathed horn 

there is a bondage which is worse to bear 
 than his who breathes , by roof , and floor , and wall 
 pent in , a tyrant 's solitary thrall 
 ‘ tis his who walks about in the open air 
 one of a nation who , henceforth , must wear 
 their fetters in their souls . for who could be 
 who , even the best , in such condition , free 
 from self reproach , reproach which he must share 
 with human nature ? never be it ours 
 to see the sun how brightly it will shine 
 and know that noble feelings , manly powers 
 instead of gathering strength must droop and pine 
 and earth with all her pleasant fruits and flowers 
 fade , and participate in man 's decline 

the wandering mariner , whose eye explores 
 the wealthiest isles , the most enchanting shores 
 views not a realm so bountiful and fair 
 nor breathes the spirit of a purer air 
 in every clime , the magnet of his soul 
 touched by remembrance , trembles to that pole 
 for in this land of heaven 's peculiar grace 
 the heritage of nature 's noblest race 
 there is a spot of earth supremely blest 
 a dearer , sweeter spot than all the rest 
 where man , creation 's tyrant , casts aside 
 his sword and sceptre , pageantry and pride 
 while , in his softened looks , benignly blend 
 the sire , the son , the husband , brother , friend 

so is it with this singing art of ours 
 that once with maids went maidenlike , and played 
 with woven dances in the poplar shade 
 and all her song was but of lady 's bowers 
 and the returning swallows , and spring flowers 
 till forth to seek a shadow queen she strayed 
 a shadowy land ; and now hath overweighed 
 her singing chaplet with the snow and showers 
 yes , fair well water for the bitter brine 
 she left , and by the margin of life 's sea 
 sings , and her song is full of the sea 's moan 
 and wild with dread , and love of proserpine 
 and whoso once has listened to her , he 
 his whole life long is slave to her alone 

thy bosom is endeared with all hearts 
 which i by lacking have supposed dead 
 and there reigns love and all love 's loving parts 
 and all those friends which i thought buried 
 how many a holy and obsequious tear 
 hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye 
 as interest of the dead , which now appear 
 but things removed that hidden in thee lie 
 thou art the grave where buried love doth live 
 hung with the trophies of my lovers gone 
 who all their parts of me to thee did give 
 that due of many , now is thine alone 
 their images i loved , i view in thee 
 and thou ( all they ) hast all the all of me 

what i have instanced only in the best 
 is , in proportion , true of all the rest 
 take pains the genuine meaning to explore 
 there sweat , there strain : tug the laborious oar 
 search every comment that your care can find 
 some here , some there , may hit the poet 's mind 
 yet be not blindly guided by the throng 
 the multitude is always in the wrong 
 when things appear unnatural or hard 
 consult your author , with himself compared 
 who knows what blessing phoebus may bestow 
 and future ages to your labour owe 
 such secrets are not easily found out 
 but , once discovered , leave no room for doubt 

it was the time when rest , soft sliding downe 
 from heavens hight into mens heavy eyes 
 in the forgetfulnes of sleepe doth drowne 
 the carefull thoughts of mortall miseries 
 then did a ghost before mine eyes appeare 
 on that great rivers banck that runnes by rome 
 which , calling me by name , bad me to reare 
 my lookes to heaven whence all good gifts do come 
 and crying lowd , “ loe ! now beholde , ” quoth hee 
 “ what under this great temple placed is 
 lo , all is nought but flying vanitee 
 so i , that know this worlds inconstancies 
 sith onely god surmounts all times decay 
 in god alone my confidence do stay 

so , silence reconciles life 's jarring phrases 
 far in the future , austere and august 
 meanwhile , the buds of the poplars are falling 
 spring 's on the lawn , and a little voice calling 
 “ daddy , come out ! daddy darling , you must 
 daddy come out and help molly pick daisies 
 and , since one 's here , and the spring 's in the garden 
 ( how many lives hence will that thought earn pardon 
 since one 's a man and man 's heart is insistent 
 and , since nirvana is doubtful and distant 
 though life 's a hard road and thorny to travel 
 stones in the borders and grass on the gravel 
 still there 's the wisdom that wise men call folly 
 still one can go and pick daisies with molly 

o how thy worth with manners may i sing 
 when thou art all the better part of me 
 what can mine own praise to mine own self bring 
 and what is't but mine own when i praise thee 
 even for this , let us divided live 
 and our dear love lose name of single one 
 that by this separation i may give 
 that due to thee which thou deserv'st alone 
 o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove 
 were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave 
 to entertain the time with thoughts of love 
 which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive 
 and that thou teachest how to make one twain 
 by praising him here who doth hence remain 

two little children played among the flowers 
 their mothers were of kin , tho ’ far apart 
 the children 's ages were the very same 
 e'en to an hour — and ethel was her name 
 a fair , sweet girl , with great , brown , wond'ring eyes 
 that seemed to listen just as if they held 
 the gift of hearing with the power of sight 
 six summers slept upon her low white brow 
 and dreamed amid the roses of her cheeks 
 her voice was sweetly low ; and when she spoke 
 her words were music ; and her laughter rang 
 so like an altar bell that , had you heard 
 its silvery sound a ringing , you would think 
 of kneeling down and worshiping the pure 

now low on earth the lofty chief is laid 
 with eyes cast upward , and with arms display 'd 
 and , recreant , thus to the proud victor pray 'd 
 “ i know my death deserv 'd , nor hope to live 
 use what the gods and thy good fortune give 
 yet think , o think , if mercy may be shown  
 thou hadst a father once , and hast a son  
 pity my sire , now sinking to the grave 
 and for anchises ’ sake old daunus save 
 or , if thy vow 'd revenge pursue my death 
 give to my friends my body void of breath 
 the latian chiefs have seen me beg my life 
 thine is the conquest , thine the royal wife 
 against a yielded man , ‘ t is mean ignoble strife 

then eviradnus , true to his intent 
 stripped to his utrecht jerkin ; but the while 
 he calmly had disarmed — with dexterous guile 
 had ladisl ä us seized a knife that lay 
 upon the damask cloth , and slipped away 
 his shoes ; then barefoot , swiftly , silently 
 he crept behind the knight , with arm held high 
 but eviradnus was of all aware 
 and turned upon the murderous weapon there 
 and twisted it away ; then in a trice 
 his strong colossal hand grasped like a vice 
 the neck of ladisl ä us , who the blade 
 now dropped ; over his eyes a misty shade 
 showed that the royal dwarf was near to death 

quirinus , bacchus , and the jove born pair 
 though now invoked with in cense , gifts , and prayer 
 while yet on earth they civilized their kind 
 tilled lands , built cities , properties assigned 
 oft mourned for man 's ingratitude , and found 
 the race they served less thankful than the ground 
 the prince whose fated vassalage subdued 
 fell hydra 's power and all the monster brood 
 soon found that envy , worse than all beside 
 could only be extinguished when he died 
 he that outshines his age is like a torch 
 which , when it blazes high , is apt to scorch 
 men hate him while he lives : at last , no doubt 
 he wins affection — when his light is out 

much have i traveled in the realms of gold 
 and many goodly states and kingdoms seen 
 round many western islands have i been 
 which bards in fealty to apollo hold 
 oft of one wide expanse had i been told 
 that deep brow 'd homer ruled as his demesne 
 yet did i never breathe its pure serene 
 till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold 
 then felt i like some watcher of the skies 
 when a new planet swims into his ken 
 or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes 
 he star 'd at the pacific — and all his men 
 look 'd at each other with a wild surmise 
 silent , upon a peak in darien 

come back to me , who wait and watch for you 
 or come not yet , for it is over then 
 and long it is before you come again 
 so far between my pleasures are and few 
 while , when you come not , what i do i do 
 thinking “ now when he comes , ” my sweetest “ when 
 for one man is my world of all the men 
 this wide world holds ; o love , my world is you 
 howbeit , to meet you grows almost a pang 
 because the pang of parting comes so soon 
 my hope hangs waning , waxing , like a moon 
 between the heavenly days on which we meet 
 ah me , but where are now the songs i sang 
 when life was sweet because you called them sweet 

a painter drew the image of the boy 
 swift love , with wings all naked , and yet blind 
 with bow and arrows , bent for to destroy 
 i blamed his skill , and fault i thus did find 
 “ a needless task i see thy cunning take 
 misled by love , thy fancy thee betrayed 
 love is no boy , nor blind , as men him make 
 nor weapons wears , whereof to be affrayed 
 but if thou , love , wilt paint with greatest skill 
 a love , a maid , a goddess , and a queen 
 wonder and view at licia 's picture still 
 for other love the world hath never seen 
 for she alone all hope all comfort gives 
 men 's hearts , souls , all , led by her favour lives 

poet ! if on a lasting fame be bent 
 thy unperturbing hopes , thou will not roam 
 too far from thine own happy heart and home 
 cling to the lowly earth , and be content 
 so shall thy name be dear to many a heart 
 so shall the noblest truths by thee be taught 
 the flower and fruit of wholesome human thought 
 bless the sweet labors of thy gentle art 
 the brightest stars are nearest to the earth 
 and we may track the mighty sun above 
 even by the shadow of a slender flower 
 always , o bard , humility is power 
 and thou mayst draw from matters of the hearth 
 truths wide as nations , and as deep as love 

then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes 
 and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he 
 remembered in what a haughtier guise 
 he had flung an alms to leprosie 
 when he girt his young life up in gilded mail 
 and set forth in search of the holy grail 
 the heart within him was ashes and dust 
 he parted in twain his single crust 
 he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink 
 and gave the leper to eat and drink 
 ‘ twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread 
 ‘ twas water out of a wooden bowl 
 yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed 
 and ‘ twas red wine he drank with his thirsty soul 

a ladder , which my ken pursued in vain 
 so lofty was the summit ; down whose steps 
 i saw the splendours in such multitude 
 descending , ev'ry light in heav'n , methought 
 was shed thence . as the rooks , at dawn of day 
 bestirring them to dry their feathers chill 
 some speed their way a field , and homeward some 
 returning , cross their flight , while some abide 
 and wheel around their airy lodge ; so seem 'd 
 that glitterance , wafted on alternate wing 
 as upon certain stair it met , and clash 'd 
 its shining . and one ling'ring near us , wax 'd 
 so bright , that in my thought : said : “ the love 
 which this betokens me , admits no doubt 

if he be dead , in whom no heart remains 
 or lifeless be in whom no life is found 
 if he do pine that never comfort gains 
 and be distressed that hath his deadly wound 
 then must i die whose heart elsewhere is clad 
 and lifeless pass the greedy worms to feed 
 then must i pine that never comfort had 
 and be distressed whose wound with tears doth bleed 
 which if i do , why do i not wax cold 
 why rest i not like one that wants a heart 
 why move i still like him that life doth hold 
 and sense enjoy both of my joy and smart 
 like niobe queen which made a stone did weep 
 licia my heart dead and alive doth keep 

euboea next her martial sons prepares 
 and sends the brave abantes to the wars 
 breathing revenge , in arms they take their way 
 from chalcis ’ walls , and strong eretria 
 the isteian fields for generous vines renown ’ d 
 the fair caristos , and the styrian ground 
 where dios from her towers o ’ erlooks the plain 
 and high cerinthus views the neighbouring main 
 down their broad shoulders falls a length of hair 
 their hands dismiss not the long lance in air 
 but with protended spears in fighting fields 
 pierce the tough corslets and the brazen shields 
 twice twenty ships transport the warlike bands 
 which bold elphenor , fierce in arms , commands 

he spoke , and enid easily believed 
 like simple noble natures , credulous 
 of what they long for , good in friend or foe 
 there most in those who most have done them ill 
 and when they reached the camp the king himself 
 advanced to greet them , and beholding her 
 though pale , yet happy , asked her not a word 
 but went apart with edyrn , whom he held 
 in converse for a little , and returned 
 and , gravely smiling , lifted her from horse 
 and kissed her with all pureness , brother like 
 and showed an empty tent allotted her 
 and glancing for a minute , till he saw her 
 pass into it , turned to the prince , and said 

nor can i not believe but that hereby 
 great gains are mine : for thus i live remote 
 from evil speaking ; rancour , never sought 
 comes to me not ; malignant truth , or lie 
 hence have i genial seasons , hence have i 
 smooth passions , smooth discourse , and joyous thought 
 and thus from day to day my little boat 
 rocks in its harbour , lodging peaceably 
 blessings be with them , and eternal praise 
 who gave us nobler loves , and nobler cares 
 the poets , who on earth have made us heirs 
 of truth and pure delight by heavenly lays 
 oh ! might my name be numbered among theirs 
 then gladly would i end my mortal days 

sweet love renew thy force , be it not said 
 thy edge should blunter be than appetite 
 which but to day by feeding is allayed 
 to morrow sharpened in his former might 
 so love be thou , although to day thou fill 
 thy hungry eyes , even till they wink with fulness 
 to morrow see again , and do not kill 
 the spirit of love , with a perpetual dulness 
 let this sad interim like the ocean be 
 which parts the shore , where two contracted new 
 come daily to the banks , that when they see 
 return of love , more blest may be the view 
 or call it winter , which being full of care 
 makes summer 's welcome , thrice more wished , more rare 

but what avail inadequate words to reach 
 the innermost of truth ? who shall essay 
 blinded and weak , to point and lead the way 
 or solve the mystery in familiar speech 
 yet , if it be that something not thy own 
 some shadow of the thought to which our schemes 
 creeds , cult , and ritual are at best but dreams 
 is even to thy unworthiness made known 
 thou mayst not hide what yet thou shouldst not dare 
 to utter lightly , lest on lips of thine 
 the real seem false , the beauty undivine 
 so , weighing duty in the scale of prayer 
 give what seems given thee . it may prove a seed 
 of goodness dropped in fallow grounds of need 

the soverayne beauty which i doo admyre 
 witnesse the world how worthy to be prayzed 
 the light wherof hath kindled heavenly fyre 
 in my fraile spirit , by her from basenesse raysed 
 that being now with her huge brightnesse dazed 
 base thing i can no more endure to view 
 but , looking still on her , i stand amazed 
 at wondrous sight of so celestiall hew 
 so when my toung would speak her praises dew 
 it stopped is with thoughts astonishment 
 and when my pen would write her titles true 
 it ravisht is with fancies wonderment 
 yet in my hart i then both speak and write 
 the wonder that my wit cannot endite 

kneeling in prayer , her spirit rapt above 
 she meets with god , who bendeth , brooding low 
 in vast compassion humanward , and so 
 there comes upon her life the power of love 
 rising — behold ! with pinions like a dove 
 an angel with a rod where row on row 
 of chaliced lilies spill supernal glow 
 which all her thought to wonder mute doth move 
 then falls upon the rapture of her soul 
 dimly some vision of gethsemane 
 athwart the resurrection 's shining goal 
 and with uplifted hand she pleads as one 
 shall pray in night of darkest agony 
 “ this cup remove ,— yet , lord , thy will be done 

safer with winds and waves than human wrath 
 with ravening wolves than those whose zeal for god 
 was cruelty to man , the exiles trod 
 drear leagues of forest without guide or path 
 or launching frail boats on the uncharted sea 
 round storm vexed capes , whose teeth of granite ground 
 the waves to foam , their perilous way they wound 
 enduring all things so their souls were free 
 oh , true confessors , shaming them who did 
 anew the wrong their pilgrim fathers bore 
 for you the mayflower spread her sail once more 
 freighted with souls , to all that duty bid 
 faithful as they who sought an unknown land 
 o'er wintry seas , from holland 's hook of sand 

at length they thought of those poor hearts at home 
 mother and sister , watching through the night 
 waiting and watching through the livelong day 
 startled at every step , at every sound 
 startled at every bier that came in view 
 in that great city of the stranger dead 
 that city where the living come to die 
 and home returned when evening 's rose and gold 
 had faded from the sky , and myriad lamps 
 danced on the sacred stream , and moon and stars 
 hung quivering in its dark and silent depths 
 but day by day returned , eager to hear 
 more of that truth that sweetens daily life 
 yet reaches upward to eternal day 

death in a rage assaulted once my heart 
 with love of her , my love that doth deny 
 i scorned his force , and wished him to depart 
 i heartless was , and therefore could not die 
 i live in her , in her i placed my life 
 she guides my soul , and her i honour must 
 nor is this life but yet a living strife 
 a thing unmeet , and yet a thing most just 
 cupid enraged did fly to make me love 
 my heart lay guarded with those burning eyes 
 the sparks whereof denied him to remove 
 so conquered now , he like a captive lies 
 thus two at once by love were both undone 
 my heart not loved , and armless venus ’ son 

i wandered through scoglietto 's far retreat 
 the oranges on each o'erhanging spray 
 burned as bright lamps of gold to shame the day 
 some startled bird with fluttering wings and fleet 
 made snow of all the blossoms ; at my feet 
 like silver moons the pale narcissi lay 
 and the curved waves that streaked the great green bay 
 laughed i ’ the sun , and life seemed very sweet 
 outside the young boy priest passed singing clear 
 ‘ jesus the son of mary has been slain 
 o come and fill his sepulchre with flowers 
 ah , god ! ah , god ! those dear hellenic hours 
 had drowned all memory of thy bitter pain 
 the cross , the crown , the soldiers and the spear 

this then at last ; we may be wiser far 
 than love , and put his folly to our measure 
 yet shall we learn , poor wizards that we are 
 that love chimes not nor motions at our pleasure 
 we bid him come , and light an eager fire 
 and he goes down the road without debating 
 we cast him from the house of our desire 
 and when at last we leave he will be waiting 
 and in the end there is no folly but this 
 to counsel love out of our little learning 
 for still he knows where rotten timber is 
 and where the boughs for the long winter burning 
 and when life needs no more of us at all 
 love 's word will be the last that we recall 

once in a dream ( for once i dreamed of you 
 we stood together in an open field 
 above our heads two swift winged pigeons wheeled 
 sporting at ease and courting full in view 
 when loftier still a broadening darkness flew 
 down swooping , and a ravenous hawk revealed 
 too weak to fight , too fond to fly , they yield 
 so farewell life and love and pleasures new 
 then as their plumes fell fluttering to the ground 
 their snow white plumage flecked with crimson drops 
 i wept , and thought i turned towards you to weep 
 but you were gone ; while rustling hedgerow tops 
 bent in a wind which bore to me a sound 
 of far off piteous bleat of lambs and sheep 

he seyde , ‘ appollo , god and governour 
 of every plaunte , herbe , tree and flour

 how that i may been holpe and in what wyse 

fair eyes , whilst fearful i your fair admire 
 by unexpress è d sweetness that i gain 
 my memory of sorrow doth expire 
 and falcon like , i tower joy 's heavens amain 
 but when your suns in oceans of their glory 
 shut up their day bright shine , i die for thought 
 so pass my joys as doth a new played story 
 and one poor sigh breathes all delight to naught 
 so to myself i live not , but for you 
 for you i live , and you i love , but none else 
 oh then , fair eyes , whose light i live to view 
 or poor forlorn despised to live alone else 
 look sweet , since from the pith of contemplation 
 love gathereth life , and living , breedeth passion 

how can i then return in happy plight 
 that am debarred the benefit of rest 
 when day 's oppression is not eased by night 
 but day by night and night by day oppressed 
 and each ( though enemies to either 's reign 
 do in consent shake hands to torture me 
 the one by toil , the other to complain 
 how far i toil , still farther off from thee 
 i tell the day to please him thou art bright 
 and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven 
 so flatter i the swart complexioned night 
 when sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even 
 but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer 
 and night doth nightly make grief 's length seem stronger 

and izdubar turned from the halls and goes 
 toward a fountain in the park , whence flows 
 a merry stream toward the wood . he finds 
 an axe beside the fount , and thoughtful winds 
 through groves of sandal wood and mastic trees 
 and algum , umritgana . now he sees 
 the sig a ri and ummakana , pines 
 with babuaku ; and ri wood brightly shines 
 among the azuhu ; all precious woods 
 that man esteems are grown around , each buds 
 continuous in the softened , balmy air 
 he stops beneath a musrilkanna where 
 the pine trees spread toward the glowing sea 
 wild mingled with the surman , sa u ri 

my delia hath the waters of mine eyes 
 the ready handmaids on her grace t'attend 
 that never fail to ebb , but ever rise 
 for to their flow she never grants an end 
 the ocean never did attend more duly 
 upon his sovereign 's course , the night 's pale queen 
 nor paid the impost of his waves more truly 
 than mine unto her cruelty hath been 
 yet nought the rock of that hard heart can move 
 where beat these tears with zeal , and fury drives 
 and yet , i 'd rather languish in her love 
 than i would joy the fairest she that lives 
 and if i find such pleasure to complain 
 what should i do then if i should obtain 

guarded within the old red wall 's embrace 
 marshalled like soldiers in gay company 
 the tulips stand arrayed . here infantry 
 wheels out into the sunlight . what bold grace 
 sets off their tunics , white with crimson lace 
 here are platoons of gold frocked cavalry 
 with scarlet sabres tossing in the eye 
 of purple batteries , every gun in place 
 forward they come , with flaunting colours spread 
 with torches burning , stepping out in time 
 to some quick , unheard march . our ears are dead 
 we cannot catch the tune . in pantomime 
 parades that army . with our utmost powers 
 we hear the wind stream through a bed of flowers 

now surely is the hour come for farewell 
 now , with the lessened light and darkened days 
 who now would tread the wild hill 's pathless ways 
 we found so fair when spring and summer 's spell 
 made blind our hearts this parting to foretell 
 yet why , while wan and wintry sunlight stays 
 on perished gold of autumn fields , delays 
 your heart to speak , while both our hearts rebel 
 together we have gathered through the year 
 all that the year could give us of its best 
 is it not meet our parting should be here 
 now in the season drear of death and rest 
 yet since together we its joys have known 
 how shall each meet the strange new year alone 

next to tydides , agamemnon came 
 and menelaus , atreus ’ godlike sons 
 th ’ ajaces both , in dauntless courage cloth 'd 
 idomeneus , with whom meriones 
 his faithful comrade , terrible as mars 
 eurypylus , euaemon 's noble son 
 the ninth was teucer , who , with bended bow 
 behind the shield of ajax telamon 
 took shelter ; ajax o'er him held his shield 
 thence look 'd he round , and aim 'd amid the crowd 
 and as he saw each trojan , wounded , fall 
 struck by his shafts , to ajax close he press 'd 
 as to its mother 's shelt'ring arms a child

struck with amaze , yet still to doubt inclined 
 he stands suspended , and explores his mind 
 “ what shall i do ? unhappy me ! who knows 
 but other gods intend me other woes 
 whoe'er thou art , i shall not blindly join 
 thy pleaded reason , but consult with mine 
 for scarce in ken appears that distant isle 
 thy voice foretells me shall conclude my toil 
 thus then i judge : while yet the planks sustain 
 the wild waves ’ fury , here i fix 'd remain 
 but , when their texture to the tempest yields 
 i launch adventurous on the liquid fields 
 join to the help of gods the strength of man 
 and take this method , since the best i can 

where is the painter who shall paint for you 
 my austral brothers , with a pencil steeped 
 in hues of truth , the weather smitten crew 
 who gazed on unknown shores — a thoughtful few 
 what time the heart of their great leader leaped 
 till he was faint with pain of longing ? new 
 and wondrous sights on each and every hand 
 like strange supernal visions , grew and grew 
 until the rocks and trees , and sea and sand 
 danced madly in the tear bewildered view 
 and from the surf a fierce , fantastic band 
 of startled wild men to the hills withdrew 
 with yells of fear ! who 'll paint thy face , o cook

arion , when , through tempests cruel wracke 
 he forth was thrown into the greedy seas 
 through the sweet musick which his harp did make 
 allur 'd a dolphin him from death to ease 
 but my rude musick , which was wont to please 
 some dainty eares , cannot , with any skill 
 the dreadfull tempest of her wrath appease 
 nor move the dolphin from her stubborn will 
 but in her pride she dooth persever still 
 all carelesse how my life for her decayes

the peasant ‘ gan to turn things in his mind 
 said he , to take the heads i 'm not inclined

 to eat the garlick thus , would prove a curse 
 nor can i suffer on my tender back 
 that , with a cudgel , thirty blows you thwack 
 still harder thirty pounds to pay appeared 
 uncertain how to act , he hanging feared 
 the noble peer he begged , upon his knees

deep in the shady sadness of a vale 
 far sunken from the healthy breath of morn 
 far from the fiery noon , and eve 's one star 
 sat gray hair 'd saturn , quiet as a stone 
 still as the silence round about his lair 
 forest on forest hung about his head 
 like cloud on cloud . no stir of air was there 
 not so much life as on a summer 's day 
 robs not one light seed from the feather 'd grass 
 but where the dead leaf fell , there did it rest 
 a stream went voiceless by , still deadened more 
 by reason of his fallen divinity 
 spreading a shade : the naiad ‘ mid her reeds 
 press 'd her cold finger closer to her lips 

the knave of diamonds tries his wily arts 
 and wins ( oh shameful chance !) the queen of hearts 
 at this the blood the virgin 's cheek forsook 
 a livid paleness spreads o'er all her look 
 she sees , and trembles at th ’ approaching ill 
 just in the jaws of ruin , and codille 
 and now ( as oft in some distempered state 
 on one nice trick depends the general fate 
 an ace of hearts steps forth ; the king unseen 
 lurked in her hand , and mourned his captive queen 
 he springs to vengeance with an eager pace 
 and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace 
 the nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky 
 the walls , the woods , and long canals reply 

the shepherd on his journey heard when nigh 
 his dog among the bushes barking high 
 the ploughman ran and gave a hearty shout 
 he found a weary fox and beat him out 
 the ploughman laughed and would have ploughed him in 
 but the old shepherd took him for the skin 
 he lay upon the furrow stretched for dead 
 the old dog lay and licked the wounds that bled 
 the ploughman beat him till his ribs would crack 
 and then the shepherd slung him at his back 
 and when he rested , to his dog 's surprise 
 the old fox started from his dead disguise 
 and while the dog lay panting in the sedge 
 he up and snapt and bolted through the hedge 

“ earth has not anything to show more fair

 more than i merit , yes , by many times

 treason , and durst not turn to whence he is fled

of old i wandered by the river 's side 
 between whose banks the mighty waters glide 
 where vast niagara , hurrying to its fall 
 builds and unbuilds its ever tumbling wall 
 oft in my dreams i hear the rush and roar 
 of battling floods , and feel the trembling shore 
 as the huge torrent , girded for its leap 
 with bellowing thunders plunges down the steep 
 not less distinct , from memory 's pictured urn 
 the gray old rock , the leafy woods , return 
 robed in their pride the lofty oaks appear 
 and once again with quickened sense i hear 
 through the low murmur of the leaves that stir 
 the tinkling teardrop of la roche qui pleure

i loved you first : but afterwards your love 
 outsoaring mine , sang such a loftier song 
 as drowned the friendly cooings of my dove 
 which owes the other most ? my love was long 
 and yours one moment seemed to wax more strong 
 i loved and guessed at you , you construed me 
 and loved me for what might or might not be 
 nay , weights and measures do us both a wrong 
 for verily love knows not “ mine ” or “ thine 
 with separate “ i ” and “ thou ” free love has done 
 for one is both and both are one in love 
 rich love knows nought of “ thine that is not mine 
 both have the strength and both the length thereof 
 both of us of the love which makes us one 

as some poor starveling at a palace gate 
 sees curtained gleams from banquet litten halls 
 hears song out ringing from the festal walls 
 scents viands that shall princely palates sate 
 yet in the outer gloom may only wait 
 crouched in the cold , thrice thankful for some least 
 mean morsel flung him from the plenteous feast 
 poor bondman to the ball and chain of fate 
 so , lonely at love 's outer gate i stand 
 and glimpse the brightness and the bliss within 
 where love lit smiles transmute the dark to day 
 i wait without — i may not enter in 
 long , wistfully , i gaze — then void of hand 
 and starved of spirit , sadly turn away 

inclos 'd with hills , a winding valley lies 
 by nature form 'd for fraud , and fitted for surprise 
 a narrow track , by human steps untrode 
 leads , thro ’ perplexing thorns , to this obscure abode 
 high o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands 
 whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands 
 the top is level , an offensive seat 
 of war ; and from the war a safe retreat 
 for , on the right and left , is room to press 
 the foes at hand , or from afar distress 
 to drive ‘ em headlong downward , and to pour 
 on their descending backs a stony show'r

a night , where darkness lays her chains and bars 
 and feral fires appear instead of stars 
 but he , along with the last looks of day 
 went hence , and setting — sunlike — pass 'd away

 they seem to mutter oer their songs in fear 
 and , climb we eer so soft the spinney rails 
 all stops as if no bird was anywhere 
 the kindled bushes with the young leaves thin

 until impatience cannot see or hear 
 the hidden music ; gets but little way 
 upon the path — when up the songs begin 
 full loud a moment and then low again 
 but when a day or two confirms her stay 
 boldly she sings and loud for half the day 
 and soon the village brings the woodman 's tale 
 of having heard the newcome nightingale

nat started the bowling ( and take my word , misters 
 there 's no bowling like it for underhand twisters 
 and what with the pace and the screw and the aim 
 it was pretty hard work , was that blunderby game 
 with nat in the field to look after the ball 
 ‘ twas a terrible struggle to get runs at all 
 though they hit out their hardest a regular stunner 
 ‘ twas rare that it reckoned for more than a oner 
 ‘ twas seldom indeed that they troubled the scorer 
 to put down a twoer , a threer , or fourer 
 and as for a lost ball , a fiver , or sixer 
 the blunderby boys were not up to the trick , sir 
 still they struggled full well , and at sixty the score 
 the last wicket fell , and the innings was o'er 

when winds that move not its calm surface sweep 
 the azure sea , i love the land no more 
 the smiles of the serene and tranquil deep 
 tempt my unquiet mind .— but when the roar 
 of ocean 's gray abyss resounds , and foam 
 gathers upon the sea , and vast waves burst 
 i turn from the drear aspect to the home 
 of earth and its deep woods , where , interspersed 
 when winds blow loud , pines make sweet melody 
 whose house is some lone bark , whose toil the sea 
 whose prey the wandering fish , an evil lot 
 has chosen .— but i my languid limbs will fling 
 beneath the plane , where the brook 's murmuring 
 moves the calm spirit , but disturbs it not

‘ tis said , for forty days the spectre stayed 
 for forty days the knight incessant prayed 
 with scourge , with vigil and ascetic rite 
 with fast , with groan remorseful and contrite 
 he cleansed his blackened spirit by degrees 
 and purified it from its vanities 
 and as he prayed , the spectre 's gruesome scowl 
 grew day by day less hideous and foul 
 as he waxed holy , it became more bright 
 and after forty days , arrayed in white 
 it spread its spotless arms , devoid of taint 
 above this erstwhile knight and henceforth saint 
 in benediction , as he knelt in prayer 
 then vanished instantly to empty air 

the increasing moonlight drifts across my bed 
 and on the church yard by the road , i know 
 it falls as white and noiselessly as snow

 where the swift currents of the river flow

 a signal rocket pierces the dense night 
 flings its spent stars upon the town beneath 
 hark ! the artillery massing on the right 
 hark ! the black squadrons wheeling down to death 

o thou who dost know what the heart fain would hide 
 who ever art ready whate'er may betide

 whose ears with the groans of the wretched are plied

 all good is assembled where thou dost abide

 and of thee all my poverty 's wants are supplied 
 what choice have i save to thy portal to go 
 if ‘ tis shut , to what other my steps can i guide

 thy bounty and kindness are not the less wide 

despise the garish presences that flaunt 
 the obvious possession of today 
 to wear with me the spectacles that haunt 
 the optic sense with wraiths of yesterday 
 these cobbled shores through which the traffic streams 
 have been the stage set of successive towns 
 where coffined actors postured out their dreams 
 and harlot folly changed her thousand gowns 
 this corner shop was bull 's head tavern

 bound nine times round with hell 's most dolorous flow 
 and in its pools thy crownless head lie low 
 by his of spain who dared an english queen 
 with half a world to hearten him for fight

 of all the world , and florisht most in might

o sugared talk , wherewith my thoughts do live 
 o brows , love 's trophy and my senses ’ shine 
 o charming smiles , that death or life can give 
 o heavenly kisses from a mouth divine 
 o wreaths too strong , and trammels made of hair 
 o pearls inclos è d in an ebon pale 
 o rose and lilies in a field most fair 
 where modest white doth make the red seem pale 
 o voice whose accents live within my heart 
 o heavenly hand that more than atlas holds 
 o sighs perfumed , that can release my smart 
 o happy they whom in her arms she folds 
 now if you ask where dwelleth all this bliss

into a stately dwelling dark and old 
 a woman glides with troubled , weary air 
 her face is pale , her hands are white and cold 
 the silken hood falls from her loosened hair 
 she heeds it not , but listlessly stands 
 with thoughtful eyes and tightly folded hands 
 at last the maid with noiseless step draws near 
 removes her wraps and in her listening ear 
 speaks these few words : “ in passing through the crowd 
 to night , a man of face and manner proud 
 this missive gave to me . i looked around 
 for one brief moment his face upon me frowned 
 then he was gone , and though i scanned the street 
 his form again my glances did not meet 

me my own fate to lasting sorrow doometh 
 thy woes are birds of passage , transitory 
 thy spirit , circled with a living glory 
 in summer still a summer joy resumeth 
 alone my hopeless melancholy gloometh 
 like a lone cypress , through the twilight hoary 
 from an old garden where no flower bloometh 
 one cypress on an inland promontory 
 but yet my lonely spirit follows thine 
 as round the rolling earth night follows day 
 but yet thy lights on my horizon shine 
 into my night when thou art far away 
 i am so dark , alas ! and thou so bright 
 when we two meet there 's never perfect light 

above the ruin of god 's holy place 
 where man forsaken lay the bleeding rood 
 whose hands , when men had craved substantial food 
 gave not , nor folded when they cried , embrace 
 i saw exalted in the latter days 
 her whom west winds with natal foam bedewed 
 wafted toward cyprus , lily breasted , nude 
 standing with arms out stretched and flower like face 
 and , sick with all those centuries of tears 
 shed in the penance for factitious woe 
 once more i saw the nations at her feet 
 for love shone in their eyes , and in their ears 
 come unto me , love beckoned them , for lo 
 the breast your lips abjured is still as sweet 

‘ what had i lost , if , conjugally kind 
 by nature hating , yet by vows confined 
 untaught the matrimonial bonds to slight 
 and coldly conscious of a husband 's right 
 you had faint drawn me with a form alone 
 a lawful lump of life by force your own 
 then , while your backward will retrenched desire 
 and unconcurring spirits lent no fire 
 i had been born your dull , domestic heir 
 load of your life , and motive of your care 
 perhaps been poorly rich , and meanly great 
 the slave of pomp , a cipher in the state 
 lordly neglectful of a worth unknown 
 and slumbering in a seat by chance my own 

with snow white veil and garments as of flame 
 she stands before thee , who so long ago 
 filled thy young heart with passion and the woe 
 from which thy song and all its splendors came 
 and while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name 
 the ice about thy heart melts as the snow 
 on mountain height ; and in swift overflow 
 comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame 
 thou makest full confession ; and a gleam 
 as of the dawn on some dark forest cast 
 seems on thy lifted forehead to increase 
 lethe and eunoe — the remembered dream 
 and the forgotten sorrow — bring at last 
 that perfect pardon which is perfect peace 

i know , indeed , that sons of thine have died 
 in lissa 's waters , by the mountain side 
 of aspromonte , on novara 's plain 
 nor have thy children died for thee in vain 
 and yet , methinks , thou hast not drunk this wine 
 from grapes new crushed of liberty divine 
 thou hast not followed that immortal star 
 which leads the people forth to deeds of war 
 weary of life , thou liest in silent sleep 
 as one who marks the lengthening shadows creep 
 careless of all the hurrying hours that run 
 mourning some day of glory , for the sun 
 of freedom hath not shewn to thee his face 
 and thou hast caught no flambeau in the race 

well can i recall that eve at sligo 
 and the vacant arches of the abbey 
 framing the ethereal rose of sunset 
 round about me silence and gray shadow 
 peopled with the wraiths of time departed 
 monks with back thrown cowls who pace the cloisters 
 now deep mounded , crumbled , clad with ivy 
 no more from the tower their chimes of silver 
 will the bells fling o'er the town and river 
 o'er the garavogue soft gliding seaward 
 nevermore — save in deep dreams at midnight 
 death , the immemorial lord of mortals 
 he is abbot in the aisles of sligo 
 till the spheres proclaim the resurrection 

ye heralds of my heart , mine ardent groans 
 o tears which gladly would burst out to brooks 
 oh spent on fruitless sand my surging moans 
 oh thoughts enthralled unto care boding looks 
 ah just laments of my unjust distress 
 ah fond desires whom reason could not guide 
 oh hopes of love that intimate redress 
 yet prove the load stars unto bad betide 
 when will you cease ? or shall pain never ceasing 
 seize oh my heart ? oh mollify your rage 
 lest your assaults with over swift increasing 
 procure my death , or call on timeless age 
 what if they do ? they shall but feed the fire 
 which i have kindled by my fond desire 

o night and death , to whom we grudged him then 
 when in man 's sight he stood not yet undone 
 your king , your priest , your saviour , and your son 
 we grudge not now , who know that not again 
 shall this curse come upon the sins of men 
 nor this face look upon the living sun 
 that shall behold not so abhorred an one 
 in all the days whereof his eye takes ken 
 the bond is cancelled , and the prayer is heard 
 that seemed so long but weak and wasted breath 
 take him , for he is yours , o night and death 
 hell yawns on him whose life was as a word 
 uttered by death in hate of heaven and light 
 a curse now dumb upon the lips of night 

it is not , y ’ are deceav 'd , it is not blisse 
 what you conceave a happy living is 
 to have your hands with rubies bright to glow 
 then on your tortoise bed your body throw 
 and sink your self in down , to drink in gold 
 and have your looser self in purple roll 'd 
 with royal fare to make the tables groan 
 or else with what from lybick fields is mown 
 nor in one vault hoard all your magazine 
 but at no cowards fate t ’ have frighted bin 
 nor with the peoples breath to be swol'n great 
 nor at a drawn stiletto basely swear 
 he that dares this , nothing to him 's unfit 
 but proud o ’ th ’ top of fortunes wheel may sit 

next , ripe in yellow gold , a vineyard shines 
 bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines 
 a deeper dye the dangling clusters show 
 and curl ’ d on silver props , in order glow 
 a darker metal mix ’ d intrench ’ d the place 
 and pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace 
 to this , one pathway gently winding leads 
 where march a train with baskets on their heads 
 ( fair maids and blooming youths ,) that smiling bear 
 the purple product of the autumnal year 
 to these a youth awakes the warbling strings 
 whose tender lay the fate of linus sings 
 in measured dance behind him move the train 
 tune soft the voice , and answer to the strain 

lift up thy light on us and on thine own 
 o soul whose spirit on earth was as a rod 
 to scourge off priests , a sword to pierce their god 
 a staff for man 's free thought to walk alone 
 a lamp to lead him far from shrine and throne 
 on ways untrodden where his fathers trod 
 ere earth 's heart withered at a high priest 's nod 
 and all men 's mouths that made not prayer made moan 
 from bonds and torments and the ravening flame 
 surely thy spirit of sense rose up to greet 
 lucretius , where such only spirits meet 
 and walk with him apart till shelley came 
 to make the heaven of heavens more heavenly sweet 
 and mix with yours a third incorporate name 

“ hear , every trojan , lycian , dardan band

 in vain they skulk behind their boasted wall 
 weak bulwarks ; destined by this arm to fall

wilt thou love god as he thee ? then digest 
 my soul ! this wholesome meditation 
 how god the spirit , by angels waited on 
 in heaven , doth make his temple in thy breast 
 the father having begot a son most blest 
 and still begetting , ( for he ne'er begun 
 hath deigned to choose thee by adoption 
 co heir to his glory , and sabbath 's endless rest 
 and as a robbed man , which by search doth find 
 his stol'n stuff sold , must lose or buy ‘ t again 
 the sun of glory came down and was slain 
 us , whom he had made , and satan stole , to unbind 
 ‘ twas much that man was made like god before 
 but that god should be made like man much more 

round the rich throne , in various lustre dight 
 gems undistinguished cast a changing light 
 sapphire and emerald soften down the scene 
 cold azure mingling with the vernal green 
 pearl , amber , ruby warmer flames unfold 
 and diamonds brighten from the burning gold 
 thro all the dome the living blazes blend 
 and shoot their rainbows where the arches bend 
 on every ceiling , painted light and gay 
 symbolic forms their graphic art display 
 recording , confident of endless fame 
 each feat of arms , each patriarchal name 
 like memphian hieroglyphs , to stretch the span 
 of memory frail in momentary man 

sudden , while olive gazed , she thought a flame 
 sprang from her feet , when looking , startled , down 
 she saw the glory of the rising sun 
 touching the pinnacle of sparkling ice 
 on which she stood . silent and rapt she gazed 
 while thousand golden flames on thousand spires 
 were low and lower lit ; and here and there 
 some broad plain glimmered into sudden white 
 and frozen cataracts which , in daring leaps 
 midway between vast depths were holden tight 
 gleamed out like streams of gold :— thus , one by one 
 the wonders of that soulless land appeared 
 while grey and ghast , behind the sparkling towers 
 of gorgeous thug , the ancient night stooped down 

that time of year thou mayst in me behold 
 when yellow leaves , or none , or few do hang 
 upon those boughs which shake against the cold 
 bare ruined choirs , where late the sweet birds sang 
 in me thou seest the twilight of such day 
 as after sunset fadeth in the west 
 which by and by black night doth take away 
 death 's second self that seals up all in rest 
 in me thou seest the glowing of such fire 
 that on the ashes of his youth doth lie 
 as the death bed , whereon it must expire 
 consumed with that which it was nourished by 
 this thou perceiv'st , which makes thy love more strong 
 to love that well , which thou must leave ere long 

here learning , too , shall rear unnumbered domes 
 here shakspeares — tassos — find more happy homes 
 here homer 's fire , and virgil 's polished grace 
 a sacred charm shall give to many a place 
 each shady hill shall be a muse 's haunt 
 by each pure spring aerial nymphs shall chant 
 chant the sweet song to heavenly liberty 
 while thundering cataracts peal it to the sea 
 she spake no more ;— or i too much opprest 
 by wondrous visions , needed welcome rest 
 and when i waked , the day had now unfurled 
 his rosy banners o'er the laughing world 
 and while the glorious prospect charmed my view 
 i felt columbia 's prophecy was true 

her gay descent the man perceived afar 
 wondering he ran to catch the falling star 
 but so surprised , as none but he can tell 
 who loved so quickly , and who loved so well 
 o'er all his veins the wandering passion burns 
 he calls her nymph , and every nymph by turns 
 her form to lovely venus he prefers 
 or swears that venus must be such as hers 
 she , proud to rule , yet strangely framed to tease 
 neglects his offers while her airs she plays 
 shoots scornful glances from the bended frown 
 in brisk disorder trips it up and down 
 then hums a careless tune to lay the storm 
 and sits and blushes , smiles , and yields in form 

happy is england ! i could be content 
 to see no other verdure than its own 
 to feel no other breezes than are blown 
 through its tall woods with high romances blent 
 yet do i sometimes feel a languishment 
 for skies italian , and an inward groan 
 to sit upon an alp as on a throne 
 and half forget what world or worldling meant 
 happy is england , sweet her artless daughters 
 enough their simple loveliness for me 
 enough their whitest arms in silence clinging 
 yet do i often warmly burn to see 
 beauties of deeper glance , and hear their singing 
 and float with them about the summer waters 

for if alone thou think to waft my love 
 her cold is such as can the sea command 
 and frozen ice shall let thy boat to move 
 nor can thy forces row it from the land 
 but if thou friendly both at once shalt take 
 thyself mayst rest . for why ? my sighs will blow 
 our cold and heat so sweet a thaw shall make 
 as that thy boat without thy help shall row 
 then will i sit and glut me on those eyes 
 wherewith my life my eyes could never fill 
 thus from my boat that comfort shall arise 
 the want whereof my life and hope did kill 
 together placed so thou her scorn shalt cross 
 where if we part thy boat must suffer loss 

the knave of diamonds tries his wily arts 
 and wins ( oh shameful chance !) the queen of hearts 
 at this , the blood the virgin 's cheek forsook 
 a livid paleness spreads o'er all her look 
 she sees , and trembles at th ’ approaching ill 
 just in the jaws of ruin , and codille 
 and now ( as oft in some distemper 'd state 
 on one nice trick depends the gen'ral fate 
 an ace of hearts steps forth : the king unseen 
 lurk 'd in her hand , and mourn 'd his captive queen 
 he springs to vengeance with an eager pace 
 and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace 
 the nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky 
 the walls , the woods , and long canals reply 

if in this storm of joy and pompous throng 
 this nymph ( great king ) doth come to thee so near 
 that thy harmonious ears her accents hear 
 give pardon to her hoarse and lowly song 
 fain would she trophies to thy virtues rear 
 but for this stately task she is not strong 
 and her defects her high attempts do wrong 
 yet as she could she makes thy worth appear 
 so in a map is shown this flowery place 
 so wrought in arras by a virgin 's hand 
 with heaven and blazing stars doth atlas stand 
 so drawn by charcoal is narcissus ’ face 
 she like the morn may be to some bright sun 
 the day to perfect that 's by her begun 

when i do think my meanest line shall be 
 more in time ’ s use than my creating whole 
 that future eyes more clearly shall feel me 
 in this inked page than in my direct soul 
 when i conjecture put to make me seeing 
 good readers of me in some aftertime 
 thankful to some idea of my being 
 that doth not even my with gone true soul rime 
 an anger at the essence of the world 
 that makes this thus , or thinkable this wise 
 takes my soul by the throat and makes it hurled 
 in nightly horrors of despaired surmise 
 and i become the mere sense of a rage 
 that lacks the very words whose waste might ’ suage 

dear , though from me your gratious looks depart 
 and of that comfort do myself bereave 
 which both i did deserve and did receive 
 triumph not over much in this my smart 
 nay , rather they which now enjoy thy heart 
 for fear just cause of mourning should conceive 
 lest thou inconstant shouldst their trust deceive 
 which like unto the weather changing art 
 for in foul weather birds sing often will 
 in hope of fair , and in fair time will cease 
 for fear fair time should not continue still 
 so they may mourn which have thy heart possessed 
 for fear of change , and hope of change may ease 
 their hearts whom grief of change doth now molest 

i heard in my slumbers the ceaseless roar 
 of the sparkling waves , as they met the shore 
 till lulled by the surge of the moon lit deep 
 by the heaving ocean i sank to sleep 
 and a magic spell on my spirit was cast 
 and forms that had perished in ages past 
 were by fancy revealed to my wondering view 
 as the veil of oblivion she backward drew 
 and showed me a glorious vision , dressed 
 in the rosy light of the glowing west 
 such colours at parting the day god throws 
 to gild his path , as rejoicing he goes 
 like a victor red with the spoils of fight 
 to raise through darkness the banner of light 

“ not so , eurymachus : that no man draws 
 the wondrous bow , attend another cause 
 sacred to phoebus is the solemn day 
 which thoughtless we in games would waste away 
 till the next dawn this ill timed strife forego 
 and here leave fixed the ringlets in a row 
 now bid the sewer approach , and let us join 
 in due libations , and in rites divine 
 so end our night : before the day shall spring 
 the choicest offerings let melanthius bring

he should have followed who goes forth before us 
 last born of us in life , in death first born 
 the last to lift up eyes against the morn 
 the first to see the sunset . life , that bore us 
 perchance for death to comfort and restore us 
 of him hath left us here awhile forlorn 
 for him is as a garment overworn 
 and time and change , with suns and stars in chorus 
 silent . but if , beyond all change or time 
 a law more just , more equal , more sublime 
 than sways the surge of life 's loud sterile sea 
 sways that still world whose peace environs him 
 where death lies dead as night when stars wax dim

the husband quite astonished now appeared 
 at once a hundred diff'rent ills he feared 
 but questioning his wife howe'er , he found 
 that many other dames who lived around 
 like her ; in paying tithes , the monks obeyed 
 which consolation to his breast conveyed 
 poor innocent ! she nothing wished to hide

here pock marked black beard covenanted bonnet 
 to slit the dons ’ throats at st. augustine 
 and bussed light ladies , unknown to this sonnet 
 whose names , no doubt , would rime with magdalene 
 and english parsons , who had lost their fames 
 sat tippling wine as spicy as their joke 
 larding bald texts with bets on cocking mains 
 and whiffing pipes churchwardens used to smoke 
 here macaronis , hands a droop with laces 
 dealt knave to knave in picquet or é cart é, 
 in coats no whit less scarlet than their faces 
 while bullies hiccuped healths to king and party 
 and yankee slavers , in from barbadoes 
 drove flinty bargains with keen huguenots 

what would they fail in courtesy to me 
 of that strange non compliance , what the cause 
 it might produce in me mistrustful thoughts 
 let josabet , or joad , i tell you , bring them 
 i can , when time requires , speak like a queen 
 abner , to you i may indeed declare 
 your priests have reason to be satisfied 
 with athaliah 's kindness . still i know 
 that on my conduct and against my power 
 how far they bear the license of their speech 
 they live , however , and their temple stands 
 but soon , i feel , my gentleness must end 
 let joad put bridle on his savage zeal 
 nor wound me with a second outrage . go 

i never gave a lock of hair away 
 to a man , dearest , except this to thee 
 which now upon my fingers thoughtfully 
 i ring out to the full brown length and say 
 “ take it . ” my day of youth went yesterday 
 my hair no longer bounds to my foot 's glee 
 nor plant i it from rose or myrtle tree 
 as girls do , any more : it only may 
 now shade on two pale cheeks the mark of tears 
 taught drooping from the head that hangs aside 
 through sorrow 's trick . i thought the funeral shears 
 would take this first , but love is justified 
 take it thou ,— finding pure , from all those years 
 the kiss my mother left here when she died 

with nothing to wear , if the climate is suiting 
 we might get along i am sure pretty well 
 no washing and starching and crimping and fluting 
 no muslin and laces and trouble of dressing , they tell 
 e'er troubles the women , or bothers the men 
 who soon grow accustomed , as people do here 
 to fashions prevailing , and things that they ken 
 to dresses fore shortened where bosoms appear 
 to bonnets that show but a rose in the wearing 
 to dresses that sweep like a besom the street 
 to dresses so gauzy the hoops through are seen 
 to shoes quite as gauzy to cover the feet 
 but watch how a man here goes raving and swearing 
 at wife and all hands , if they 've nothing to eat 

what human form is this ? what form divine 
 and who are these that gaze upon his face 
 mild , beautiful , and full of heavenly grace 
 with whose reflected light the gazers shine 
 saviour , who does not know it to be thine 
 who does not long to fill a gazer 's place 
 and yet there is no time , there is no space 
 to keep away thy servants from thy shrine 
 here if we kneel , and watch with faithful eyes 
 thou art not too far for faithful eyes to see 
 thou art not too far to turn and look on me 
 to speak to me , and to receive my sighs 
 therefore for ever i forget the skies 
 and find an everlasting sun in thee 

cherish you then the hope i shall forget 
 at length , my lord , pieria ?— put away 
 for your so passing sake , this mouth of clay 
 these mortal bones against my body set 
 for all the puny fever and frail sweat 
 of human love ,— renounce for these , i say 
 the singing mountain 's memory , and betray 
 the silent lyre that hangs upon me yet 
 ah , but indeed , some day shall you awake 
 rather , from dreams of me , that at your side 
 so many nights , a lover and a bride 
 but stern in my soul 's chastity , have lain 
 to walk the world forever for my sake 
 and in each chamber find me gone again 

stranger than any book i 've ever read 
 here on the reeking battlefield i lie 
 under the stars , propped up with smeary dead 
 like too , if no one takes me in , to die 
 hit on the arms , legs , liver , lungs and gall 
 damn glad there 's nothing more of me to hit 
 but calm , and feeling never pain at all 
 and full of wonder at the turn of it 
 for of the dead around me three are mine 
 three foemen vanquished in the whirl of fight 
 so if i die i have no right to whine 
 i feel i 've done my little bit all right 
 i do n't know how — but there the beggars are 
 as dead as herrings pickled in a jar 

here cocks heroic burn with rival rage 
 and quails with quails in doubtful fight engage 
 of armed heels and bristling plumage proud 
 they sound the insulting clarion shrill and loud 
 with rustling pinions meet , and swelling chests 
 and seize with closing beaks their bleeding crests 
 rise on quick wing above the struggling foe 
 and aim in air the death devoting blow 
 there the hoarse stag his croaking rival scorns 
 and butts and parries with his branching horns 
 contending boars with tusk enamell 'd strike 
 and guard with shoulder shield the blow oblique 
 while female bands attend in mute surprise 
 and view the victor with admiring eyes 

whilst i alone did call upon thy aid 
 my verse alone had all thy gentle grace 
 but now my gracious numbers are decayed 
 and my sick muse doth give an other place 
 i grant ( sweet love ) thy lovely argument 
 deserves the travail of a worthier pen 
 yet what of thee thy poet doth invent 
 he robs thee of , and pays it thee again 
 he lends thee virtue , and he stole that word 
 from thy behaviour , beauty doth he give 
 and found it in thy cheek : he can afford 
 no praise to thee , but what in thee doth live 
 then thank him not for that which he doth say 
 since what he owes thee , thou thy self dost pay 

seductive waltz !— though on thy native shore 
 even werter 's self proclaim 'd thee half a whore 
 werter — to decent vice though much inclined 
 yet warm , not wanton ; dazzled , but not blind 
 though gentle genlis , in her strife with sta ë l 
 would even proscribe thee from a paris ball 
 the fashion hails — from countesses to queens 
 and maids and valets waltz behind the scenes 
 wide and more wide thy witching circle spreads 
 and turns — if nothing else — at least our heads 
 with thee even clumsy cits attempt to bounce 
 and cockneys practise what they can n't pronounce 
 gods ! how the glorious theme my strain exalts 
 and rhyme finds partner rhyme in praise of “ waltz 

sweet cytherea , sitting by a brook 
 with young adonis , lovely , fresh , and green 
 did court the lad with many a lovely look 
 such looks as none could look but beauty 's queen 
 she told him stories to delight his ear 
 she show 'd him favours to allure his eye 
 to win his heart , she touch 'd him here and there 
 touches so soft still conquer chastity 
 but whether unripe years did want conceit 
 or he refused to take her figured proffer 
 the tender nibbler would not touch the bait 
 but smile and jest at every gentle offer 
 then fell she on her back , fair queen , and toward 
 he rose and ran away ; ah , fool too froward 

gehazi by the hue that chills thy cheek 
 and pilate by the hue that sears thine hand 
 whence all earth 's waters cannot wash the brand 
 that signs thy soul a manslayer 's though thou speak 
 all christ , with lips most murderous and most meek 
 thou set thy foot where england 's used to stand 
 thou reach thy rod forth over indian land 
 slave of the slaves that call thee lord , and weak 
 as their foul tongues who praise thee ! son of them 
 whose presence put the snows and stars to shame 
 in centuries dead and damned that reek below 
 curse consecrated , crowned with crime and flame 
 to them that bare thee like them shalt thou go 
 forth of man 's life — a leper white as snow 

and there i found him whom i went to find 
 a man of noble make and head uplift 
 of equal carriage , nature 's bounteous gift 
 for in no shelter had his generous mind 
 grown flowers that need the winds , rough not unkind 
 the joiner 's bench taught him , with judgment swift 
 seen things to fashion , unseen things to sift 
 from all his face a living soul outshined 
 telling of strength and inward quietude 
 his great hand shook mine greatly , and his eyes 
 looked straight in mine with spiritual replies 
 i left him , rich with overflowing good 
 such joys within two hours of happy mood 
 met me beneath the everlasting skies 

meanwhile , however , while thus the lady sought 
 by ev'ry charm to please , a note was brought 
 a page conveyed it , by the marquis sent 
 to say his coming business would prevent 
 the disappointment doubtless was severe 
 but consolation certainly was near 
 it proved to reynold wonderfully kind 
 for scarcely had our traveller resigned 
 and groaned aloud , but , tender as her dame 
 in haste the confidential servant came 
 and to the widow said :— i hear below 
 some poor unfortunate o'ercome with woe 
 ‘ tis piercing cold , and he perhaps will die 
 some place , pray grant , where he to night may lie 

methought i saw the footsteps of a throne 
 which mists and vapours from mine eyes did shroud 
 nor view of him who sate thereon allow 'd 
 but all the steps and ground about were strown 
 with sights the ruefullest that flesh and bone 
 ever put on ; a miserable crowd 
 sick , hale , old , young , who cried before that cloud 
 “ thou art our king , o death ! to thee we groan 
 i seem 'd to mount those steps ; the vapours gave 
 smooth way ; and i beheld the face of one 
 sleeping alone within a mossy cave 
 with her face up to heaven ; that seem 'd to have 
 pleasing remembrance of a thought foregone 
 a lovely beauty in a summer grave 

the man for wisdom 's various arts renown 'd 
 long exercised in woes , o muse ! resound 
 who , when his arms had wrought the destined fall 
 of sacred troy , and razed her heaven built wall 
 wandering from clime to clime , observant stray 'd 
 their manners noted , and their states survey 'd 
 on stormy seas unnumber 'd toils he bore 
 safe with his friends to gain his natal shore 
 vain toils ! their impious folly dared to prey 
 on herds devoted to the god of day 
 the god vindictive doom 'd them never more 
 ( ah , men unbless 'd !) to touch that natal shore 
 oh , snatch some portion of these acts from fate 
 celestial muse ! and to our world relate 

the prizes next are order ’ d to the field 
 for the bold champions who the caestus wield 
 a stately mule , as yet by toils unbroke 
 of six years ’ age , unconscious of the yoke 
 is to the circus led , and firmly bound 
 next stands a goblet , massy , large , and round 
 achilles rising , thus : “ let greece excite 
 two heroes equal to this hardy fight 
 who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke 
 and rush beneath the long descending stroke 
 on whom apollo shall the palm bestow 
 and whom the greeks supreme by conquest know 
 this mule his dauntless labours shall repay 
 the vanquish ’ d bear the massy bowl away 

“ o jove ( he cried ) o all ye powers above 
 see the lewd dalliance of the queen of love 
 me , awkward me , she scorns ; and yields her charms 
 to that fair lecher , the strong god of arms 
 if i am lame , that stain my natal hour 
 by fate imposed ; such me my parent bore 
 why was i born ? see how the wanton lies 
 oh sight tormenting to a husband 's eyes 
 but yet , i trust , this once e'en mars would fly 
 his fair one 's arms — he thinks her , once , too nigh 
 but there remain , ye guilty , in my power 
 till jove refunds his shameless daughter 's dower 
 too dear i prized a fair enchanting face

when autumn suns are soft , and sea winds moan 
 and golden fruits make sweet the golden air 
 in gardens where the apple blossoms were 
 in these old springs before i walked alone 
 i pass among the pathways overgrown 
 of all the former flowers that kissed your feet 
 remains a poppy , pallid from the heat 
 a wild poppy that the wild winds have sown 
 alas ! the rose forgets your hands of rose 
 the lilies slumber in the lily bed 
 ‘ tis only poppies in the dreamy close 
 the changeless , windless garden of the dead 
 you tend , with buds soft as your kiss that lies 
 in over happy dreams , upon mine eyes 

army reserve ; a worshipper of bobs 
 with whom he stripped the smock from candahar 
 neat as his mount , that neatest among cobs 
 whenever pageants pass , or meetings are 
 he moves conspicuous , vigilant , severe 
 with his light cavalry hand and seat and look 
 a living type of order , in whose sphere 
 is room for neither hooligan nor hook 
 for in his shadow , wheresoe'er he ride 
 paces , all eye and hardihood and grip 
 the dreaded crusher , might in his every stride 
 and right materialized girt at his hip 
 and they , that shake to see these twain go by 
 feel that the tec , that plain clothes terror , is nigh 

a hilltop sought by every soothing breeze 
 that loves the melody of murmuring boughs 
 cool shades , green acreage , and antique house 
 fronting the ocean and the dawn ; than these 
 old monks built never for the spirit 's ease 
 cloisters more calm — not cluny nor clairvaux 
 sweet are the noises from the bay below 
 and cuckoos calling in the tulip trees 
 here , a yet empty suitor in thy train 
 beloved poesy , great joy was mine 
 to while a listless spell of summer days 
 happier than hoarder in each evening 's gain 
 when evenings found me richer by one line 
 one verse well turned , or serviceable phrase 

she entered as the holy monk desired 
 and they together to his cell retired 
 the friar on the bed this maiden threw 
 a kiss would take :— she from him rather drew 
 and said .— to give one wit is this the way 
 yes , answered he , and round her ‘ gan to play 
 upon her bosom then he put his hand 
 what now , said she , am i to understand 
 is this the way ?— said he , ‘ tis so decreed 
 then patiently she let the monk proceed 
 who followed up , from point to point , his aim 
 and wit , by easy steps , advancing came 
 till its progression with her was complete 
 then alice laughed , success appeared so sweet 

when night first spread her curtain o'er the deep 
 firm based beneath the waves the lighthouse tower 
 rose to the clouds , and mariners once more 
 blest the bright gleam that o'er them ward would keep 
 when rose the moon , the sea lay all asleep 
 it 's dreaming waves enfolded by the shore 
 and founded on the rock , of iron its door 
 the beacon flashed its light across the deep 
 then rose the storm and lashed the waves until 
 they roared like wounded lions , and there raved 
 the elemental forces , shock on shock 
 and all the great sea 's batteries worked their will 
 that never more should ship through it be saved 
 the rising sun looked out and saw — the rock 

voice of the holy spirit , making known 
 man to himself , a witness swift and sure 
 warning , approving , true and wise and pure 
 counsel and guidance that misleadeth none 
 by thee the mystery of life is read 
 the picture writing of the world 's gray seers 
 the myths and parables of the primal years 
 whose letter kills , by thee interpreted 
 take healthful meanings fitted to our needs 
 and in the soul 's vernacular express 
 the common law of simple righteousness 
 hatred of cant and doubt of human creeds 
 may well be felt : the unpardonable sin 
 is to deny the word of god within 

in loving thee thou know'st i am forsworn 
 but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing 
 in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn 
 in vowing new hate after new love bearing 
 but why of two oaths ’ breach do i accuse thee 
 when i break twenty ? i am perjured most 
 for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee 
 and all my honest faith in thee is lost 
 for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness 
 oaths of thy love , thy truth , thy constancy 
 and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness 
 or made them swear against the thing they see 
 for i have sworn thee fair : more perjured i 
 to swear against the truth so foul a be 

when our two souls stand up erect and strong 
 face to face , silent , drawing nigh and nigher 
 until the lengthening wings break into fire 
 at either curved point ,— what bitter wrong 
 can the earth do to us , that we should not long 
 be here contented ? think ! in mounting higher 
 the angels would press on us and aspire 
 to drop some golden orb of perfect song 
 into our deep , dear silence . let us stay 
 rather on earth , beloved ,— where the unfit 
 contrarious moods of men recoil away 
 and isolate pure spirits , and permit 
 a place to stand and love in for a day 
 with darkness and the death hour rounding it 

i served my sentence — a bitter pill 
 some fellows should take who never will 
 and then i decided to go “ out west 
 concludin ’ ‘ twould suit my health the best 
 where , how i prospered , i never could tell 
 but fortune seemed to like me well 
 an ’ somehow every vein i struck 
 was always bubbling over with luck 
 an ’ , better than that , i was steady an ’ true 
 an ’ put my good resolutions through 
 but i wrote to a trusty old neighbor , an ’ said 
 “ you tell ‘ em , old fellow , that i am dead 
 an ’ died a christian ; ‘ twill please ‘ em more 
 than if i had lived the same as before 

if e'er the sacred poem that hath made 
 both heav'n and earth copartners in its toil 
 and with lean abstinence , through many a year 
 faded my brow , be destin 'd to prevail 
 over the cruelty , which bars me forth 
 of the fair sheep fold , where a sleeping lamb 
 the wolves set on and fain had worried me 
 with other voice and fleece of other grain 
 i shall forthwith return , and , standing up 
 at my baptismal font , shall claim the wreath 
 due to the poet 's temples : for i there 
 first enter 'd on the faith which maketh souls 
 acceptable to god : and , for its sake 
 peter had then circled my forehead thus 

aye , you may see their graves — you who have toiled 
 and tripped and thirsted , like these men of ours 
 for , verily , i say that not so deep 
 their bones are that the scattered drift and dust 
 of gusty days will never leave them bare 
 o dear , dead , bleaching bones ! i know of those 
 who have the wild , strong will to go and sit 
 outside all things with you , and keep the ways 
 aloof from bats , and snakes , and trampling feet 
 that smite your peace and theirs — who have the heart 
 without the lusty limbs , to face the fire 
 and moonless midnights , and to be , indeed 
 for very sorrow , like a moaning wind 
 in wintry forests with perpetual rain 

like as the lute delights or else dislikes 
 as is his art that plays upon the same 
 so sounds my muse according as she strikes 
 on my heart strings high tuned unto her fame 
 her touch doth cause the warble of the sound 
 which here i yield in lamentable wise 
 a wailing descant on the sweetest ground 
 whose due reports give honour to her eyes 
 else harsh my style , untunable my muse 
 hoarse sounds the voice that praiseth not her name 
 if any pleasing relish here i use 
 then judge the world her beauty gives the same 
 for no ground else could make the music such 
 nor other hand could give so sweet a touch

 as the poor pheasant , with his peaceful mien 
 trusts to his feathers , shining golden green 
 when the dark plumage with the crimson beak 
 has rustled shadowy from its splintered peak 
 so trust thy friends , whose babbling tongues would charm 
 the lifted sabre from thy foeman 's arm 
 thy torches ready for the answering peal 
 from bellowing fort and thunder freighted keel 

when old jack died , it seemed a human friend 
 had suddenly gone from us ; that some face 
 that we had loved to fondle and embrace 
 from babyhood , no more would condescend 
 to smile on us forever . we might bend 
 with tearful eyes above him , interlace 
 our chubby fingers o'er him , romp and race 
 plead with him , call and coax — aye , we might send 
 the old halloo up for him , whistle , hist 
 ( if sobs had let us ) or , as wildly vain 
 snapped thumbs , called “ speak , ” and he had not replied 
 we might have gone down on our knees and kissed 
 the tousled ears , and yet they must remain 
 deaf , motionless , we knew — when old jack died 

thus having spoke , the unknown celestial leads 
 the footsteps of the duty he treads 
 and secret moves along the crowded space 
 unseen of all the rude phaeacian race

 the spreading harbours , and the riding fleets

 in separate islands , crown 'd with rising spires

 by mere reflecting solid life destroying

 it must not think , doth further from joy move 

pleased with our gay disports , the dame was wont

he spoke , and bade the sad attendants round 
 cleanse the pale corse , and wash each honour ’ d wound

upon the steps a woman stands — alone 
 her lovely face , a trifle paler grown 
 since last we looked upon its haunting grace 
 yet still the same child mouth , the radiant eyes 
 the dauntless pride , that time cannot efface 
 before her gazes the earth in beauty lies 
 awhile she stands and gaze on the scene 
 with dreamy , far off looks and thoughtful mien 
 then wends her way to where the flowers lie 
 she lingers here , she cannot pass them by 
 and as she bends to touch each smiling flower 
 her hands seem gifted with a magic power 
 that draws unto herself their clinging love 
 as human tendrils drawn to god above

the snow falls deep ; the forest lies alone 
 the boy goes hasty for his load of brakes 
 then thinks upon the fire and hurries back 
 the gipsy knocks his hands and tucks them up 
 and seeks his squalid camp , half hid in snow 
 beneath the oak which breaks away the wind 
 and bushes close in snow like hovel warm 
 there tainted mutton wastes upon the coals 
 and the half wasted dog squats close and rubs 
 then feels the heat too strong , and goes aloof 
 he watches well , but none a bit can spare 
 and vainly waits the morsel thrown away

the dame , it is true , would mutter “ shocking 
 and give her head a sorrowful rocking 
 and make a clucking with palate and tongue 
 like the call of partlet to gather her young

 lord of the tourney . and arthur had the jousts 
 down in the flat field by the shore of usk 
 holden : the gilded parapets were crowned 
 with faces , and the great tower filled with eyes 
 up to the summit , and the trumpets blew

mysterious night ! when our first parent knew 
 thee from report divine , and heard thy name 
 did he not tremble for this lovely frame 
 this glorious canopy of light and blue 
 yet ‘ neath the curtain of translucent dew 
 bathed in the rays of the great setting flame 
 hesperus with the host of heaven came 
 and lo ! creation widened on man 's view 
 who could have thought such darkness lay concealed

 the spectral future leads its mourning train 
 dark with the shadows of uncounted bands 
 where man 's white lips and woman 's wringing hands 
 track the still burden , rolling slow before 
 that love and kindness can protect no more 
 the smiling babe that , called to mortal strife 
 shuts its meek eyes and drops its little life

 and pleads for help its parent cannot give

 traced in sad lines beneath its silvered hair

 and the white foam a shroud for the white czar

 surmised in all those wandering ways wherein 
 man , led of love and life and death and sin

 of that full soul that had for aim to win 
 light , silent over time 's dark toil and din

 o spirit of man , what mystery moves in thee 
 that he might know not of in spirit , and see 
 the heart within the heart that seems to strive 
 the life within the life that seems to be 
 and hear , through all thy storms that whirl and drive 
 the living sound of all men 's souls alive 

the stars die out on avon 's watchful breast 
 while simple shepherds climb through shadows grey 
 with beating bosoms up the wrekin 's crest 
 to see the sun “ dance in ” an easter day 
 whose dawning consummates three centuries 
 since shakespeare 's death and entrance to the skies 
 resolved the radiant miracle not to miss 
 reserved alone to earliest opened eyes 
 we , too , with faces set towards the east 
 our joyful orison offerings yielding up 
 keep with our risen lord his pascal feast 
 from paten blest and consecrated cup 
 and give him thanks who of all realms of earth 
 made england richest by her shakespeare 's birth 

mute was the mighty organ . none might break 
 the silence that had thralled it since was stilled 
 the master hand beneath whose touch it thrilled 
 to music such as choiring seraphs make 
 until a mightier master came to wake 
 th ’ elusive chords and subtle harmonies 
 that lay imprisoned in the cold white keys 
 and once again the soul of music spake 
 methought my soul 's most perfect melodies 
 no hand again to sonance could evoke 
 a silent harp whose potence none might prove 
 but , lo ! one came who swept its chords and woke 
 celestial strains , divinest harmonies 
 responsive to the master touch of love 

the partial papists would infer from hence 
 their church , in last resort , should judge the sense 
 but first they would assume , with wondrous art 
 themselves to be the whole , who are but part 
 of that vast frame the church ; yet grant they were 
 the handers down , can they from thence infer 
 a right to interpret ? or would they alone 
 who brought the present , claim it for their own 
 the book 's a common largess to mankind 
 not more for them than every man design 'd 
 the welcome news is in the letter found 
 the carrier 's not commissioned to expound 
 it speaks itself , and what it does contain 
 in all things needful to be known is plain 

i thank you , kind and best belov ë d friend 
 with the same thanks one murmurs to a sister 
 when , for some gentle favor , he hath kissed her 
 less for the gifts than for the love you send 
 less for the flowers than what the flowers convey 
 if i , indeed , divine their meaning truly 
 and not unto myself ascribe , unduly 
 things which you neither meant nor wished to say 
 oh ! tell me , is the hope then all misplaced 
 and am i flattered by my own affection 
 but in your beauteous gift , methought i traced 
 something above a short lived predilection 
 and which , for that i know no dearer name 
 i designate as love , without love 's flame 

unhappy wit , like most mistaken things 
 atones not for that envy which it brings 
 in youth alone its empty praise we boast 
 but soon the short lived vanity is lost 
 like some fair flower the early spring supplies 
 that gayly blooms but even in blooming dies 
 what is this wit , which must our cares employ 
 the owner 's wife that other men enjoy 
 then most our trouble still when most admired 
 and still the more we give the more required 
 whose fame with pains we guard , but lose with ease 
 sure some to vex , but never all to please 
 ‘ tis what the vicious fear , the virtuous shun 
 by fools ‘ tis hated , and by knaves undone 

in an idle hour i thought of former days 
 and former friends seemed to be standing in the room 
 and then i wondered “ where are they now 
 like fallen leaves they have tumbled to the nether springs 
 han y ü[ 1 ] swallowed his sulphur pills 
 yet a single illness carried him straight to the grave 
 y ü an ch ē n smelted autumn stone 
 but before he was old , his strength crumbled away 
 master tu possessed the “ secret of health 
 all day long he fasted from meat and spice 
 the lord ts ‘ ui , trusting a strong drug 
 through the whole winter wore his summer coat 
 yet some by illness and some by sudden death 
 all vanished ere their middle years were passed 

one day the doctor found the bottle full 
 and , being thirsty , took a vigorous pull 
 put back the “ elixir ” where ‘ t was always found 
 and had old dobbin saddled and brought round 
 — you know those old time rhubarb colored nags 
 that carried doctors and their saddle bags 
 sagacious beasts ! they stopped at every place 
 where blinds were shut — knew every patient 's case 
 looked up and thought — the baby 's in a fit 
 that wo n't last long — he 'll soon be through with it 
 but shook their heads before the knockered door 
 where some old lady told the story o'er 
 whose endless stream of tribulation flows 
 for gastric griefs and peristaltic woes 

one that is ever kind said yesterday 
 “ your well beloved 's hair has threads of grey 
 and little shadows come about her eyes 
 time can but make it easier to be wise 
 though now it 's hard , till trouble is at an end 
 and so be patient , be wise and patient , friend 
 but , heart , there is no comfort , not a grain 
 time can but make her beauty over again 
 because of that great nobleness of hers 
 the fire that stirs about her , when she stirs 
 burns but more clearly . o she had not these ways 
 when all the wild summer was in her gaze 
 o heart ! o heart ! if she 'd but turn her head 
 you 'd know the folly of being comforted 

the castle gate stands open now 
 and the wanderer is welcome to the hall 
 as the hangbird is to the elm tree bough 
 no longer scowl the turrets tall 
 the summer 's long siege at last is o'er 
 when the first poor outcast went in at the door 
 she entered with him in disguise 
 and mastered the fortress by surprise 
 there is no spot she loves so well on ground 
 she lingers and smiles there the whole year round 
 the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land 
 has hall and bower at his command 
 and there 's no poor man in the north countree 
 but is lord of the earldom as much as he 

“ whatever toils the great ulysses pass 'd 
 beneath this happy roof they end at last 
 no longer now from shore to shore to roam 
 smooth seas and gentle winds invite him home 
 but hear me , princes ! whom these walls inclose 
 for whom my chanter sings : and goblet flows 
 with wine unmix 'd ( an honour due to age 
 to cheer the grave , and warm the poet 's rage 
 though labour 'd gold and many a dazzling vest 
 lie heap 'd already for our godlike guest 
 without new treasures let him not remove 
 large , and expressive of the public love 
 each peer a tripod , each a vase bestow 
 a general tribute , which the state shall owe 

ii . and in these lines my purpose is to show 
 that he who left the father , though he came 
 not with art splendour or the earthly flame 
 of genius , yet in that he did bestow 
 his own true loving heart , did cause to grow 
 unseen and buried deep , whate'er we name 
 the best in human art , without the shame 
 of idle sitting in most real woe 
 and that whate'er of beautiful and grand 
 the earth contains , by him was not despised 
 but rather was so deeply realized 
 in word and deed , though not with artist hand 
 that it was either hid or all disguised 
 from those who were not wise to understand 

wherefore should i mine own heart not unfold 
 and his true workings to the world disclose 
 why self unlocking for unseemly hold 
 which me , as i show 'd others , human shows 
 if i to nature held her truthful glass 
 and on the stage life 's self did strive to set 
 creating thousand shadows that should pass 
 for very substance when men 's eyes they met 
 if there i imag 'd love , hate , doubt , and trust 
 if all the pageant of the mortal heart 
 might not one say : ‘ this man within him must 
 have learn 'd from nature what he shap 'd in art 
 all passions ’ depths he only can reveal 
 who doth them all within him living feel 

thespis began the drama : rumour says 
 in travelling carts he carried round his plays 
 where actors , smeared with lees , before the throng 
 performed their parts with gesture and with song 
 then aeschylus brought in the mask and pall 
 put buskins on his men to make them tall 
 turned boards into a platform , not too great 
 and taught high monologue and grand debate 
 the elder comedy had next its turn 
 nor small the glory it contrived to earn 
 but freedom passed into unbridled spite 
 and law was soon invoked to set things right 
 law spoke : the chorus lost the power to sting 
 and ( shame to say ) thenceforth refused to sing 

not causeless were you christened , gentle flowers 
 the one of faith , the other fancy 's pride 
 for she who guides both faith and fancy 's power 
 in your fair colors wraps her ivory side 
 as one of you hath whiteness without stain 
 so spotless is my love and never tainted 
 and as the other shadoweth faith again 
 such is my lass , with no fond change acquainted 
 and as nor tyrant sun nor winter weather 
 may ever change sweet amaranthus ’ hue 
 so she though love and fortune join together 
 will never leave to be both fair and true 
 and should i leave thee then , thou pretty elf 
 nay , first let damon quite forget himself 

mysterious night ! when our first parent knew 
 thee from report divine , and heard thy name 
 did he not tremble for this lovely frame 
 this glorious canopy of light and blue 
 yet ‘ neath a curtain of translucent dew 
 bathed in the rays of the great setting flame 
 hesperus with the host of heaven came 
 and lo ! creation widened in man 's view 
 who could have thought such darkness lay concealed 
 within thy beams , o sun ! or who could find 
 whilst flow'r and leaf and insect stood revealed 
 that to such countless orbs thou mad'st us blind 
 why do we , then , shun death with anxious strife 
 if light can thus deceive , wherefore not life 

dayly when i do seeke and sew for peace 
 and hostages doe offer for ray truth 
 she , cruell warriour , doth her selfe addresse 
 to battell , and the weary war renew'th 
 ne wilbe moov 'd , with reason or with rewth 
 to graunt small respit to my restlesse toile 
 but greedily her fell intent poursewth 
 of my poore life to make unpittied spoile 
 yet my poore life , all sorrowes to assoyle 
 i would her yield , her wrath to pacify 
 but then she seeks , with torment and turmoyle 
 to force me live , and will not let me dy 
 all paine hath end , and every war hafh peace 
 but mine , no price nor prayer may surcease 

i know not why — but time , methinks , hath past 
 more fleet than usual since we parted last 
 it seems but like a dream of yesternight 
 whose charm still hangs , with fond , delaying light 
 and , ere the memory lose one glowing hue 
 of former joy , we come to kindle new 
 thus ever may the flying moments haste 
 with trackless foot along life 's vulgar waste 
 but deeply print and lingeringly move 
 when thus they reach the sunny spots we love 
 oh yes , whatever be our gay career 
 let this be still the solstice of the year 
 where pleasure 's sun shall at its height remain 
 and slowly sink to level life again 

within this wood , out of a rock did rise 
 a spring of water , mildly rumbling down 
 whereto approached not in any wise 
 the homely shepherd nor the ruder clown 
 but many muses and the nymphs withal 
 but while herein i took my chief delight 
 i saw ( alas !) the gaping earth devour 
 the spring , the place , and all clean out of sight 
 which yet aggrieves my heart unto this hour 
 at last , so fair a lady did i spy 
 that thinking yet on her i burn and quake 
 on herbs and flowers she walked pensively 
 a stinging serpent by the heel her caught 
 wherewith she languished as the gathered flower 

sweet wreck of loveliness ! alas , how soon 
 the sad brief summer of thy joys hath fled 
 how sorrow 's friendship for thy hapless doom 
 thy beauty faded , and thy hopes all dead 
 oh ! ‘ twas that beauty 's pow'r which first destroy 'd 
 thy mind 's serenity ; its charms but led 
 the faithless friend , that thy pure love enjoy 'd 
 to tear the blooming blossom from its bed 
 how reason shudders at thy frenzied air 
 to see thee smile , with fancy 's dreams possess 'd 
 or shrink , the frozen image of despair 
 or love enraptur 'd , chaunt thy griefs to rest 
 oh ! cease that mournful voice , poor suff'ring child 
 my heart but bleeds to hear thy musings wild 

muse of the many twinkling feet ! whose charms 
 are now extended up from legs to arms 
 terpsichore !— too long misdeem 'd a maid 
 reproachful term — bestow 'd but to upbraid 
 henceforth in all the bronze of brightness shine 
 the least a vestal of the virgin nine 
 far be from thee and thine the name of prude 
 mock 'd , yet triumphant ; sneer 'd at , unsubdued 
 thy legs must move to conquer as they fly 
 if but thy coats are reasonably high 
 thy breast , if bare enough , requires no shield 
 dance forth — sans armour thou shalt take the field 
 and own — impregnable to most assaults 
 thy not too lawfully begotten “ waltz 

thrise happie she that is so well assured 
 unto her selfe , and setled so in hart 
 that neither will for better be allured 
 ne feard with worse to any chaunce to start 
 but , like a steddy ship , doth strongly part 
 the raging waves , and kcepes her course aright 
 ne ought for tempest doth from it depart 
 ne ought for fayrer weathers false delight 
 such selfe assurance need not feare the spight 
 of grudging foes , ne favour seek of friends 
 but in the stay of her owne stedfast might 
 neither to one her selfe nor other bends 
 most happy she that most assur 'd doth rest 
 but he most happy who such one loves best 

rend hearts and rend not garments for our sins 
 gird sackcloth not on body but on soul 
 grovel in dust with faces toward the goal 
 nor won , nor neared : he only laughs who wins 
 not neared the goal , the race too late begins 
 or left undone , we have yet to do the whole 
 the sun is hurrying west and toward the pole 
 where darkness waits for earth with all her kins 
 let us to day , while it is called to day 
 set out , if utmost speed may yet avail 
 the shadows lengthen and the light grows pale 
 for who through darkness and the shadow of death 
 darkness that may be felt , shall find a way 
 blind eyed , deaf eared , and choked with failing breath 

the path runs straight between the flowering rows 
 a moonlit path , hemmed in by beds of bloom 
 where phlox and marigolds dispute for room 
 with tall , red dahlias and the briar rose 
 ‘ t is reckless prodigality which throws 
 into the night these wafts of rich perfume 
 which sweep across the garden like a plume 
 over the trees a single bright star glows 
 dear garden of my childhood , here my years 
 have run away like little grains of sand 
 the moments of my life , its hopes and fears 
 have all found utterance here , where now i stand 
 my eyes ache with the weight of unshed tears 
 you are my home , do you not understand 

when i have borne in memory what has tamed 
 great nations , how ennobling thoughts depart 
 when men change swords for ledgers , and desert 
 the student 's bower for gold , some fears unnamed 
 i had , my country ! am i to be blamed 
 but , when i think of thee , and what thou art 
 verily , in the bottom of my heart 
 of those unfilial fears i am ashamed 
 but dearly must we prize thee ; we who find 
 in thee a bulwark of the cause of men 
 and i by my affection was beguiled 
 what wonder , if a poet , now and then 
 among the many movements of his mind 
 felt for thee as a lover or a child 

i saw a river swift , whose fomy billowes 
 did wash the ground work of an old great wall 
 i saw it cover 'd all with griesly shadowes 
 that with black horror did the ayre appall 
 thereout a strange beast with seven heads arose 
 that townes and castles under her brest did coure 
 and seem 'd both milder beasts and fiercer foes 
 alike with equall ravine to devoure 
 much was i mazde to see this monsters kinde 
 in hundred formes to change his fearefull hew 
 when as at length i saw the wrathfull winde 
 which blows cold storms , burst out of scithian mew 
 that sperst these cloudes ; and , in so short as thought 
 this dreadfull shape was vanished to nought 

fresh spring , the herald of loves mighty king 
 in whose cote armour richly are displayd 
 all sorts of flowres the which on earth do spring 
 in goodly colours gloriously arrayd 
 goe to my love , where she is carelesse layd 
 yet in her winters bowre not well awake 
 tell her the ioyous time wil not be staid 
 unlesse she doe him by the forelock take 
 bid her therefore her selfe soone ready make 
 to wayt on love amongst his lovely crew 
 where every one that misseth then her make 
 shall be by him amearst with penance dew 
 make haste therefore , sweet love , while it is prime 
 for none can call againe the passed time

how many a time , while sauntering up and down 
 the forum 's space , or pausing ‘ neath the shade 
 of some grand temple , arch , or portico 
 have we discussed some knotty point of law 
 some curious case , whose contradicting facts 
 looked janus faced to innocence and guilt 
 i see you now arresting me , to note 
 with quiet fervor and uplifted hand 
 some subtle view or fact by me o'erlooked 
 and urging me , who always strain my point 
 ( being too much , i know , a partisan 
 to pause , and press not to the issue so 
 but more apart , with less impetuous zeal 
 survey as from an upper floor the facts 

ye cruell starres , and eke ye gods unkinde 
 heaven envious , and bitter stepdame nature 
 be it by fortune , or by course of kinde 
 that ye doo weld th'affaires of earthlie creature 
 why have your hands long sithence traveiled 
 to frame this world , that doth endure so long 
 or why were not these romane palaces 
 made of some matter no lesse firme and strong 
 i say not , as the common voyce doth say 
 that all things which beneath the moone have being 
 are temporall and subiect to decay 
 but i say rather , though not all agreeing 
 with some that weene the contrarie in thought 
 that all this whole shall one day come to nought 

no longer mourn for me when i am dead 
 than you shall hear the surly sullen bell 
 give warning to the world that i am fled 
 from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell 
 nay if you read this line , remember not 
 the hand that writ it , for i love you so 
 that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot 
 if thinking on me then should make you woe 
 o if ( i say ) you look upon this verse 
 when i ( perhaps ) compounded am with clay 
 do not so much as my poor name rehearse 
 but let your love even with my life decay 
 lest the wise world should look into your moan 
 and mock you with me after i am gone 

dan cupid , though the god of soft amour 
 in ev'ry age works miracles a store 
 can catos change to male coquets at ease 
 and fools make oracles whene'er he please 
 turn wolves to sheep , and ev'ry thing so well 
 that naught remains the former shape to tell 
 remember , hercules , with wond'rous pow'r 
 and polyphemus , who would men devour 
 the one upon a rock himself would fling 
 and to the winds his am'rous ditties sing 
 to cut his beard a nymph could him inspire 
 and , in the water , he 'd his face admire 
 his club the other to a spindle changed 
 to please the belle with whom he often ranged 

upon a summer 's day love went to swim 
 and cast himself into a sea of tears 
 the clouds called in their light , and heaven waxed dim 
 and sighs did raise a tempest , causing fears 
 the naked boy could not so wield his arms 
 but that the waves were masters of his might 
 and threatened him to work far greater harms 
 if he devis è d not to scape by flight 
 then for a boat his quiver stood instead 
 his bow unbent did serve him for a mast 
 whereby to sail his cloth of veil he spread 
 his shafts for oars on either board he cast 
 from shipwreck safe this wag got thus to shore 
 and sware to bathe in lovers ’ tears no more 

but now had hesper from the hero 's sight 
 veil 'd the vast world with sudden shades of night 
 earth , sea and heaven , where'er he turns his eye 
 arch out immense , like one surrounding sky 
 lamp 'd with reverberant fires . the starry train 
 paint their fresh forms beneath the placid main 
 fair cynthia here her face reflected laves 
 bright venus gilds again her natal waves 
 the bear redoubling foams with fiery joles 
 and two dire dragons twine two arctic poles 
 lights o'er the land , from cities lost in shade 
 new constellations , new galaxies spread 
 and each high pharos double flames provides 
 one from its fires , one fainter from the tides 

i would not if i could undo my past 
 tho ’ for its sake my future is a blank 
 my past , for which i have myself to thank 
 for all its faults and follies first and last 
 i would not cast anew the lot once cast 
 or launch a second ship for one that sank 
 or drug with sweets the bitterness i drank 
 or break by feasting my perpetual fast 
 i would not if i could : for much more dear 
 is one remembrance than a hundred joys 
 more than a thousand hopes in jubilee 
 dearer the music of one tearful voice 
 that unforgotten calls and calls to me 
 ‘ follow me here , rise up , and follow here 

and little dagonet mincing with his feet 
 “ knight , an ye fling those rubies round my neck 
 in lieu of hers , i 'll hold thou hast some touch

 is flesh and shadow — i have had my day 
 the dirty nurse , experience , in her kind 
 hath foul 'd me — an i wallow 'd , then i wash 'd 
 i have had my day and my philosophies 
 and thank the lord i am king arthur 's fool 
 swine , say ye ? swine , goats , asses , rams and geese 
 troop 'd round a paynim harper once , who thrumm 'd 
 on such a wire as musically as thou 
 some such fine song — but never a king 's fool 

three sliding years , with slowly blended change 
 drew round their winter , summer , autumn , spring 
 fulfilled of work by hands , and brain , and heart 
 he laboured as before ; though when he would 
 and nature urged not , he , with privilege 
 would spare from hours of toil — read in his room 
 or wander through the moorland to the hills 
 there on the apex of the world would stand 
 as on an altar , burning , soul and heart 
 himself the sacrifice of faith and prayer 
 gaze in the face of the inviting blue 
 that domed him round ; ask why it should be blue 
 pray yet again ; and with love strengthened heart 
 go down to lower things with lofty cares 

fayre is my love , when her fayre golden haires 
 with the loose wynd ye waving chance to marke 
 fayre , when the rose in her red cheekes appeares 
 or in her eyes the fyre of love does sparke 
 fayre , when her brest , lyke a rich laden barke 
 with pretious merchandize she forth doth lay 
 fayre , when that cloud of pryde , which oft doth dark 
 her goodly light , with smiles she drives away 
 but fayrest she , when so she doth display 
 the gate with pearles and rubyes richly dight 
 throgh which her words so wise do make their way 
 to beare the message of her gentle spright 
 the rest be works of natures wonderment 
 but this the worke of harts astonishment 

‘ twas a sweet time for nesace — for there 
 her world lay lolling on the golden air 
 near four bright suns — a temporary rest 
 an oasis in desert of the blest 
 away away — ‘ mid seas of rays that roll 
 empyrean splendor o'er th ’ unchained soul 
 the soul that scarce ( the billows are so dense 
 can struggle to its destin 'd eminence 
 to distant spheres , from time to time , she rode 
 and late to ours , the favour 'd one of god 
 but , now , the ruler of an anchor 'd realm 
 she throws aside the sceptre — leaves the helm 
 and , amid incense and high spiritual hymns 
 laves in quadruple light her angel limbs 

i am no model figure , or sign of care 
 but his eternal heart'shyppphenconsuming essence 
 in whom grief 's commentaries written are 
 drawing gross passion into pure quintessence 
 not thine eye 's fire , but fire of thine eye 's disdain 
 fed by neglect of my continual grieving 
 attracts the true life 's spirit of my pain 
 and gives it thee , which gives me no relieving 
 within thine arms sad elegies i sing 
 unto thine eyes a true heart love torn lay i 
 thou smell'st from me the savours sorrows bring 
 my tears to taste my truth to touch display i 
 lo thus each sense , dear fair one , i importune 
 but being care , thou flyest me as ill fortune 

lo ! o'er the welkin the tempestuous clouds 
 successive fly , and the loud piping wind 
 rocks the poor sea boy on the dripping shrouds 
 while the pale pilot , o'er the helm reclined 
 lists to the changeful storm : and as he plies 
 his wakeful task , he oft bethinks him , sad 
 of wife , and little home , and chubby lad 
 and the half strangled tear bedews his eyes 
 i , on the deck , musing on themes forlorn 
 view the drear tempest , and the yawning deep 
 nought dreading in the green sea 's caves to sleep 
 for not for me shall wife or children mourn 
 and the wild winds will ring my funeral knell 
 sweetly as solemn peal of pious passing bell 

they could not take the living god away 
 although they left his altar blank and bare 
 their ruthless hands could never rend and tear 
 more than the walls , they could not hope to sway 
 the utter faith that is the nation 's heart 
 they could not bring a real destruction where 
 hymn music had been softly wont to play 
 they smothered beauty , and tore hope apart 
 but in the house of one who is supreme 
 the marks they left will now be sanctified 
 the broken walls , when war is but a dream 
 will be a monument to those who died 
 and every shell torn scar will stand for one 
 whose hands were scarred , the christ men crucified 

then round me , on the light wind softly borne 
 i heard the numbers of an unseen harp 
 and turning , saw an angel near me stand 
 he sang of earthly love , and the soft tones 
 of his sweet harp were like aeolian strains 
 far breathing o'er some blissful eden world 
 and as i listened , all my holiest dreams 
 of harmony , ideal , grand , and high 
 seem 'd discord . then methought i saw 
 upon the morning hills , a bower arise 
 bright flowers of wondrous hues around it bloomed 
 all , all of beauty that the heart could dream 
 was there ; and , lov'lier far than all 
 a sweet eyed maiden , twining rose wreaths fair 

all that is perfect , which th'heaven beautefies 
 all that 's imperfect , borne belowe the moone 
 all that doth feede our spirits and our eies 
 and all that doth consume our pleasures soone 
 all the mishap the which our daies outweares 
 all the good hap of th'oldest times afore 
 rome , in the time of her great ancesters 
 like a pandora , locked long in store 
 but destinie this huge chaos turmoyling 
 in which all good and evill was enclosed 
 their heavenly vertues from these woes assoyling 
 caried to heaven , from sinfull bondage losed 
 but their great sinnes , the causers of their paine 
 under these antique ruines yet remaine 

having this day my horse , my hand , my lance 
 guided so well , that i obtain 'd the prize 
 both by the judgment of the english eyes 
 and of some sent from that sweet enemy france 
 horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance 
 townfolks my strength ; a daintier judge applies 
 his praise to sleight which from good use doth rise 
 some lucky wits impute it but to chance 
 others , because of both sides i do take 
 my blood from them who did excel in this 
 think nature me a man of arms did make 
 how far they shot awry ! the true cause is 
 stella look 'd on , and from her heavenly face 
 sent forth the beams which made so fair my race 

‘ man is of soul and body , formed for deeds 
 of high resolve , on fancy 's boldest wing 
 to soar unwearied , fearlessly to turn 
 the keenest pangs to peacefulness , and taste 
 the joys which mingled sense and spirit yield 
 or he is formed for abjectness and woe 
 to grovel on the dunghill of his fears 
 to shrink at every sound , to quench the flame 
 of natural love in sensualism , to know 
 that hour as blessed when on his worthless days 
 the frozen hand of death shall set its seal 
 yet fear the cure , though hating the disease 
 the one is man that shall hereafter be 
 the other , man as vice has made him now

as are the sands , fair licia , on the shore 
 or colored flowers , garlands of the spring 
 or as the frosts not seen , not felt before 
 or as the fruits that autumn forth doth bring 
 as twinkling stars , the tinsel of the night 
 or as the fish that gallop in the seas 
 as airs each part that still escapes our sight 
 so are my sighs , controllers of my ease 
 yet these are such as needs must have an end 
 for things finite none else hath nature done 
 only the sighs , which from my heart i send 
 will never cease , but where they first begun 
 accept them , sweet , as incense due to thee 
 for you immortal made them so to be 

i love to see the old heath 's withered brake 
 mingle its crimpled leaves with furze and ling 
 while the old heron from the lonely lake 
 starts slow and flaps his melancholy wing 
 and oddling crow in idle motions swing 
 on the half rotten ashtree 's topmost twig 
 beside whose trunk the gipsy makes his bed 
 up flies the bouncing woodcock from the brig 
 where a black quagmire quakes beneath the tread 
 the fieldfares chatter in the whistling thorn 
 and for the awe round fields and closen rove 
 and coy bumbarrels twenty in a drove 
 flit down the hedgerows in the frozen plain 
 and hang on little twigs and start again 

where shall a sorrow great enough be sought 
 for this sad ruin which the fates have wrought 
 unless the fates themselves should weep and wish 
 their curbless power had been controlled in this 
 for thy loss , worthiest lord , no mourning eye 
 has flood enough ; no muse nor elegy 
 enough expression to thy worth can lend 
 no , though thy sidney had survived his friend 
 dead , noble brooke shall be to us a name 
 of grief and honour still , whose deathless fame 
 such virtue purchased as makes us to be 
 unjust to nature in lamenting thee 
 wailing an old man 's fate as if in pride 
 and heat of youth he had untimely died 

not in such grief she left her country 's shores 
 when caesar 's host drew near ; for now she leaves 
 though faithful to her lord , his side in flight 
 and flees her spouse . all that next night she waked 
 then first what means a widowed couch she knew 
 its cold , its solitude . when slumber found 
 her eyelids , and forgetfulness her soul 
 seeking with outstretched arms the form beloved 
 she grasps but air . though tossed by restless love 
 she leaves a place beside her as for him 
 returning . yet she feared pompeius lost 
 to her for ever . but the gods ordained 
 worse than her fears , and in the hour of woe 
 gave her to look upon his face again 

both'ring the flats assembled round the quod 
 the queerum queerly smear 'd with dirty black 
 the dolman sounding , while the sheriff 's nod 
 prepare the switcher to dead book the whack 
 while in a rattle sit two blowens flash 
 salt tears fast streaming from each bungy eye 
 to nail the ticker , or to mill the cly 
 through thick and thin their busy muzzlers splash 
 the mots lament for tyburn 's merry roam 
 that bubbl 'd prigs must at the new drop fall 
 and from the start the scamps are cropp 'd at home 
 all in the sheriff 's picture frame the call 
 exalted high , dick parted with his flame 
 and all his comrades swore that he dy 'd game 

doe i not see that fayrest ym á ges 
 of hardest marble are of purpose made 
 for that they should endure through many ages 
 ne let theyr famous moniments to fade 
 why then doe i , untrainde in lovers trade 
 her hardnes blame , which i should more commend 
 sith never ought was excellent assayde 
 which was not hard t'atchive and bring to end 
 ne ought so hard , but he that would attend

 so do i hope her stubborne hart to bend 
 and that it then more stedfast will endure 
 only my paines wil be the more to get her 
 but , having her , my ioy wil be the greater 

thus near the gates conferring as they drew 
 argus , the dog , his ancient master knew 
 he , not unconscious of the voice and tread 
 lifts to the sound his ear , and rears his head 
 bred by ulysses , nourished at his board 
 but , ah ! not fated long to please his lord 
 to him , his swiftness and his strength were vain 
 the voice of glory called him o'er the main 
 till then , in every sylvan chase renowned 
 with argus , argus , rung the woods around 
 with him the youth pursued the goat or fawn 
 or traced the mazy leveret o'er the lawn 
 now left to man 's ingratitude he lay 
 unhoused , neglected in the public way 

i am in love with high far seeing places 
 that look on plains half sunlight and half storm 
 in love with hours when from the circling faces 
 veils pass , and laughing fellowship glows warm 
 you who look on me with grave eyes where rapture 
 and april love of living burn confessed 
 the gods are good ! the world lies free to capture 
 life has no walls . o take me to your breast 
 take me , — be with me for a moment 's span 
 i am in love with all unveiled faces 
 i seek the wonder at the heart of man 
 i would go up to the far seeing places 
 while youth is ours , turn toward me for a space 
 the marvel of your rapture lighted face 

they give thy letter to me , even now 
 i read and seem as if i heard thee speak 
 the master of thy galley still unlades 
 gift after gift ; they block my court at last 
 and pile themselves along its portico 
 royal with sunset , like a thought of thee 
 and one white she slave from the group dispersed 
 of black and white slaves ( like the checker work 
 pavement , at once my nation 's work and gift 
 now covered with this settle down of doves 
 one lyric woman , in her crocus vest 
 woven of sea wools , with her two white hands 
 commends to me the strainer and the cup 
 thy lip hath bettered ere it blesses mine 

x . cease then , nor order imperfection name 
 our proper bliss depends on what we blame 
 know thy own point : this kind , this due degree 
 of blindness , weakness , heav'n bestows on thee 
 submit .— in this , or any other sphere 
 secure to be as blest as thou canst bear 
 safe in the hand of one disposing pow'r 
 or in the natal , or the mortal hour 
 all nature is but art , unknown to thee 
 all chance , direction , which thou canst not see 
 all discord , harmony not understood 
 all partial evil , universal good 
 and , spite of pride , in erring reason 's spite 
 one truth is clear , whatever is , is right 

though narrow be that old man 's cares , and near 
 the poor old man is greater than he seems 
 for he hath waking empire , wide as dreams 
 an ample sovereignty of eye and ear 
 rich are his walks with supernatural chear 
 the region of his inner spirit teems 
 with vital sounds , and monitory gleams 
 of high astonishment and pleasing fear 
 he the seven birds hath seen that never part 
 seen the seven whistlers in their nightly rounds 
 and counted them : and oftentimes will start 
 for overhead are sweeping gabriel 's hounds 
 doom 'd , with their impious lord , the flying hart 
 to chase for ever , on aerial grounds 

god who can bind the stars eternally 
 with but a breath of spirit speech , a thought 
 who can within earth 's arms lay the mad sea 
 unseverably , and count it as sheer naught 
 with his all might could bind not you and me 
 for tho he pressed us heart to burning heart 
 and set then to the passion that enthralls 
 his sanction , still our souls stood e'er apart 
 as aliens beating fierce against the walls 
 of dark unsympathy that would upstart 
 stood aliens , aye ! and would tho we should meet 
 beyond the oblivion of unnumbered births 
 upon some world where time cannot repeat 
 the feeblest syllable that once was earth 's 

devouring time blunt thou the lion 's paws 
 and make the earth devour her own sweet brood 
 pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger 's jaws 
 and burn the long lived phoenix , in her blood 
 make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st 
 and do whate'er thou wilt swift footed time 
 to the wide world and all her fading sweets 
 but i forbid thee one most heinous crime 
 o carve not with thy hours my love 's fair brow 
 nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen 
 him in thy course untainted do allow 
 for beauty 's pattern to succeeding men 
 yet do thy worst old time : despite thy wrong 
 my love shall in my verse ever live young 

that time , fair licia , when i stole a kiss 
 from off those lips , where cupid lovely laid 
 i quaked for cold , and found the cause was this 
 my life which loved , for love behind me staid 
 i sent my heart my life for to recall 
 but that was held , not able to return 
 and both detained as captives were in thrall 
 and judged by her , that both by sighs should burn 
 fair , burn them both , for that they were so bold 
 but let the altar be within thy heart 
 and i shall live because my life you hold 
 you that give life , to every living part 
 a flame i took whenas i stole the kiss 
 take you my life , yet can i live with this 

dream footsteps wandering past us in our sleep 
 a restless presence stirring with the light 
 the cry of waters where the snow was white 
 a violet 's whisper where dead leaves lay deep 
 the dim wood 's music makes a sudden leap 
 broken notes , blending in a wild delight 
 and lo ! the whole world changes in our sight 
 promise is ended — we must turn and reap 
 fulfilment , for the spring with all her wealth 
 is with us , and compels us to her will 
 yet if the sun dawn we should shun by stealth 
 yearning for shadows and the darkened hours 
 sweet lord , be pitiful , remembering still 
 one lieth low beneath the budding flowers 

was this his coming ! i had hoped to see 
 a scene of wondrous glory , as was told 
 of some great god who in a rain of gold 
 broke open bars and fell on danae 
 or a dread vision as when semele 
 sickening for love and unappeased desire 
 prayed to see god 's clear body , and the fire 
 caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly 
 with such glad dreams i sought this holy place 
 and now with wondering eyes and heart i stand 
 before this supreme mystery of love 
 some kneeling girl with passionless pale face 
 an angel with a lily in his hand 
 and over both the white wings of a dove 

of thetis i sing with her locks of gold shine 
 the daughter of nereus , lord of the brine 
 to peleus wedded , by jove 's high decree 
 i sing her , the venus so fair of the sea 
 of the spearman tremendous , the mars of the fight 
 thunderbolt of old greece , she was quickly made light 
 of achilles divine , to whom pyrrha an heir 
 the boy neoptolemus , gladly did bear 
 the destroyer of trojans , of grecians the shield 
 thy protection to us , neoptolemus yield 
 who blessed doth slumber in pythia 's green plain 
 to accept this oblation of hymns from us deign 
 and each peril drive far from our city benign 
 of thetis i sing with her locks of gold shine 

when we kept our watch in the cold and damp 
 if the cattle broke from the sleeping camp 
 over the flats and across the plain 
 with my head bent down on his waving mane 
 through the boughs above and the stumps below 
 on the darkest night i could let him go 
 at a racing speed ; he would choose his course 
 and my life was safe with the old grey horse 
 but man and horse had a favourite job 
 when an outlaw broke from a station mob 
 with a right good will was the stockwhip plied 
 as the old horse raced at the straggler 's side 
 and the greenhide whip such a weal would raise 
 we could use the whip in the droving days 

ah pale and dying infant of the spring 
 how rightly now do i resemble thee 
 that selfsame hand that thee from stalk did wring 
 hath rent my breast and robbed my heart from me 
 yet shalt thou live . for why ? thy native vigour 
 shall thrive by woeful dew drops of my dolor 
 and from the wounds i bear through fancy 's rigour 
 my streaming blood shall yield the crimson color 
 the ravished sighs that ceaseless take their issue 
 from out the furnace of my heart inflamed 
 to yield you lasting springs shall never miss you 
 so by my plaints and pains , you shall be famed 
 let my heart 's heat and cold , thy crimson nourish 
 and by my sorrows let thy beauty flourish 

the next , though distant , menelaus succeeds 
 while thus young nestor animates his steeds 
 “ now , now , my generous pair , exert your force 
 not that we hope to match tydides ’ horse 
 since great minerva wings their rapid way 
 and gives their lord the honours of the day 
 but reach atrides ! shall his mare outgo 
 your swiftness ? vanquish ’ d by a female foe 
 through your neglect , if lagging on the plain 
 the last ignoble gift be all we gain 
 no more shall nestor ’ s hand your food supply 
 the old man ’ s fury rises , and ye die

 presents the occasion , could we use it right 

contending leaders at the word arose 
 each generous breast with emulation glows 
 so brave a task each ajax strove to share 
 bold merion strove , and nestor ’ s valiant heir 
 the spartan wish ’ d the second place to gain

the sex inclined to follow this advice 
 about receipts however they were not nice 
 the entertainment greatly was admired 
 and pure devotion all their bosoms fired 
 a glass of cordial some apart received 
 good cheer was given , may be well believed 
 ten youthful dames brisk friar fripart took 
 gay , airy , and engaging ev'ry look 
 who paid with pleasure all the monk could wish 
 some had fifteen :— some twelve to taste their dish

 and sink downright to satan when i die 
 or were i cursed with an unfruitful bed

shout , for a mighty victory is won 
 on british ground the invaders are laid low 
 the breath of heaven has drifted them like snow 
 and left them lying in the silent sun 
 never to rise again !— the work is done 
 come forth , ye old men , now in peaceful show 
 and greet your sons ! drums beat and trumpets blow 
 make merry , wives ! ye little children , stun 
 your grandame 's ears with pleasure of your noise 
 clap , infants , clap your hands ! divine must be 
 that triumph , when the very worst , the pain 
 and even the prospect of our brethren slain 
 hath something in it which the heart enjoys 
 in glory will they sleep and endless sanctity 

i said : this is a beautiful fresh rose 
 i said : i will delight me with its scent 
 will watch its lovely curve of languishment 
 will watch its leaves unclose , its heart unclose 
 i said : old earth has put away her snows 
 all living things make merry to their bent 
 a flower is come for every flower that went 
 in autumn ; the sun glows , the south wind blows 
 so walking in a garden of delight 
 i came upon one sheltered shadowed nook 
 where broad leaf shadows veiled the day with night 
 and there lay snow unmelted by the sun 
 i answered : take who will the path i took 
 winter nips once for all ; love is but one 

still , resignation was my dearest friend 
 and reason pointed to a glorious end 
 with anxious sighs , a parent 's hopes and pride 
 i wish 'd to live — i trust i could have died 
 but winter 's clouds pursu 'd their stormy way 
 and march brought sunshine with the length'ning day 
 and bade my heart arise , that morn and night 
 now throbb 'd with irresistible delight 
 delightful ‘ twas to leave disease behind 
 and feel the renovation of the mind 
 to lead abroad upborne on pleasure 's wing 
 our children , midst the glories of the spring 
 our fellow sufferers , our only wealth 
 to gather daisies in the breeze of health 

o thou ! whose steps in sacred reverence tread 
 these lone dominions of the silent dead 
 on this sad stone a pious look bestow 
 nor uninstructed read this tale of woe 
 and while the sigh of sorrow heaves thy breast 
 let each rebellious murmur be suppress 'd 
 heaven 's hidden ways to trace , for us how vain 
 heaven 's wise decrees , how impious to arraign 
 pure from the stains of a polluted age 
 in early bloom of life they left the stage 
 not doom 'd in lingering woe to waste their breath 
 one moment snatch 'd them from the power of death 
 they lived united , and united died 
 happy the friends whom death cannot divide 

sierra 's poet ! high and pure thy muse 
 enthroned doth sit amongst the stars and snows 
 and from thy harp olympian music flows 
 of glacier heights and gleaming mountain dews 
 of western sea and burning sunset hues 
 and we who look up — who on the plain repose 
 and catch faint glimpses of the mount that throws 
 athwart thy poet sight diviner views 
 and not alone from starry shrine is strung 
 thy lyre , but timed to gentler lay 
 that sings of children , motherhood and home 
 and lifts our hearts and lives to sweeter day 
 oh , bard of nature 's heart ! thy name will rest 
 immortal in thy land — our golden west 

already , if my mem'ry do not fail 
 i 've said , the youth 's estates were put to sale 
 to pay for feasts the fair to entertain 
 and what he 'd left was only one domain 
 a petty farm to which he now retired 
 ashamed to show where once so much admired 
 and wretched too , a prey to lorn despair 
 unable to obtain by splendid care 
 a beauty he 'd pursued six years and more 
 and should for ever fervently adore 
 his want of merit was the cause he thought 
 that she could never to his wish be brought 
 while from him not a syllable was heard 
 against the lovely belle his soul preferred 

at length i have thee ! my brisk new comer 
 sounding thy lay to departing summer 
 and i 'll take thee up from thy bed of grass 
 and carry thee home to a house of glass 
 where thy slender limbs , and the faded green 
 of thy close made coat , can all be seen 
 for i long to know if the cricket sings 
 or plays the tune with his gauzy wings 
 to bring that shrill toned pipe to light 
 which kept me awake so long last night 
 that i told the hours by the lazy clock 
 till i heard the crow of the noisy cock 
 when , tossing and turning , at length i fell 
 in a sleep so strange , that the dream i 'll tell 

enrapt , the queen gazed on her glorious self 
 then trembling with the thrill of sudden thought 
 commanded that the skilful wight be brought 
 that she might dower him with lands and pelf 
 then out upon the silent sea lapt shelf 
 and up the hills and on the downs they sought 
 him who so well and wondrously had wrought 
 and with much search found and brought home the elf 
 but he put by all gifts with sad replies 
 and from his lips these words flowed forth like wine 
 “ o queen , i want no gift but thee , ” he said 
 she heard and looked on him with love lit eyes 
 gave him her hand , low murmuring , “ i am thine 
 and at the morrow 's dawning they were wed 

the poetry of earth is never dead 
 when all the birds are faint with the hot sun 
 and hide in cooling trees , a voice will run 
 from hedge to hedge about the new mown mead 
 that is the grasshopper 's — he takes the lead 
 in summer luxury ,— he has never done 
 with his delights ; for when tired out with fun 
 he rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed 
 the poetry of earth is ceasing never 
 on a lone winter evening , when the frost 
 has wrought a silence , from the stove there shrills 
 the cricket 's song , in warmth increasing ever 
 and seems to one in drowsiness half lost 
 the grasshopper 's among some grassy hills 

a lamprey now appears , a sprawling fish 
 with shrimps about it swimming in the dish 
 whereon our host remarks : “ this fish was caught 
 while pregnant : after spawning it is naught 
 we make our sauce with oil , of the best strain 
 venafrum yields , and caviare from spain 
 pour in italian wine , five years in tun 
 while yet ‘ tis boiling ; when the boiling 's done 
 chian suits best of all ; white pepper add 
 and vinegar , from lesbian wine turned bad 
 rockets and elecampanes with this mess 
 to boil , is my invention , i profess 
 to put sea urchins in , unwashed as caught 
 ‘ stead of made pickle , was curtillus ’ thought 

slowly the hour hand of the clock moves round 
 so slowly that no human eye hath power 
 to see it move ! slowly in shine or shower 
 the painted ship above it , homeward bound 
 sails , but seems motionless , as if aground 
 yet both arrive at last ; and in his tower 
 the slumberous watchman wakes and strikes the hour 
 a mellow , measured , melancholy sound 
 midnight ! the outpost of advancing day 
 the frontier town and citadel of night 
 the watershed of time , from which the streams 
 of yesterday and to morrow take their way 
 one to the land of promise and of light 
 one to the land of darkness and of dreams 

vi . “ but yet the great of soul have ever been 
 the first to glory in all works of art 
 for from the genius form would ever dart 
 a light of inspiration , and a sheen 
 as of new comings ; and ourselves have seen 
 men of stern purpose to whose eyes would start 
 sorrow at sight of sorrow though no heart 
 did riot underneath that chilly , screen 
 and hence we judge such utterance native to 
 the human soul — expression highest — best 
 — nay , it is by such sign they will pursue 
 albeit unknowing , beauty , without rest 
 and failing in the search , themselves will fling 
 speechless before its shadow , worshipping 

day after day i dreamed there , while my heart 
 gathered up knowledge in its childish way 
 making fine pictures with unconscious art 
 and learning beauty more and more each day 
 ever and ever haunted i that spot 
 sitting in dells scooped out between the hills 
 that rising close around me , formed a grot 
 fragrant with ferns , and musical with rills 
 far up above me grew the long armed beech 
 dropping its branches down in graceful bent 
 while farther up , beyond my utmost reach 
 stood dusky hemlocks , crowning the ascent 
 and all about were sweeter sights and sounds 
 than elsewhere , but in poet 's dream , abounds

 is it because your eyes have powre to kill 
 then know that mercy is the mighties iewell 
 and greater glory think to save then spill 
 but if it be your pleasure and proud will 
 to shew the powre of your imperious eyes 
 then not on him that never thought you ill 
 but bend your force against your enemyes 
 let them feel the utmost of your crueltyes 
 and kill with looks , as cockatrices do 
 but him that at your footstoole humbled lies 
 with mercifull regard give mercy to 
 such mercy shall you make admyr 'd to be 
 so shall you live , by giving life to me 

homes of our sires , where learning 's temple rose 
 while vet they struggled with their banded foes 
 as in the west thy century 's sun descends 
 one parting gleam its dying radiance lends 
 darker and deeper though the shadows fall 
 from the gray towers on doubting castle 's wall 
 though pope and pagan re array their hosts 
 and her new armor youthful science boasts 
 truth , for whose altar rose this holy shrine 
 shall fly for refuge to these bowers of thine 
 no past shall chain her with its rusted vow 
 no jew 's phylactery bind her christian brow 
 but faith shall smile to find her sister free 
 and nobler manhood draw its life from thee 

o how i faint when i of you do write 
 knowing a better spirit doth use your name 
 and in the praise thereof spends all his might 
 to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame 
 but since your worth ( wide as the ocean is 
 the humble as the proudest sail doth bear 
 my saucy bark ( inferior far to his 
 on your broad main doth wilfully appear 
 your shallowest help will hold me up afloat 
 whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride 
 or ( being wrecked ) i am a worthless boat 
 he of tall building , and of goodly pride 
 then if he thrive and i be cast away 
 the worst was this , my love was my decay 

i live , sweet love , whereas the gentle wind 
 murmurs with sport in midst of thickest boughs 
 where loving woodbine doth the harbor bind 
 and chirping birds do echo forth my vows 
 where strongest elm can scarce support the vine 
 and sweetest flowers enameled have the ground 
 where muses dwell ; and yet hereat repine 
 that on the earth so rare a place was found 
 but winds delight , i wish to be content 
 i praise the woodbine , but i take no joy 
 i moan the birds that music thus have spent 
 as for the rest , they breed but mine annoy

 then shall i joy though all of these were gone 

the sister nuns so vigilant had been 
 one night when darkness overspread the scene 
 and all was proper mysteries to hide 
 some words escaped her cell that doubts supplied 
 and other matters too were heard around 
 that in her breviary could not be found 
 ‘ tis her gallant ! said they : he 's clearly caught 
 alarm pervaded ; swarms were quickly brought 
 rage seemed to triumph ; sentinels were placed 
 the abbess too must know they were disgraced 
 away they hastened to convey surprise 
 and , thund'ring at her door , cried , madam rise 
 for sister isabella , in her cell 
 has got a man , which surely can n't be well 

long have i loved the beauty of thy streets 
 fair dublin : long , with unavailing vows 
 sigh 'd to all guardian deities who rouse 
 the spirits of dead nations to new heats 
 of life and triumph :— vain the fond conceits 
 nestling like eaves warmed doves ‘ neath patriot brows 
 vain as the “ hope , ” that from thy custom house 
 looks o'er the vacant bay in vain for fleets 
 genius alone brings back the days of yore 
 look ! look , what life is in these quaint old shops 
 the loneliest lanes are rattling with the roar 
 of coach and chair ; fans , feathers , flambeaus , fops 
 flutter and flicker through yon open door 
 where handel 's hand moves the great organ stops 

there drew he forth the brand excalibur 
 and o'er him , drawing it , the winter moon 
 brightening the skirts of a long cloud , ran forth 
 and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt 
 for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks 
 myriads of topaz lights and jacinth work 
 of subtlest jewellery . he gazed so long 
 that both his eyes were dazzled , as he stood 
 this way and that dividing the swift mind 
 in act to throw : but at the last it seem 'd 
 better to leave excalibur conceal 'd 
 there in the many knotted waterflags 
 that whistled stiff and dry about the marge 
 so strode he back slow to the wounded king 

look in my griefs , and blame me not to mourn 
 from care to care that leads a life so bad 
 th'orphan of fortune , born to be her scorn 
 whose clouded brow doth make my days so sad 
 long are their nights whose cares do never sleep 
 loathsome their days who never sun yet joyed 
 the impression of her eyes do pierce so deep 
 that thus i live both day and night annoyed 
 yet since the sweetest root yields fruit so sour 
 her praise from my complaint i may not part 
 i love th'effect , the cause being of this power 
 i 'll praise her face and blame her flinty heart 
 whilst we both make the world admire at us 
 her for disdain , and me for loving thus 

o my heart 's heart , and you who are to me 
 more than myself myself , god be with you 
 keep you in strong obedience leal and true 
 to him whose noble service setteth free 
 give you all good we see or can foresee 
 make your joys many and your sorrows few 
 bless you in what you bear and what you do 
 yea , perfect you as he would have you be 
 so much for you ; but what for me , dear friend 
 to love you without stint and all i can 
 to day , to morrow , world without an end 
 to love you much and yet to love you more

in silent horror o'er the boundless waste 
 the driver hassan with his camels past 
 one cruise of water on his back he bore 
 and his light scrip contain 'd a scanty store 
 a fan of painted feathers in his hand 
 to guard his shaded face from scorching sand 
 the sultry sun had gain 'd the middle sky 
 and not a tree , and not an herb was nigh 
 the beasts with pain their dusty way pursue 
 shrill roar 'd the winds , and dreary was the view 
 with desperate sorrow wild , the affrighted man 
 thrice sigh 'd , thrice struck his breast , and thus began 
 ‘ sad was the hour , and luckless was the day 
 ‘ when first from schiraz ’ walls i bent my way 

e'en i who speak , alas ! have troubles met 
 within my bosom oft i feel regret 
 three children ere my marriage i had got 
 have i your father told this secret blot 
 have we together been less happy found 
 the list'ner had no sooner heard the sound 
 but like a man distracted off he flew 
 the saddle 's girth , which hazard near him threw 
 he took and fastened tightly ‘ bout his waist 
 then bawled around and round with anxious haste 
 i 'm girth 'd ! d'ye see , completely taken in 
 the people stared , an ‘ gan to laugh and grin 
 though each was conscious , if the truth were known 
 the ridicule in turn might be his own 

small , busy flames play through the fresh laid coals 
 and their faint cracklings o'er our silence creep 
 like whispers of the household gods that keep 
 a gentle empire o'er fraternal souls 
 and while , for rhymes , i search around the poles 
 your eyes are fix 'd , as in poetic sleep 
 upon the lore so voluble and deep 
 that aye at fall of night our care condoles 
 this is your birth day tom , and i rejoice 
 that thus it passes smoothly , quietly 
 many such eves of gently whisp'ring noise 
 may we together pass , and calmly try 
 what are this world 's true joys ,— ere the great voice 
 from its fair face , shall bid our spirits fly 

because i feel that , in the heavens above 
 the angels , whispering to one another 
 can find , among their burning terms of love 
 none so devotional as that of “ mother 
 therefore by that dear name i long have called you 
 you who are more than mother unto me 
 and fill my heart of hearts , where death installed you 
 in setting my virginia 's spirit free 
 my mother — my own mother , who died early 
 was but the mother of myself ; but you 
 are mother to the one i loved so dearly 
 and thus are dearer than the mother i knew 
 by that infinity with which my wife 
 was dearer to my soul than its soul life 

lord ! when you have enough , what need you care 
 how merrily soever others fare 
 though all the day i give and take delight 
 doubt not , sufficient will be left at night 
 ‘ tis but a just and rational desire 
 to light a taper at a neighbour 's fire 
 there 's danger too , you think , in rich array 
 and none can long be modest that are gay 
 the cat , if you but singe her tabby skin 
 the chimney keeps , and sits content within 
 but once grown sleek , will from her corner run 
 sport with her tail , and wanton in the sun 
 she licks her fair round face , and frisks abroad 
 to show her fur , and to be catterwaw 'd 

thou drowsy god , whose blurred eyes , half awink 
 muse on me —, drifting out upon thy dreams 
 i lave my soul as in enchanted streams 
 where revelling satyrs pipe along the brink 
 and tipsy with the melody they drink 
 uplift their dangling hooves , and down the beams 
 of sunshine dance like motes . thy languor seems 
 an ocean depth of love wherein i sink 
 like some fond argonaut , right willingly 
 because of wooing eyes upturned to mine 
 and siren arms that coil their sorcery 
 about my neck , with kisses so divine 
 the heavens reel above me , and the sea 
 swallows and licks its wet lips over me 

at last where hudson , with majestic pace 
 swells at the sight , and checks his rapid race 
 thro dark stillwater slow and silent moves 
 and flying troops with sullen pause reproves 
 a few firm bands their starry standard rear 
 wheel , front and face the desolating war 
 sudden the patriot flame each province warms 
 deep danger calls , the freemen quit their farms 
 seize their tried muskets , name their chiefs to lead 
 endorse their knapsacks and to vengeance speed 
 o'er all the land the kindling ardor flies 
 troop follows troop , and flags on flags arise 
 concentred , train 'd , their forming files unite 
 swell into squadrons and demand the fight 

fired with the martial deeds that bathed in gore 
 his brave companions on his native shore 
 trumbull with daring hand their fame recals 
 he shades with night quebec 's beleagured walls 
 thro flashing flames , that midnight war supplies 
 the assailants yield , their great montgomery dies 
 on bunker height , thro floods of hostile fire 
 his putnam toils till all the troops retire 
 his warren , pierced with balls , at last lies low 
 and leaves a victory to the wasted foe 
 britannia too his glowing tint shall claim 
 to pour new splendor on her calpean fame 
 he leads her bold sortie , and from their towers 
 o'erturns the gallic and iberian powers 

rise then , my son , first partner of my fame 
 with early toils to build thy sacred name 
 in high behest , for his own legate known 
 proclaim the bounties of our sire the sun 
 tell how his fruits beneath our culture rise 
 his stars , how glorious , gem our cloudless skies 
 and how to us his hand hath kindly given 
 his peaceful laws , the purest grace of heaven 
 with power to widen his terrestrial sway 
 and give our blessings where he gives the day 
 yet , should the stubborn nations still prepare 
 the shaft of slaughter for the barbarous war 
 tell them we know to tread the crimson plain 
 and god 's own children never yield to man 

he said , and agamemnon went his way 
 rejoicing ; through the crowd he pass 'd , and came 
 where stood th ’ ajaces ; them , in act to arm 
 amid a cloud of infantry he found 
 and as a goat herd from his watch tow'r crag 
 beholds a cloud advancing o'er the sea 
 by zephyr 's breath impell 'd ; as from afar 
 he gazes , black as pitch , it sweeps along 
 o'er the dark ocean 's face , and with it brings 
 a hurricane of rain ; he , shudd'ring , sees 
 and drives his flock beneath the shelt'ring cave 
 so thick and dark , about th ’ ajaces stirr 'd 
 impatient for the war , the stalwart youths 
 black masses , bristling close with spear and shield 

“ poor maiden ! ” thought the youth , “ if thou wert sent 
 “ with thy soft lute and beauty 's blandishment 
 “ to wake unholy wishes in this heart 
 “ or tempt its truth , thou little know'st the art 
 “ for tho ’ thy lips should sweetly counsel wrong 
 “ those vestal eyes would disavow its song 
 “ but thou hast breathed such purity , thy lay 
 “ returns so fondly to youth 's virtuous day 
 “ and leads thy soul — if e'er it wandered thence 
 “ so gently back to its first innocence 
 “ that i would sooner stop the unchained dove 
 “ when swift returning to its home of love 
 “ and round its snowy wing new fetters twine 
 “ than turn from virtue one pure wish of thine 

i see gray teachers ,— on their work intent 
 their lavished lives , in endless labor spent 
 had closed at last in age and penury wrecked 
 martyrs , not burned , but frozen in neglect 
 save for the generous hands that stretched in aid 
 of worn out servants left to die half paid 
 ah , many a year will pass , i thought , ere we 
 such kindly forethought shall rejoice to see 
 monarchs are mindful of the sacred debt 
 that cold republics hasten to forget 
 i see the priest ,— if such a name he bears 
 who without pride his sacred vestment wears 
 and while the symbols of his tribe i seek 
 thus my first impulse bids me think and speak 

looking far foorth into the ocean wide 
 a goodly ship with banners bravely dight 
 and flag in her top gallant , i espide 
 through the maine sea making her merry flight 
 faire blewe the wind into her bosome right 
 and th'heavens looked lovely all the while 
 that she did seeme to daunce , as in delight 
 and at her owne felicitie did smile 
 all sodainely there clove unto her keele 
 a little fish that men call remora 
 which stopt her course , and held her by the heele 
 that winde nor tide could move her thence away 
 straunge thing me seemeth , that so small a thing 
 should able be so great an one to wring 

we bowled along the pleasant country lanes 
 by wooded heights and blossom covered plains 
 see ! said he , there 's my house among the trees 
 sheltered , yet open to the southern breeze 
 in that beyond , with other two , you see 
 whose grounds close round my own so pleasantly 
 live valued friends of whom i never tire 
 with each abode a telegraphic wire 
 communicates , so , when we feel inclined 
 for whist or billiards , after we have dined 
 we telegraph to fix the time and place 
 and oft arrange a meet for hunt and chase 
 which is convenient , as you soon will see 
 and makes us like one social family 

meantime the train , proceeding on their way 
 from far the town and lofty tow'rs survey 
 at length approach the walls . without the gate 
 they see the boys and latian youth debate 
 the martial prizes on the dusty plain 
 some drive the cars , and some the coursers rein 
 some bend the stubborn bow for victory 
 and some with darts their active sinews try 
 a posting messenger , dispatch 'd from hence 
 of this fair troop advis 'd their aged prince 
 that foreign men of mighty stature came 
 uncouth their habit , and unknown their name 
 the king ordains their entrance , and ascends 
 his regal seat , surrounded by his friends 

i saw a silver swan swim down the lea 
 singing a sad farewell unto the vale 
 while fishes leapt to hear her melody 
 and on each thorn a gentle nightingale 
 and many other birds forbore their notes 
 leaping from tree to tree , as she along 
 the panting bosom of the current floats 
 rapt with the music of her dying song 
 when from a thick and all entangled spring 
 a neatherd rude came with no small ado 
 dreading an ill presage to hear her sing 
 and quickly struck her tender neck in two 
 whereat the birds , methought , flew thence with speed 
 and inly griev 'd for such a cruel deed 

o that i had the thracian poets harpe 
 for to awake out of th'infernall shade 
 those antique caesars , sleeping long in darke 
 the which this auncient citie whilome made 
 or that i had amphions instrument 
 to quicken with his vitall notes accord 
 the stonie ioynts of these old walls now rent 
 by which th'ausonian light might be restor 'd 
 or that at least i could with pencill fine 
 fashion the pourtraicts of these palacis 
 by paterne of great virgils spirit divine 
 i would assay with that which in me is 
 to builde , with levell of my loftie style 
 that which no hands can evermore compyle 

ah , god ! the world needs many hours to make 
 nor hast thou ceased the making of it yet 
 but wilt be working on when death hath set 
 a new mound in some churchyard for my sake 
 on flow the centuries without a break 
 uprise the mountains , ages without let 
 the mosses suck the rock 's breast , rarely wet 
 years more than past , the young earth yet will take 
 but in the dumbness of the rolling time 
 no veil of silence will encompass me 
 thou wilt not once forget , and let me be 
 i easier think that thou , as i my rhyme 
 wouldst rise , and with a tenderness sublime 
 unfold a world , that i , thy child , might see 

sweet hand , the sweet but cruel bow thou art 
 from whence at me five ivory arrows fly 
 so with five wounds at once i wounded lie 
 bearing my breast the print of every dart 
 saint francis had the like , yet felt no smart 
 where i in living torments never die 
 his wounds were in his hands and feet ; where i 
 all these five helpless wounds feel in my heart 
 now , as saint francis , if a saint am i 
 the bow that shot these shafts a relic is 
 i mean the hand , which is the reason why 
 so many for devotion thee would kiss 
 and some thy glove kiss as a thing divine 
 this arrows ’ quiver , and this relic 's shrine 

hark , hark , a voice amid the quiet intense 
 it is thy duty waiting thee without 
 rise from thy knees in hope , the half of doubt 
 a hand doth pull thee — it is providence 
 open thy door straightway , and get thee hence 
 go forth into the tumult and the shout 
 work , love , with workers , lovers , all about 
 of noise alone is born the inward sense 
 of silence ; and from action springs alone 
 the inward knowledge of true love and faith 
 then , weary , go thou back with failing breath 
 and in thy chamber make thy prayer and moan 
 one day upon his bosom , all thine own 
 thou shall lie still , embraced in holy death 

again , and through the arras of the gloom 
 are the pale breezes moaning : by her tomb 
 bends julio , like a phantom , and his eye 
 is fallen , as the moon borne tides , that lie 
 at ebb within the sea . oh ! he is wan 
 as winter skies are wan , like ages gone 
 and stars unseen for paleness ; it is cast 
 as foliage in the raving of the blast 
 all his fair bloom of thoughts ! is the moon chill 
 that in the dark clouds she is mantled still 
 and over its proud arch hath heaven flung 
 a scarf of darkness ? agath è was young 
 and there should be the virgin silver there 
 the snow white fringes delicately fair 

and now , amid the ruin 's darkest shade 
 the virgin 's eye beheld where pale blue flames 
 rose wavering , now just gleaming from the earth 
 and now in darkness drown 'd . an aged man 
 sat near , seated on what in long past days 
 had been some sculptur 'd monument , now fallen 
 and half obscured by moss , and gathered heaps 
 of withered yew leaves and earth mouldering bones 
 and shining in the ray was seen the track 
 of slimy snail obscene . composed his look 
 his eye was large and rayless , and fix 'd full 
 upon the maid ; the blue flames on his face 
 stream 'd a pale light ; his face was of the hue 
 of death ; his limbs were mantled in a shroud 

he fought in vain ; and on this spot went down 
 the jus divinum , and the kingly crown 
 but for those scenes time long has made amends 
 the ancient enemies are present friends 
 two swords , in massachusetts , rich in dust 
 and , better still , the peacefulness of rust 
 told the whole story in its double parts 
 to one who lives in two great nations ’ hearts 
 and late above old england 's roar and din 
 slow tolling bells spoke sympathy of kin 
 victoria 's wreath blooms on the sleeping breast 
 of him just gone to his reward and rest 
 and firm and fast between two mighty powers 
 new treaties live in those undying flowers 

patience , long sick to death , is dead . too long 
 have sloth and doubt and treason bidden us be 
 what cromwell 's england was not , when the sea 
 to him bore witness given of blake how strong 
 she stood , a commonweal that brooked no wrong 
 from foes less vile than men like wolves set free 
 whose war is waged where none may fight or flee 
 with women and with weanlings . speech and song 
 lack utterance now for loathing . scarce we hear 
 foul tongues that blacken god 's dishonoured name 
 with prayers turned curses and with praise found shame 
 defy the truth whose witness now draws near 
 to scourge these dogs , agape with jaws afoam 
 down out of life . strike , england , and strike home 

meanwhile , convened at priam ’ s palace gate 
 the trojan peers in nightly council sate 
 a senate void of order , as of choice 
 their hearts were fearful , and confused their voice 
 antenor , rising , thus demands their ear 
 “ ye trojans , dardans , and auxiliars , hear 
 ’ tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires 
 and i but move what every god requires 
 let sparta ’ s treasures be this hour restored 
 and argive helen own her ancient lord 
 the ties of faith , the sworn alliance , broke 
 our impious battles the just gods provoke 
 as this advice ye practise , or reject 
 so hope success , or dread the dire effect 

who 'll , know it ? richard earnestly replied 
 in jack 's concealment we may both confide 
 excuse the trick i 've played and ne'er repine 
 address , force , treachery , in love combine 
 all are permitted when intrigue ‘ s the word 
 to hold the contrary were quite absurd 
 till stratagem was used i naught could gain 
 but looks and darts from eyes , for all my pain 
 i 've paid myself ;— would you have done it ?— no 
 ‘ tis all as might be wished ;— come , smiles bestow 
 i 'm satisfied , the fault was not with you 
 in this , to make you wretched , naught i view 
 why sigh and groan ?— what numbers could i name 
 who would be happy to be served the same 

and lest , by length of time , it be pretended 
 the climate may this modern breed have mended 
 wise providence , to keep us where we are 
 mixes us daily with exceeding care 
 we have been europe 's sink , the jakes , where she 
 voids all her offal out cast progeny 
 from our fifth henry 's time the strolling bands 
 of banish 'd fugitives from neighb'ring lands 
 have here a certain sanctuary found 
 the eternal refuge of the vagabond 
 where in but half a common age of time 
 borrowing new blood and manners from the clime 
 proudly they learn all mankind to contemn 
 and all their race are true born englishmen 

when in the mines of dark and silent thought 
 sometimes i delve and find strange fancies there 
 with heavy labour to the surface brought 
 that lie and mock me in the brighter air 
 poor ores from starv è d lodes of poverty 
 unfit for working or to be refined 
 that in the darkness cheat the miner 's eye 
 i turn away from that base cave , the mind 
 yet had i but the power to crush the stone 
 there are strange metals hid in flakes therein 
 each flake a spark sole hidden and alone 
 that only cunning , toilsome chemists win 
 all this i know , and yet my chemistry 
 fails and the pregnant treasures useless lie 

the lights are high on beacon and from bower 
 and ‘ midst them conrad seeks medora 's tower 
 he looks in vain — ‘ tis strange — and all remark 
 amid so many , hers alone is dark 
 ‘ tis strange — of yore its welcome never failed 
 nor now , perchance , extinguished — only veiled 
 with the first boat descends he for the shore 
 and looks impatient on the lingering oar 
 oh ! for a wing beyond the falcon 's flight 
 to bear him like an arrow to that height 
 with the first pause the resting rowers gave 
 he waits not — looks not — leaps into the wave 
 strives through the surge , bestrides the beach , and high 
 ascends the path familiar to his eye 

the prateling nests meane while no silence keep 
 their wandring guests ne ’ re sleep 
 to ’ s mate , the turtle ’ mong ’ st the branches grones 
 and with complaints breakes hardest stones 
 the nightingale , the pleasant groves about 
 refresheth , with her warbling note 
 bewayles her losse to th ’ woods , i ’ th ’ cruell fields 
 ’ gainst tereus her cryes shee yeilds 
 and what the mournfull birds doe so complaine 
 the shrill woods answer back againe 
 the oke , the alder tells ; the poplar tree 
 the ash ; and that , the elme stands by 
 the groves rejoyce with th ’ eccho they afford 
 and tell them backe — ev ’ n word for word 

o pope ! instructor of my studious days 
 who fix 'd my steps in virtue 's early ways 
 on whom our labours , and our hopes depend 
 thou more than patron , and ev'n more than friend 
 above all flattery , all thirst of gain 
 and mortal but in sickness , and in pain 
 thou taught'st old satire nobler fruits to bear 
 and check 'd her licence with a moral care 
 thou gav'st the thought new beauties not its own 
 and touch 'd the verse with graces yet unknown 
 each lawless branch thy level eye survey 'd 
 and still corrected nature as she stray 'd 
 warm 'd boileau 's sense with britain 's genuine fire 
 and added softness to tasson è' s lyre 

thought was born blind , but thought knows what is seeing 
 its careful touch , deciphering forms from shapes 
 still suggests form as aught whose proper being 
 mere finding touch with erring darkness drapes 
 yet whence , except from guessed sight , does touch teach 
 that touch is but a close and empty sense 
 how does mere touch , self uncontented , reach 
 for some truer sense ’ s whole intelligence 
 the thing once touched , if touch be now omitted 
 stands yet in memory real and outward known 
 so the untouching memory of touch is fitted 
 with sense of a sense whereby far things are shown 
 so , by touch of untouching , wrongly aright 
 touch ’ thought of seeing sees not things but sight 

hail oklahoma land ! o prairie plain 
 there is no state more dearly loved .— all hail 
 where grassy hills and sheltered cove and vale 
 rest quietly in peace — and in refrain 
 our voices lift in praise and joy again 
 we sing of oklahoma land .— all hail 
 of sunny skies and even windy gale 
 and wealth of growing corn and flowing grain 
 where black gold gleams and roses bloom in spring 
 here long roads stretch and grazing cow herds roam 
 we build in faith great churches and our state 
 with many schools , where children gaily sing 
 we love our loamy fields and prairie home 
 and struggle onward upward , soon and late 

iii . art is the bond of weakness , and we find 
 therein acknowledgment of failing power 
 a man would worship , gazing on a flower 
 onward he passeth , lo his eyes are blind 
 the unenlivened form he left behind 
 grew up within him only for an hour 
 and he will grapple with nature till the dower 
 of strength shall be retreasured in his mind 
 and each form record is a high protest 
 of treason done unto the soul of man 
 which , striving upwards , ever is oppress 'd 
 by the old bondage , underneath whose ban 
 he , failing in his struggle for the best 
 must live in pain upon what food he can 

yet while they rode together down the plain 
 their talk was all of training , terms of art 
 diet and seeling , jesses , leash and lure 
 ‘ she is too noble ’ he said ‘ to check at pies 
 nor will she rake : there is no baseness in her 
 here when the queen demanded as by chance 
 ‘ know ye the stranger woman ? ’ ‘ let her be 
 said lancelot and unhooded casting off 
 the goodly falcon free ; she towered ; her bells 
 tone under tone , shrilled ; and they lifted up 
 their eager faces , wondering at the strength 
 boldness and royal knighthood of the bird 
 who pounced her quarry and slew it . many a time 
 as once — of old — among the flowers — they rode 

lanval ! ‘ tis told , had pass 'd from foreign strand 
 and kinsmen none there dwelt on english land 
 and well he knew that in the hour of proof 
 friends for the most part fail , and stand aloof 
 sue them he would not , but with manly pride 
 in silence turn 'd , and toward his prison hied 
 with generous grief the deed sir gawaine view 'd 
 dear to the king was he , and nephew of his blood 
 but liberal worth past nature 's ties prevail 'd 
 and sympathy stood forth , if friendship fail 'd 
 nor less good will full many a knight inspir 'd 
 with general voice the prisoner all requir 'd 
 all pledg 'd their fiefs he should not fail the day 
 and homeward bore him from the court away 

his nell sat on newgate steps , and scratch 'd her poll 
 her eyes suffus 'd with tears , and bung 'd with gin 
 the session 's sentence wrung her to the soul 
 nor could she lounge the gag to shule a win 
 the knowing bench had tipp 'd her buzer queer 
 for dick had beat the hoof upon the pad 
 of field , or chick lane — was the boldest lad 
 that ever mill 'd the cly , or roll 'd the leer 
 and with nell he kept a lock , to fence , and tuz 
 and while his flaming mot was on the lay 
 with rolling kiddies , dick would dive and buz 
 and cracking kens concluded ev'ry day 
 but fortune fickle , ever on the wheel

he kept his secret ; but the seed of crime 
 bursts of itself in god 's appointed time 
 the lives he wrecked were scattered far and wide 
 one never blamed nor wept ,— she only died 
 none knew his lot , though idle tongues would say 
 he sought a lonely refuge far away 
 and there , with borrowed name and altered mien 
 he died unheeded , as he lived unseen 
 the moral market had the usual chills 
 of virtue suffering from protested bills 
 the white cravats , to friendship 's memory true 
 sighed for the past , surveyed the future too 
 their sorrow breathed in one expressive line 
 “ gave pleasant dinners ; who has got his wine 

the larks are loud above our leagues of whin 
 now the sun 's perfume fills their glorious gold 
 with odour like the colour : all the wold 
 is only light and song and wind wherein 
 these twain are blent in one with shining din 
 and now your gift , a giver 's kingly souled 
 dear old fast friend whose honours grow not old 
 bids memory 's note as loud and sweet begin 
 though all but we from life be now gone forth 
 of that bright household in our joyous north 
 where i , scarce clear of boyhood just at end 
 first met your hand ; yet under life 's clear dome 
 now seventy strenuous years have crowned my friend 
 shines no less bright his full sheaved harvest home 

when mourn the dark winds o'er the lonely plain 
 and from pale noon sinks , ere the fifth cold hour 
 the transient light , imagination 's power 
 with knowledge , and with science in her train 
 not unpropitious hyems ’ icy reign 
 perceives ; since in the deep and silent lour 
 high themes the rapt concent'ring thoughts explore 
 freed from external pleasure 's glittering chain 
 then most the understanding 's culture pays 
 luxuriant harvest , nor shall folly bring 
 her aids obtrusive .— then , with ardent gaze 
 the ingenious to their rich resources spring 
 while sullen winter 's dull imprisoning days 
 hang on the vacant mind with flagging wing 

“ queen of this strange and spectral land , wilt thou 
 not show thy favor to a lonesome child 
 come wandering all this way , impelled by love 
 not hate , ambition , curiosity 
 have led me to thy fair and fearful presence 
 i have no power , am but a weak young girl 
 and chance , alone , has thus revealed to me 
 the mystic glory of this unknown world 
 with thy bright self and this enchanted isle 
 this pearl upon the bosom of the deep 
 so palely , purely fair — undreamed of beauty 
 love is the sole excuse which i can urge 
 for my intrusion ” — here the stranger blushed 
 drooping in silence her embarrassed head 

if e'er again return those awful days 
 whose clouds were crimsoned with the beacon 's blaze 
 whose grass was trampled by the soldier 's heel 
 whose tides were reddened round the rushing keel 
 god grant some lyre may wake a nobler strain 
 to rend the silence of our tented plain 
 when gallia 's flag its triple fold displays 
 her marshalled legions peal the marseillaise 
 when round the german close the war clouds dim 
 far through their shadows floats his battle hymn 
 when , crowned with joy , the camps ’ of england ring 
 a thousand voices shout , “ god save the king 
 when victory follows with our eagle 's glance 
 our nation 's anthem pipes a country dance 

on this foundation fame 's high temple stands 
 stupendous pile ! not rear 'd by mortal hands 
 whate'er proud rome or artful greece beheld 
 or elder babylon , its frame excell 'd 
 four faces had the dome , and every face 
 of various structure , but of equal grace 
 four brazen gates , on columns lifted high 
 salute the different quarters of the sky 
 here fabled chiefs in darker ages born 
 or worthies old , whom arms or arts adorn 
 who cities raised , or tamed a monstrous race 
 the walls in venerable order grace 
 heroes in animated marble frown 
 and legislators seem to think in stone 

my reason absent did mine eyes require 
 to watch and ward and such foes to descry 
 as they should ne'er my heart approaching spy 
 but traitor eyes my heart 's death did conspire 
 corrupted with hope 's gifts ; let in desire 
 to burn my heart ; and sought no remedy 
 though store of water were in either eye 
 which well employed , might well have quenched the fire 
 reason return è d ; love and fortune made 
 judges , to judge mine eyes to punishment 
 fortune , sith they by sight my heart betrayed 
 from wish è d sight , adjudged them banishment 
 love , sith by fire murdered my heart was found

great truths are portions of the soul of man 
 great souls are portions of eternity 
 each drop of blood that e'er through true heart ran 
 with lofty message , ran for thee and me 
 for god 's law , since the starry song began 
 hath been , and still forevermore must be 
 that every deed which shall outlast time 's span 
 must spur the soul to be erect and free 
 slave is no word of deathless lineage sprung 
 too many noble souls have thought and died 
 too many mighty poets lived and sung 
 and our good saxon , from lips purified 
 with martyr fire , throughout the world hath rung 
 too long to have god 's holy cause denied 

chained by stern duty to the rock of state 
 his spirit armed in mail of rugged mirth 
 ever above , though ever near to earth 
 yet felt his heart the cruel tongues that sate 
 base appetites and , foul with slander , wait 
 till the keen lightnings bring the awful hour 
 when wounds and suffering shall give them power 
 most was he like to luther , gay and great 
 solemn and mirthful , strong of heart and limb 
 tender and simple , too ; he was so near 
 to all things human that he cast out fear 
 and , ever simpler , like a little child 
 lived in unconscious nearness unto him 
 who always on earth 's little ones hath smiled 

toussaint , the most unhappy man of men 
 whether the rural milk maid by her cow 
 sing in thy hearing , or thou liest now 
 alone in some deep dungeon 's earless den 
 o miserable chieftain ! where and when 
 wilt thou find patience ? yet die not ; do thou 
 wear rather in thy bonds a chearful brow 
 though fallen thyself , never to rise again 
 live , and take comfort . thou hast left behind 
 powers that will work for thee ; air , earth , and skies 
 there 's not a breathing of the common wind 
 that will forget thee ; thou hast great allies 
 thy friends are exultations , agonies 
 and love , and man 's unconquerable mind 

‘ what had i lost , if , conjugally kind 
 by nature hating , yet by vows confined 
 untaught the matrimonial bonds to slight 
 and coldly conscious of a husband 's right 
 you had faint drawn me with a form alone 
 a lawful lump of life by force your own 
 then , while your backward will retrenched desire 
 and unconcurring spirits lent no fire 
 i had been born your dull , domestic heir 
 load of your life , and motive of your care 
 perhaps been poorly rich , and meanly great 
 the slave of pomp , a cipher in the state 
 lordly neglectful of a worth unknown 
 and slumbering in a seat by chance my own 

because i feel that , in the heavens above 
 the angels , whispering to one another 
 can find , among their burning terms of love 
 none so devotional as that of “ mother 
 therefore by that dear name i long have called you 
 you who are more than mother unto me 
 and fill my heart of hearts , where death installed you 
 in setting my virginia 's spirit free 
 my mother — my own mother , who died early 
 was but the mother of myself ; but you 
 are mother to the one i loved so dearly 
 and thus are dearer than the mother i knew 
 by that infinity with which my wife 
 was dearer to my soul than its soul life 

glory beyond all flight of warlike fame 
 go with the warrior 's memory who preferred 
 to praise of men whereby men 's hearts are stirred 
 and acclamation of his own proud name 
 with blare of trumpet blasts and sound and flame 
 of pageant honour , and the titular word 
 that only wins men worship of the herd 
 his country 's sovereign good ; who overcame 
 pride , wrath , and hope of all high chance on earth 
 for this land 's love that gave his great heart birth 
 o nursling of the sea winds and the sea 
 immortal england , goddess ocean born 
 what shall thy children fear , what strengths not scorn 
 while children of such mould are born to thee 

‘ whatever spirit , careless of his charge 
 his post neglects , or leaves the fair at large 
 shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins 
 be stopped in vials , or transfixed with pins 
 or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie 
 or wedged whole ages in a bodkin 's eye 
 gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain 
 while clogged he beats his silken wings in vain 
 or alum styptics with contracting power 
 shrink his thin essence like a rivelled flower 
 or , as ixion fixed , the wretch shall feel 
 the giddy motion of the whirling mill 
 in fumes of burning chocolate shall glow 
 and tremble at the sea that froths below 

while with false pride , and narrow jealousy 
 numbers reject each new expression , won 
 perchance , from language richer than our own 
 o ! with glad welcome may the poet see 
 extension 's golden vantage ! the decree 
 each way exclusive , scorn , and re enthrone 
 the obsolete , if strength , or grace of tone 
 or imagery await it , with a free 
 and liberal daring !— for the critic train 
 whose eyes severe our verbal stores review 
 let the firm bard require that they explain 
 their cause of censure ; then in balance true 
 weigh it ; but smile at the objections vain 
 of sickly spirits , hating for they do 

against that time ( if ever that time come 
 when i shall see thee frown on my defects 
 when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum 
 called to that audit by advised respects 
 against that time when thou shalt strangely pass 
 and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye 
 when love converted from the thing it was 
 shall reasons find of settled gravity 
 against that time do i ensconce me here 
 within the knowledge of mine own desert 
 and this my hand , against my self uprear 
 to guard the lawful reasons on thy part 
 to leave poor me , thou hast the strength of laws 
 since why to love , i can allege no cause 

a dream there is wherein we are fain to scream 
 while struggling with ourselves we cannot speak 
 and much of all our waking life , as weak 
 and misconceived , eludes us like the dream 
 for half life 's seemings are not what they seem 
 and vain the laughs we laugh , the shrieks we shriek 
 yea , all is vain that mars the settled meek 
 contented quiet of our daily theme 
 when i was young i deemed that sweets are sweet 
 but now i deem some searching bitters are 
 sweeter than sweets , and more refreshing far 
 and to be relished more , and more desired 
 and more to be pursued on eager feet 
 on feet untired , and still on feet though tired 

a cloud lay cradled near the setting sun 
 a gleam of crimson tinged its braided snow 
 long had i watched the glory moving on 
 o'er the still radiance of the lake below 
 tranquil its spirit seemed , and floated slow 
 even in its very motion there was rest 
 while every breath of eve that chanced to blow 
 wafted the traveller to the beauteous west 
 emblem , methought , of the departed soul 
 to whose white robe the gleam of bliss is given 
 and by the breath of mercy made to roll 
 right onwards to the golden gates of heaven 
 where to the eye of faith it peaceful lies 
 and tells to man his glorious destinies 

the spirit 's ark sealed with a little clay 
 was old ere memphis grew a memory 
 the hand pontifical to break away 
 that seal what shall surrender ? not the sea 
 which did englut great egypt and his war 
 nor all the desert drown ed sepulchres 
 love 's feet are stained with clay and travel sore 
 and dusty are song 's lucent wing and hairs 
 o love , that must do courtesy to decay 
 eat hasty bread standing with loins up girt 
 how shall this stead thy feet for their sore way 
 ah , song , what brief embraces balm thy hurt 
 had jacob 's toil full guerdon , casting his 
 twice seven heaped years to burn in rachel 's kiss 

so , as thou wert the seed and not the flower 
 having no form or comeliness , in chief 
 sharing thy thoughts with thine acquaintance grief 
 thou wert despised , rejected in thine hour 
 of loneliness and god triumphant power 
 oh , not three days alone , glad slumber brief 
 that from thy travail brought thee sweet relief 
 lay'st thou , outworn , beneath thy stony bower 
 but three and thirty years , a living seed 
 thy body lay as in a grave indeed 
 a heavenly germ dropt in a desert wide 
 buried in fallow soil of grief and need 
 ‘ mid earthquake storms of fiercest hate and pride 
 by woman 's tears bedewed and glorified 

lo ! in the west , fast fades the lingering light 
 and day 's last vestige takes its silent flight 
 no more is heard the woodman 's measured stroke 
 which with the dawn from yonder dingle broke 
 no more , hoarse clamouring o'er the uplifted head 
 the crows assembling seek their wind rock 'd bed 
 still 'd is the village hum — the woodland sounds 
 have ceased to echo o'er the dewy grounds 
 and general silence reigns , save when below 
 the murmuring trent is scarcely heard to flow 
 and save when , swung by ‘ nighted rustic late 
 oft , on its hinge , rebounds the jarring gate 
 or when the sheep bell , in the distant vale 
 breathes its wild music on the downy gale

the hour for which men hungered and had thirst 
 and dying were loth to die before it came 
 is it indeed upon thee ? and the lame 
 late foot of vengeance on thy trace accurst 
 for years insepulchred and crimes inhearsed 
 for days marked red or black with blood or shame 
 hath it outrun thee to tread out thy name 
 this scourge , this hour , is this indeed the worst 
 o clothed and crowned with curses , canst thou tell 
 have thy dead whispered to thee what they see 
 whose eyes are open in the dark on thee 
 ere spotted soul and body take farewell 
 or what of life beyond the worm 's may be

 the brazen pointed spear , with vigour thrown

 headlong he fell . next , thoas was thy chance 
 thy breast , unarm ’ d , received the spartan lance 
 phylides ’ dart ( as amphidus drew nigh 
 his blow prevented , and transpierced his thigh 
 tore all the brawn , and rent the nerves away 
 in darkness , and in death , the warrior lay 

while i gazed on that fair one 's cheek , a shade 
 of thought , or care , stole softly over 
 like that by a cloud in a summer 's day made 
 looking down on a field of blossoming clover 
 the rose yet lay on her cheek , but its flush 
 had something lost of its brilliant blush 
 and the light in her eye , and the light on the wheels 
 that marched so calmly round above her 
 was a little dimmed — as when evening steals 
 upon noon 's hot face :— yet one could n't but love her 
 for she looked like a mother whose first babe lay 
 rocked on her breast , as she swung all day 
 and she seemed in the same silver ’ tone to say 
 “ passing away ! passing away 

when i consider how my light is spent 
 ere half my days , in this dark world and wide 
 and that one talent , which is death to hide 
 lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent 
 to serve therewith my maker , and present 
 my true account , lest he , returning , chide 
 ‘ doth god exact day labour , light denied 
 i fondly ask . but patience , to prevent 
 that murmur , soon replies : ‘ god doth not need 
 either man 's work or his own gifts . who best 
 bear his mild yoke , they serve him best . his state 
 is kingly . thousands , at his bidding , speed 
 and post o'er land and ocean , without rest 
 they also serve who only stand and wait 

“ fair sir gan , ” the emperor spake 
 “ this my message to marsil take

 lead him to aix , to my royal seat 
 there to be tried and judged and slain 
 dying a death of disgrace and pain 
 i have sealed the scroll of my command

delight in your bright eyes my death did breed 
 as light and glittering weapons babes allure 
 to play with fire and sword , and so procure 
 then to be burnt and hurt ere they take heed

 thy beauty 's fame forever to endure

 because my heart to ashes burn è d giveth

i could not find the little maid content 
 so out i rushed , and sought her far and wide 
 but not where pleasure each new fancy tried 
 heading the maze of rioting merriment 
 nor where , with restless eyes and bow half bent 
 love in the brake of sweetbriar smiled and sighed 
 nor yet where fame towered , crowned and glorified 
 found i her face , nor wheresoe'er i went 
 so homeward back i crawled , like wounded bird 
 when lo ! content sate spinning at my door 
 and when i asked her where she was before 
 “ here all the time , ” she said ; “ i never stirred 
 too eager in thy search , you passed me o'er 
 and , though i called you , neither saw nor heard 

what were i , love , if i were stripped of thee 
 if thine eyes shut me out whereby i live 
 thou , who unto my calmer soul dost give 
 knowledge , and truth , and holy mystery 
 wherein truth mainly lies for those who see 
 beyond the earthly and the fugitive 
 who in the grandeur of the soul believe 
 and only in the infinite are free 
 without thee i were naked , bleak , and bare 
 as yon dead cedar on the sea cliff 's brow 
 and nature 's teachings , which come to me now 
 common and beautiful as light and air 
 would be as fruitless as a stream which still 
 slips through the wheel of some old ruined mill

 “ hey ! ” crieth phoebus , “ here be something new 
 thy song was wont to cheer me . what is this 
 “ by jove ! ” quoth corvus , “ i sing not amiss 
 phoebus , ” quoth he ; “ for all thy worthiness 
 for all thy beauty and all thy gentilesse 
 for all thy song and all thy minstrelsy

beyond the seas we know stretch seas unknown 
 blue and bright colored for our dim and green 
 beyond the lands we see , stretch lands unseen 
 with many tinted tangle overgrown 
 and icebound seas there are like seas of stone 
 serenely stormless as death lies serene 
 and lifeless tracks of sand , which intervene 
 betwixt the lands where living flowers are blown 
 this dead and living world befits our case 
 who live and die : we live in wearied hope 
 we die in hope not dead ; we run a race 
 to day , and find no present halting place 
 all things we see lie far within our scope 
 and still we peer beyond with craving face 

but first , by reason let me prove , i pray 
 that evil such as this , and which you say 
 oft weighs you down with soul corroding care 
 is only in the mind :— mere spright of air 
 your hat upon your head for instance place 
 less gently rather than 's your usual case 
 pray , do n't it presently at ease remain 
 and from it do you aught amiss retain 
 not e'en a spot ; there 's nothing half so clear 
 the features , too , they as before appear 
 no difference assuredly you see 
 then how can cuckoldom an evil be 
 such my conclusion , spite of fools or brutes 
 with whose ideas reason never suits 

to drift with every passion till my soul 
 is a stringed lute on which all winds can play 
 is it for this that i have given away 
 mine ancient wisdom , and austere control 
 methinks my life is a twice written scroll 
 scrawled over on some boyish holiday 
 with idle songs for pipe and virelay 
 which do but mar the secret of the whole 
 surely there was a time i might have trod 
 the sunlit heights , and from life 's dissonance 
 struck one clear chord to reach the ears of god 
 is that time dead ? lo ! with a little rod 
 i did but touch the honey of romance 
 and must i lose a soul 's inheritance 

to night the sea sends up a gulf like sound 
 and ancient rhymes are ringing in my head 
 the many lilts of song we sang and said 
 my friend and brother , when we journeyed round 
 our haunts at wollongong , that classic ground 
 for me at least , a lingerer deeply read 
 and steeped in beauty . oft in trance i tread 
 those shining shores , and hear your talk of fame 
 with thought flushed face and heart so well assured 
 ( beholding through the woodland 's bright distress 
 the moon half pillaged of her loveliness 
 of this wild dreamer : had you but endured 
 a dubious dark , you might have won a name 
 with brighter bays than i can ever claim 

the boy that goes to fodder with surprise 
 walks oer the gate he opened yesternight 
 the hedges all have vanished from his eyes 
 een some tree tops the sheep could reach to bite 
 the novel scene emboldens new delight 
 and , though with cautious steps his sports begin 
 he bolder shuffles the huge hills of snow 
 till down he drops and plunges to the chin 
 and struggles much and oft escape to win 
 then turns and laughs but dare not further go 
 for deep the grass and bushes lie below 
 where little birds that soon at eve went in 
 with heads tucked in their wings now pine for day 
 and little feel boys oer their heads can stray 

music to hear , why hear'st thou music sadly 
 sweets with sweets war not , joy delights in joy 
 why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly 
 or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy 
 if the true concord of well tuned sounds 
 by unions married do offend thine ear 
 they do but sweetly chide thee , who confounds 
 in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear 
 mark how one string sweet husband to another 
 strikes each in each by mutual ordering 
 resembling sire , and child , and happy mother 
 who all in one , one pleasing note do sing 
 whose speechless song being many , seeming one 
 sings this to thee , ‘ thou single wilt prove none 

raising my hopes on hills of high desire 
 thinking to scale the heaven of her heart 
 my slender means presumed too high a part 
 her thunder of disdain forced me retire 
 and threw me down to pain in all this fire 
 where lo , i languish in so heavy smart 
 because th'attempt was far above my art 
 her pride brooked not poor souls should come so nigh her 
 yet , i protest , my high desiring will 
 was not to dispossess her of her right 
 her sovereignty should have remain è d still 
 i only sought the bliss to have her sight 
 her sight , contented thus to see me spill 
 framed my desires fit for her eyes to kill 

o son of man , by lying tongues adored 
 by slaughterous hands of slaves with feet red shod 
 in carnage deep as ever christian trod 
 profaned with prayer and sacrifice abhorred 
 and incense from the trembling tyrant 's horde 
 brute worshippers or wielders of the rod 
 most murderous even of all that call thee god 
 most treacherous even that ever called thee lord 
 face loved of little children long ago 
 head hated of the priests and rulers then 
 if thou see this , or hear these hounds of thine 
 run ravening as the gadarean swine 
 say , was not this thy passion , to foreknow 
 in death 's worst hour the works of christian men 

‘ tis heaven — not man — must charm away the woe 
 which bursts when nature 's feelings newly flow 
 yet tenderness and time may rob the tear 
 of half its bitterness for one so dear 
 a nation 's gratitude perchance may spread 
 a thornless pillow for the widowed head 
 may lighten well her heart 's maternal care 
 and wean from penury the soldier 's heir 
 or deem to living war worn valour just 
 each wounded remnant — albion 's cherished trust 
 warm his decline with those endearing rays 
 whose bounteous sunshine yet may gild his days 
 so shall that country — while he sinks to rest 
 his hand hath fought for — by his heart be blest 

beauty and love let no one separate 
 whom exact nature did to each other fit 
 giving to beauty love as finishing fate 
 and to love beauty as true colour of it 
 let he but friend be who the soul finds fair 
 but let none love outside the body ’ s thought 
 so the seen couple ’ s togetherness shall bear 
 truth to the beauty each in the other sought 
 i could but love thee out of mockery 
 of love and thee and mine own ugliness 
 therefore thy beauty i sing and wish not thee 
 thanking the gods i long not out of place 
 lest , like a slave that for kings ’ robes doth long 
 obtained , shall with mere wearing do them wrong 

seeing the gods — why chafe at them 
 have placed thee here , to share within these walls 
 our lustral waters , ‘ mid a crowd of thralls 
 who stand obedient round the altar stone 
 of our possession . therefore come thou down 
 and be not over proud . the tale is told 
 how once alcmena 's son himself , being sold 
 was patient , though he liked not the slaves ’ mess 
 and more , if fate must bring thee to this stress 
 praise god thou art come to a house of high report 
 and wealth from long ago . the baser sort 
 who have reaped some sudden harvest unforeseen 
 are ever cruel to their slaves , and mean 
 in the measure . we shall give whate'er is due 

by the fond name that was his own and mine 
 the last upon his lips that strove with doom 
 he called me and i saw the light assume 
 a sudden glory and around him shine 
 and nearer now i saw the laureled line 
 of the august of song before me loom 
 and knew the voices , erstwhile through the gloom 
 that whispered and forbade me to repine 
 and with farewell , a shaft of splendor sank 
 out of the stars and faded as a flame 
 and down the night , on clouds of glory , came 
 the battle seraphs halting rank on rank 
 and lifted heavenward to heroic peace 
 he passed and left me hope beyond surcease 

thou radiant coachman , running endless course 
 fountain of heat , of light the lively source 
 life of the world , lamp of this universe 
 heaven 's richest gem : oh , teach me where my verse 
 may but begin thy praise : alas ! i fare 
 much like to one that in the clouds doth stare 
 to count the quails , that with their shadow cover 
 the italian sea , when soaring hither over 
 fain of a milder and more fruitful clime 
 they come with us to pass the summer time 
 no sooner he begins one shoal to sum 
 but , more and more , still greater shoals do come 
 swarm upon swarm , that with their countless number 
 break off his purpose , and his sense encumber

 are heard resounding with a hundred rills

what can i give thee back , o liberal 
 and princely giver , who hast brought the gold 
 and purple of thine heart , unstained , untold 
 and laid them on the outside of the wall 
 for such as i to take or leave withal 
 in unexpected largesse ? am i cold 
 ungrateful , that for these most manifold 
 high gifts , i render nothing back at all 
 not so ; not cold ,— but very poor instead 
 ask god who knows . for frequent tears have run 
 the colours from my life , and left so dead 
 and pale a stuff , it were not fitly done 
 to give the same as pillow to thy head 
 go farther ! let it serve to trample on 

homes of our sires , where learning 's temple rose 
 while vet they struggled with their banded foes 
 as in the west thy century 's sun descends 
 one parting gleam its dying radiance lends 
 darker and deeper though the shadows fall 
 from the gray towers on doubting castle 's wall 
 though pope and pagan re array their hosts 
 and her new armor youthful science boasts 
 truth , for whose altar rose this holy shrine 
 shall fly for refuge to these bowers of thine 
 no past shall chain her with its rusted vow 
 no jew 's phylactery bind her christian brow 
 but faith shall smile to find her sister free 
 and nobler manhood draw its life from thee 

in token of the love which thou hast shown 
 for this wide land of freedom , i have named 
 a province vast , and for its beauty famed 
 by thy dear name to be hereafter known 
 alberta shall it be ! her fountains thrown 
 from alps unto three oceans , to all men 
 shall vaunt her loveliness e'en now ; and when 
 each little hamlet to a city grown 
 and numberless as blades of prairie grass 
 or the thick leaves in distant forest bower 
 great peoples hear the giant currents pass 
 still shall the waters , bringing wealth and power 
 speak the loved name ,— the land of silver springs 
 worthy the daughter of our english kings 

behold in awful march and dread array 
 the long extended squadrons shape their way 
 death , in approaching terrible , imparts 
 an anxious horror to the bravest hearts 
 yet do their beating breasts demand the strife 
 and thirst of glory quells the love of life 
 no vulgar fears can british minds control 
 heat of revenge and noble pride of soul 
 o'er look the foe , advantaged by his post 
 lessen his numbers , and contract his host 
 though fens and floods possessed the middle space 
 that unprovoked they would have feared to pass 
 nor fens nor floods can stop britannia 's bands 
 when her proud foe ranged on their borders stands 

throughout the echoing chambers of my brain 
 i hear your words in mournful cadence toll 
 like some slow passing bell which warns the soul 
 of sundering darkness . unrelenting , fain 
 to batter down resistance , fall again 
 stroke after stroke , insistent diastole 
 the bitter blows of truth , until the whole 
 is hammered into fact made strangely plain 
 where shall i look for comfort ? not to you 
 our worlds are drawn apart , our spirit 's suns 
 divided , and the light of mine burnt dim 
 now in the haunted twilight i must do 
 your will . i grasp the cup which over runs 
 and with my trembling lips i touch the rim 

much have i travelled in the realms of gold 
 and many goodly states and kingdoms seen 
 round many western islands have i been 
 which bards in fealty to apollo hold 
 oft of one wide expanse had i been told 
 that deep browed homer ruled as his demesne 
 yet never did i breathe its pure serene 
 till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold 
 then felt i like some watcher of the skies 
 when a new planet swims into his ken 
 or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes 
 he stared at the pacific — and all his men 
 looked at each other with a wild surmise 
 silent , upon a peak in darien

‘ tis best sometimes your censure to restrain 
 and charitably let the dull be vain 
 your silence there is better than your spite 
 for who can rail so long as they can write 
 still humming on , their drowsy course they keep 
 and lashed so long like tops are lashed asleep 
 false steps but help them to renew the race 
 as after stumbling , jades will mend their pace 
 what crowds of these , impenitently bold 
 in sounds and jingling syllables grown old 
 still run on poets in a raging vein 
 even to the dregs and squeezing of the brain 
 strain out the last dull droppings of their sense 
 and rhyme with all the rage of impotence 

no voice is heard , for man has fled the place 
 but terror crouches in the corners ’ space 
 and waits the coming guest . this banquet hall 
 of titans is so high , that he who shall 
 with wandering eye look up from beam to beam 
 of the confused wild roof will haply seem 
 to wonder that the stars he sees not there 
 giants the spiders are , that weave with care 
 their hideous webs , which float the joists amid 
 joists whose dark ends in griffins ’ jaws are hid 
 the light is lurid , and the air like death 
 and dark and foul . even night holds its breath 
 awhile . one might suppose the door had fear 
 to move its double leaves — their noise to hear 

how sweet to be thus nestling deep in boughs 
 upon an ashen stoven pillowing me 
 faintly are heard the ploughmen at their ploughs 
 but not an eye can find its way to see 
 the sunbeams scarce molest me with a smile 
 so thickly the leafy armies gather round 
 and where they do , the breeze blows cool the while 
 their leafy shadows dancing on the ground 
 full many a flower , too , wishing to be seen 
 perks up its head the hiding grass between 
 in mid wood silence , thus , how sweet to be 
 where all the noises , that on peace intrude 
 come from the chittering cricket , bird , and bee 
 whose songs have charms to sweeten solitude 

with lyre orphean , see a bard explore 
 the central caverns of the mornless night 
 where never muse perform 'd harmonious rite 
 till now !— and lo ! upon the sparry floor 
 advance , to welcome him , each sister power

 and call their gnomes , to marshal in his sight 
 the gelid incrust , and the veined ore 
 and flashing gem .— then , while his songs pourtray

 and hedge me in from the disconsolate hills

 enough of ocean in its voice i hear

 in nature 's inmost heart is no uproar 
 none in this shrine ; in peace the heavens roll 
 in peace the slow tides pulse from shore to shore 
 and ancient quiet broods from pole to pole 

but you who take the city for your own 
 come with me when the night flows deep and kind 
 along these narrow ways of troubled stone 
 and floods the wide savannas of the mind 
 with tides that cool the fever of the day 
 one with the dark , companioned by the stars 
 we 'll seek st. philip 's , nebulous and gray 
 holding its throbbing beacon to the bars 
 a prisoned spirit vibrant in the stone 
 that knew its empire of forgotten things 
 then will the city know you for her own 
 and feel you meet to share her sufferings 
 while down a swirl of poignant memories 
 herself shall find you in her silences 

how languisheth the primrose of love 's garden 
 how trill her tears , th ’ elixir of my senses 
 ambitious sickness , what doth thee so harden 
 oh spare , and plague thou me for her offences 
 ah roses , love 's fair roses , do not languish 
 blush through the milk white veil that holds you covered 
 if heat or cold may mitigate your anguish 
 i 'll burn , i 'll freeze , but you shall be recovered 
 good god , would beauty mark now she is crased 
 how but one shower of sickness makes her tender 
 her judgments then to mark my woes amazed 
 to mercy should opinion 's fort surrender 
 and i ,— oh would i might , or would she meant it 
 should hery [ a ] love , who now in heart lament it 

the woman singeth at her spinning wheel 
 a pleasant chant , ballad , or baracolle 
 she thinketh of her song , upon the whole 
 far more than of her flax ; and yet the reel 
 is full , and artfully her fingers feel 
 with quick adjustment , provident control 
 the lines , too subtly twisted to unroll 
 out to a perfect thread . i hence appeal 
 to the dear christian church , that we may do 
 our father 's business in these temples mirk 
 thus , swift and steadfast ; thus , intent and strong 
 while , thus , apart from toil , our souls pursue 
 some high , calm , spheric tune and prove our work 
 the better for the sweetness of our song 

with all the fairest angels nearest god 
 the ineffable true of heart around the throne 
 there shall i find you waiting when the flown 
 dream leaves my heart insentient as the clod 
 and when the grief retracing ways i trod 
 become a shining path to thee alone 
 my weary feet , that seemed to drag as stone 
 shall once again , with wings of fleetness shod 
 fare on , beloved , to find you ! just beyond 
 the seraph throng await me , standing near 
 the gentler angels , eager and apart 
 be there , near god 's own fairest , with the fond 
 sweet smile that was your own , and let me hear 
 your voice again and clasp you to my heart 

arm ! arm ! that mandate on each wind is whirled 
 let no man hesitate or look askance 
 for from the devastated homes of france 
 and ruined belgium the cry is hurled 
 why , christ himself would keep peace banners furled 
 were he among us , till , with lifted lance 
 he saw the hosts of righteousness advance 
 to purify the temples of the world 
 there is no safety on the earth to day 
 for any sacred thing , or clean , or fair 
 nor can there be , until men rise and slay 
 the hydra headed monster in his lair 
 war ! horrid war ! now virtue 's only friend 
 clasp hands with war , and battle to the end 

he spoke abrupt across my dream : “ dear garden 
 a stranger to your magic peace , i stand 
 beyond your walls , lost in a fevered land 
 of stones and fire . would that the gods would harden 
 my soul against its torment , or would blind 
 those yearning glimpses of a life at rest 
 in perfect beauty — glimpses at the best 
 through unpassed bars . and here , without , the wind 
 of scattering passion blows : and women pass 
 glitter eyed down putrid alleys where the glass 
 of some grimed window suddenly parades 
 ah , sickening heart beat of desire !— the grace 
 of bare and milk warm flesh : the vision fades 
 and at the pane shows a blind tortured face 

ye too , dim watchfires of some darkling hour 
 whose fame forlorn time saves not nor proclaims 
 for ever , but forgetfulness defames 
 and darkness and the shadow of death devour 
 lift up ye too your light , put forth your power 
 let the far twilight feel your soft small flames 
 and smile , albeit night name not even their names 
 ghost by ghost passing , flower blown down on flower 
 that sweet tongued shadow , like a star 's that passed 
 singing , and light was from its darkness cast 
 to paint the face of painting fair with praise 
 and that wherein forefigured smiles the pure 
 fraternal face of wordsworth 's elidure 
 between two child faced masks of merrier days 

like memnon 's rock , touched with the rising sun 
 which yields a sound and echoes forth a voice 
 but when it 's drowned in western seas is done 
 and drowsy like leaves off to make a noise 
 so i , my love , enlightened with your shine 
 a poet 's skill within my soul i shroud 
 not rude like that which finer wits decline 
 but such as muses to the best allowed 
 but when your figure and your shape is gone 
 i speechless am like as i was before 
 or if i write , my verse is filled with moan 
 and blurred with tears by falling in such store 
 then muse not , licia , if my muse be slack 
 for when i wrote i did thy beauty lack 

“ the angels , o my brother ! and this clime 
 wherein thou art , impassible and pure 
 i call created , as indeed they are 
 in their whole being . but the elements 
 which thou hast nam 'd , and what of them is made 
 are by created virtue ’ inform 'd : create 
 their substance , and create the ’ informing virtue 
 in these bright stars , that round them circling move 
 the soul of every brute and of each plant 
 the ray and motion of the sacred lights 
 with complex potency attract and turn 
 but this our life the ’ eternal good inspires 
 immediate , and enamours of itself 
 so that our wishes rest for ever here 

that time of life thou mayst in me behold 
 when yellow leaves , or none , or few do hang 
 upon those boughs which shake against the cold 
 bare ruin 'd choirs , where late the sweet birds sang 
 in me thou see'st the twilight of such day 
 as after sunset fadeth in the west 
 which by and by black night doth take away 
 death 's second self , that seals up all in rest 
 in me thou see'st the glowing of such fire 
 that on the ashes of his youth doth lie 
 as the death bed whereon it must expire 
 consumed with that which it was nourished by 
 this thou perceivest , which makes thy love more strong 
 to love that well which thou must leave ere long 

must all of worth be travailled for , and those 
 life 's brightest stars rise from a troubled sea 
 must years go by in sad uncertainty 
 leaving us doubting whose the conquering blows 
 are we or fate the victors ? time which shows 
 all inner meanings will reveal , but we 
 shall never know the upshot . ours to be 
 wasted with longing , shattered in the throes 
 the agonies of splendid dreams , which day 
 dims from our vision , but each night brings back 
 we strive to hold their grandeur , and essay 
 to be the thing we dream . sudden we lack 
 the flash of insight , life grows drear and gray 
 and hour follows hour , nerveless , slack 

“ behold the prizes , valiant greeks ! decreed 
 to the brave rulers of the racing steed 
 prizes which none beside ourself could gain 
 should our immortal coursers take the plain 
 ( a race unrivall ’ d , which from ocean ’ s god 
 peleus received , and on his son bestow ’ d 
 but this no time our vigour to display 
 nor suit , with them , the games of this sad day 
 lost is patroclus now , that wont to deck 
 their flowing manes , and sleek their glossy neck 
 sad , as they shared in human grief , they stand 
 and trail those graceful honours on the sand 
 let others for the noble task prepare 
 who trust the courser and the flying car 

“ not all ” — the echoes answer me — “ not all 
 “ prophetic sounds and loud , arise forever 
 “ from us , and from all ruin , unto the wise 
 “ as melody from memnon to the sun 
 “ we rule the hearts of mightiest men — we rule 
 “ with a despotic sway all giant minds 
 “ we are not impotent — we pallid stones 
 “ not all our power is gone — not all our fame 
 “ not all the magic of our high renown 
 “ not all the wonder that encircles us 
 “ not all the mysteries that in us lie 
 “ not all the memories that hang upon 
 “ and cling around about us as a garment 
 “ clothing us in a robe of more than glory 

friend , whom thy fourscore winters leave more dear 
 than when life 's roseate summer on thy cheek 
 burned in the flush of manhood 's manliest year 
 lonely , how lonely ! is the snowy peak 
 thy feet have reached , and mine have climbed so near 
 close on thy footsteps ‘ mid the landscape drear 
 i stretch my hand thine answering grasp to seek 
 warm with the love no rippling rhymes can speak 
 look backward ! from thy lofty height survey 
 thy years of toil , of peaceful victories won 
 of dreams made real , largest hopes outrun 
 look forward ! brighter than earth 's morning ray 
 streams the pure light of heaven 's unsetting sun 
 the unclouded dawn of life 's immortal day 

o child of mine , my little son , alas 
 beneath the sunlight of thy gentle eyes 
 too soon , too soon , what fateful shadows rise 
 like night foretold in some sweet woodland glass 
 on tender feet that scarcely bow the grass 
 what stains are those of ripe pomegranate dyes 
 when on my breast thy head in slumber lies 
 what thorns are those that through my heart do pass 
 and round about these crowds of haunting forms 
 that burn their splendor through my dimmest dreams 
 o little child , thou wonder too divine 
 thy precious body all my bosom warms 
 with mine own blood , but oftentimes it seems 
 too dearly loved ,— that yet thou art not mine 

long hath my sufferance laboured to enforce 
 one pearl of pity from her pretty eyes 
 whilst i with restless rivers of remorse 
 have bathed the banks where my fair phillis lies 
 the moaning lines which weeping i have written 
 and writing read unto my ruthful sheep 
 and reading sent with tears that never fitten 
 to my love 's queen , that hath my heart in keep 
 have made my lambkins lay them down and sigh 
 but phillis sits , and reads , and calls them trifles 
 oh heavens , why climb not happy lines so high 
 to rent that ruthless heart that all hearts rifles 
 none writes with truer faith , or greater love 
 yet out , alas ! i have no power to move 

“ andromache ! my soul ’ s far better part 
 why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart 
 no hostile hand can antedate my doom 
 till fate condemns me to the silent tomb 
 fix ’ d is the term to all the race of earth 
 and such the hard condition of our birth 
 no force can then resist , no flight can save 
 all sink alike , the fearful and the brave 
 no more — but hasten to thy tasks at home 
 there guide the spindle , and direct the loom 
 me glory summons to the martial scene 
 the field of combat is the sphere for men 
 where heroes war , the foremost place i claim 
 the first in danger as the first in fame 

‘ my friends , ’ he cried ( and cast a mournful look 
 around the room , and sigh 'd before he spoke 
 ‘ beneath the weight of threescore years i bend 
 and , worn with cares , am hastening to my end 
 how i have lived , alas ! you know too well 
 in worldly follies which i blush to tell 
 but gracious heaven has oped my eyes at last 
 with due regret i view my vices past 
 and , as the precept of the church decrees 
 will take a wife , and live in holy ease 
 but since by counsel all things should be done 
 and many heads are wiser still than one 
 choose you for me , who best shall be content 
 when my desire 's approved by your consent 

when from the prison of its body free 
 my soul shall soar , before it goes to thee 
 thou great creator , give it power to know 
 the language of all sad , dumb things below 
 and let me dwell a season still on earth 
 before i rise to some diviner birth 
 invisible to men , yet seen and heard 
 and understood by sorrowing beast and bird   
 invisible to men , yet always near 
 to whisper counsel in the human ear 
 and with a spell to stay the hunter 's hand 
 and stir his heart to know and understand 
 to plant within the dull or thoughtless mind 
 the great religious impulse to be kind 

o happy thames , that didst my stella bear 
 i saw thee with full many a smiling line 
 upon thy cheerful face joy 's livery wear 
 while those fair planets on thy streams did shine 
 the boat for joy could not to dance forbear 
 while wanton winds , with beauties so divine 
 ravish 'd , stay 'd not , till in her golden hair 
 they did themselves ( o sweetest prison !) twine 
 and fain those oeol 's youth there would their stay 
 have made ; but , forced by nature still to fly 
 first did with puffing kiss those locks display 
 she , so dishevell 'd , blush 'd . from window i 
 with sight thereof , cried out , ‘ o fair disgrace 
 let honour 's self to thee grant highest place 

man 's heel is on the almighty 's neck who said 
 let there be hell , and there was hell — on earth 
 but not for that may men forget their worth 
 nay , but much more remember them — who led 
 the living first from dwellings of the dead 
 and rent the cerecloths that were wont to engirth 
 souls wrapped and swathed and swaddled from their birth 
 with lies that bound them fast from heel to head 
 among the tombs when wise men all their lives 
 dwelt , and cried out , and cut themselves with knives 
 these men , being foolish , and of saints abhorred 
 beheld in heaven the sun by saints reviled 
 love , and on earth one everlasting lord 
 in every likeness of a little child 

methinks i see thee , lying calm and low 
 silent and dark within thy earthy bed 
 thy mighty hands , in which i trusted , dead 
 resting , with thy long arms , from work or blow 
 and the night robe , around thy tall form , flow 
 down from the kingly face , and from the head 
 save by its thick dark curls , uncovered 
 my brother , dear from childhood , lying so 
 not often since thou went'st , i think of thee 
 ( with inward cares and questionings oppressed 
 and yet , ere long , i seek thee in thy rest 
 and bring thee home my heart , as full , as free 
 as sure that thou wilt take me tenderly 
 as then when youth and nature made us blest 

in that proud port which her so goodly graceth 
 whiles her faire face she reares up to the skie

 most goodly temperature ye may descry

 for , looking on the earth whence she was borne 
 her minde remembreth her mortalitie 
 whatso is fayrest shall to earth returne 
 but that same lofty countenance seemes to scorne 
 base thing , and thinke how she to heaven may clime 
 treading downe earth as lothsome and forlorne

we are met , this moonlight , for momentous councils 
 concerning those two drowsy human lovers 
 maid marian and her outlawed robin hood 
 they are in dire peril ; yet we may not break 
 our vows of silence . many a time 
 has robin hood by kindly words and deeds 
 done in his human world , sent a new breath 
 of life and joy like spring to fairyland 
 and at the moth hour of this very dew fall 
 he saved a fairy , whom he thought , poor soul 
 only a may fly in a spider 's web 
 he saved her from the clutches of that wizard 
 that cruel thing , that dark old mystery 
 whom ye all know and shrink from 

so many a year had borne its own bright bees 
 and slain them since thy honey bees were hived 
 john day , in cells of flower sweet verse contrived 
 so well with craft of moulding melodies 
 thy soul perchance in amaranth fields at ease 
 thought not to hear the sound on earth revived 
 of summer music from the spring derived 
 when thy song sucked the flower of flowering trees 
 but thine was not the chance of every day 
 time , after many a darkling hour , grew sunny 
 and light between the clouds ere sunset swam 
 laughing , and kissed their darkness all away 
 when , touched and tasted and approved , thy honey 
 took subtler sweetness from the lips of lamb 

my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still 
 while comments of your praise richly compiled 
 reserve their character with golden quill 
 and precious phrase by all the muses filed 
 i think good thoughts , whilst other write good words 
 and like unlettered clerk still cry amen 
 to every hymn that able spirit affords 
 in polished form of well refined pen 
 hearing you praised , i say ‘ tis so , ‘ tis true 
 and to the most of praise add something more 
 but that is in my thought , whose love to you 
 ( though words come hindmost ) holds his rank before 
 then others , for the breath of words respect 
 me for my dumb thoughts , speaking in effect 

most men know love but as a part of life 
 they hide it in some corner of the breast 
 even from themselves ; and only when they rest 
 in the brief pauses of that daily strife 
 wherewith the world might else be not so rife 
 they draw it forth ( as one draws forth a toy 
 to soothe some ardent , kiss exacting boy 
 and hold it up to sister , child , or wife 
 ah me ! why may not love and life be one 
 why walk we thus alone , when by our side 
 love , like a visible god , might be our guide 
 how would the marts grow noble ! and the street 
 worn like a dungeon floor by weary feet 
 seem then a golden court way of the sun 

long having deeply gron 'd these visions sad 
 i saw a citie like unto that same 
 which saw the messenger of tidings glad 
 but that on sand was built the goodly frame 
 it seem 'd her top the firmament did rayse 
 and , no lesse rich than faire , right worthie sure 
 ( if ought here worthie ) of immortall dayes 
 or if ought under heaven might firme endure 
 much wondred i to see so faire a wall 
 when from the northerns coast a storme arose 
 which , breathing furie from his inward gall 
 on all which did against his course oppose 
 into a clowde of dust sperst in the aire 
 the weake foundations of this citie faire 

it one day happened , that this forward spark 
 the girl we speak of , met within the park 
 and to a summer house the fav'rite drew 
 the course they took the princess chanced to view 
 as wand'ring near ; but neither swain nor fair 
 suspicion had , that any one was there 
 and this gallant most confidently thought 
 the girl by force , might to his terms be brought 
 his wretched temper , obstacle to love 
 and ev'ry bliss bestowed by heav'n above 
 had oft his hopes of favours lately marred 
 and fear , with those designs , had also jarred 
 the girl , howe'er , would likely have been kind 
 if opportunities had pleased her mind 

beloved , my beloved , when i think 
 that thou wast in the world a year ago 
 what time i sat alone here in the snow 
 and saw no footprint , heard the silence sink 
 no moment at thy voice , but , link by link 
 went counting all my chains as if that so 
 they never could fall off at any blow 
 struck by thy possible hand ,— why , thus i drink 
 of life 's great cup of wonder ! wonderful 
 never to feel thee thrill the day or night 
 with personal act or speech ,— nor ever cull 
 some prescience of thee with the blossoms white 
 thou sawest growing ! atheists are as dull 
 who cannot guess god 's presence out of sight 

i 've called you father , praised your royal grace 
 behind your back as well as to your face 
 you 've owned i have a conscience : try me now 
 if i can quit your gifts with cheerful brow 
 that was a prudent answer which , we 're told 
 the son of wise ulysses made of old 
 “ our ithaca is scarce the place for steeds 
 it has no level plains , no grassy meads 
 atrides , if you 'll let me , i 'll decline 
 a gift that better meets your wants than mine 
 small things become small folks : imperial rome 
 is all too large , too bustling for a home 
 the empty heights of tibur , or the bay 
 of soft tarentum , more are in my way 

the almighty thunderer with a frown replies 
 that clouds the world , and blackens half the skies 
 “ strong god of ocean ! thou , whose rage can make 
 the solid earth ’ s eternal basis shake 
 what cause of fear from mortal works could move 
 the meanest subject of our realms above 
 where ’ er the sun ’ s refulgent rays are cast 
 thy power is honour ’ d , and thy fame shall last 
 but yon proud work no future age shall view 
 no trace remain where once the glory grew 
 the sapp ’ d foundations by thy force shall fall 
 and , whelm ’ d beneath the waves , drop the huge wall 
 vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore 
 the ruin vanish ’ d , and the name no more 

thus can my love excuse the slow offence 
 of my dull bearer , when from thee i speed 
 from where thou art , why should i haste me thence 
 till i return of posting is no need 
 o what excuse will my poor beast then find 
 when swift extremity can seem but slow 
 then should i spur though mounted on the wind 
 in winged speed no motion shall i know 
 then can no horse with my desire keep pace 
 therefore desire ( of perfect'st love being made 
 shall neigh ( no dull flesh ) in his fiery race 
 but love , for love , thus shall excuse my jade 
 since from thee going , he went wilful slow 
 towards thee i 'll run , and give him leave to go 

waves trough , rebound , and furious boil again 
 like plunging monsters rising underneath 
 who at the top curl up a shaggy mane 
 a moment catching at a surer breath 
 then plunging headlong down and down , and on 
 each following whirls the shadow of the last 
 and other monsters rise when those are gone 
 crest their fringed waves , plunge onward and are past 
 the chill air comes around me oceanly 
 from bank to bank the waterstrife is spread 
 strange birds like snowspots oer the whizzing sea 
 hang where the wild duck hurried past and fled 
 on roars the flood , all restless to be free 
 like trouble wandering to eternity 

ah , well for him if here his suff'rings ceas 'd 
 and ample hours of rest his pains appeas 'd 
 but rous 'd again , and sternly bade to rise 
 and shake refreshing slumber from his eyes 
 ere his exhausted spirits can return 
 or through his frame reviving ardour burn 
 come forth he must , tho ’ limping , maim 'd , and sore 
 he hears the whip ; the chaise is at the door 
 the collar tightens , and again he feels 
 his half heal 'd wounds inflam 'd ; again the wheels 
 with tiresome sameness in his ears resound 
 o'er blinding dust , or miles of flinty ground 
 thus nightly robb 'd , and injur 'd day by day 
 his piece meal murd'rers wear his life away 

father of nations ! help of the feeble hand 
 strength of the strong ! to whom the nations kneel 
 stay and destroyer , at whose just command 
 earth 's kingdoms tremble and her empires reel 
 who dost the low uplift , the small make great 
 and dost abase the ignorantly proud 
 of our scant people mould a mighty state 
 to the strong , stern ,— to thee in meekness bowed 
 father of unity , make this people one 
 weld , interfuse them in the patriot 's flame 
 whose forging on thine anvil was begun 
 in blood late shed to purge the common shame 
 that so our hearts , the fever of faction done 
 banish old feud in our young nation 's name 

and , as a savage boar , on mountains bred 
 with forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed 
 when once he sees himself in toils inclos 'd 
 by huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd  
 he whets his tusks , and turns , and dares the war 
 th ’ invaders dart their jav'lins from afar 
 all keep aloof , and safely shout around 
 but none presumes to give a nearer wound 
 he frets and froths , erects his bristled hide 
 and shakes a grove of lances from his side 
 not otherwise the troops , with hate inspir 'd 
 and just revenge against the tyrant fir 'd 
 their darts with clamor at a distance drive 
 and only keep the languish 'd war alive 

lo , the poor indian ! whose untutor 'd mind 
 sees god in clouds , or hears him in the wind 
 his soul , proud science never taught to stray 
 far as the solar walk , or milky way 
 yet simple nature to his hope has giv'n 
 behind the cloud topt hill , an humbler heav'n 
 some safer world in depth of woods embrac 'd 
 some happier island in the watry waste 
 where slaves once more their native land behold 
 no fiends torment , no christians thirst for gold 
 to be , contents his natural desire 
 he asks no angel 's wing , no seraph 's fire 
 but thinks , admitted to that equal sky 
 his faithful dog shall bear him company 

river , that stealest with such silent pace 
 around the city of the dead , where lies 
 a friend who bore thy name , and whom these eyes 
 shall see no more in his accustomed place 
 linger and fold him in thy soft embrace 
 and say good night , for now the western skies 
 are red with sunset , and gray mists arise 
 like damps that gather on a dead man 's face 
 good night ! good night ! as we so oft have said 
 beneath this roof at midnight in the days 
 that are no more , and shall no more return 
 thou hast but taken thy lamp and gone to bed 
 i stay a little longer , as one stays 
 to cover up the embers that still burn 

another battle ! and the sounds have rolled 
 by many a gloomy gorge and wasted plain 
 o'er huddled hills and mountains manifold 
 like winds that run before a heavy rain 
 when autumn lops the leaves and drooping grain 
 and earth lies deep in brown and cloudy gold 
 my brothers , lo ! our grand old england stands 
 with weapons gleaming in her ready hands 
 outside the tumult ! let us watch and trust 
 that she will never darken in the dust 
 and drift of wild contention , but remain 
 the hope and stay of many troubled lands 
 where so she waits the issue of the fight 
 aloof ; but praying “ god defend the right 

the bold bavarian , in a luckless hour 
 tries the dread summits of cesarean pow'r 
 with unexpected legions bursts away 
 and sees defenceless realms receive his sway 
 short sway ! fair austria spreads her mournful charms 
 the queen , the beauty , sets the world in arms 
 from hill to hill the beacons rousing blaze 
 spreads wide the hope of plunder and of praise 
 the fierce croatian , and the wild hussar 
 and all the sons of ravage croud the war 
 the baffled prince in honour 's flatt'ring bloom 
 of hasty greatness finds the fatal doom 
 his foes derision , and his subjects blame 
 and steals to death from anguish and from shame 

sin of self love possesseth all mine eye 
 and all my soul , and all my every part 
 and for this sin there is no remedy 
 it is so grounded inward in my heart 
 methinks no face so gracious is as mine 
 no shape so true , no truth of such account 
 and for my self mine own worth do define 
 as i all other in all worths surmount 
 but when my glass shows me my self indeed 
 beated and chopt with tanned antiquity 
 mine own self love quite contrary i read 
 self , so self loving were iniquity 
 ‘ tis thee ( my self ) that for my self i praise 
 painting my age with beauty of thy days 

though night approaching bids for rest prepare 
 still the flail echoes through the frosty air 
 nor stops till deepest shades of darkness come 
 sending at length the weary laborer home 
 from him , with bed and nightly food supplied 
 throughout the yard , hous 'd round on every side 
 deep plunging cows their rustling feast enjoy 
 and snatch sweet mouthfuls from the passing boy 
 who moves unseen beneath his trailing load 
 fills the tall racks , and leaves a scatter 'd road 
 where oft the swine from ambush warm and dry 
 bolt out , and scamper headlong to their sty 
 when giles with well known voice , already there 
 deigns them a portion of his evening care 

what artful hand the wretch 's form can hit 
 begot by satan on a m —— ly 's wit 
 in parties furious at the great man 's nod 
 and hating none for nothing , but his god 
 foe to the learn 'd , the virtuous , and the sage 
 a pimp in youth , an atheist in old age 
 now plung 'd in bawdry and substantial lyes 
 now dab'ling in ungodly theories 
 but so , as swallows skim the pleasing flood 
 grows giddy , but ne'er drinks to do him good 
 alike resolv 'd to flatter , or to cheat 
 nay worship onions , if they cry , come eat 
 a foe to faith , in revelation blind 
 and impious much , as dunces are by kind 

give me the treble of thy horns and hoofs 
 the ponderous undertones of ‘ bus and tram 
 a garret and a glimpse across the roofs 
 of clouds blown eastward over notre dame 
 the glad eyed streets and radiant gatherings 
 where i drank deep the bliss of being young 
 the strife and sweet potential flux of things 
 i sought youth 's dream of happiness among 
 it walks here aureoled with the city light 
 forever through the myriad featured mass 
 flaunting not far its fugitive embrace 
 heard sometimes in a song across the night 
 caught in a perfume from the crowds that pass 
 and when love yields to love seen face to face 

if thou hadst been a painter , what fresh looks 
 what shining of pent glories , what new grace 
 had burst upon us from the great earth 's face 
 how had we read , as in new languaged books 
 clear love of god in lone retreating nooks 
 a lily , as thy hand its form would trace 
 were plainly seen god 's child , of lower race 
 and , o my heart , blue hills ! and grassy brooks 
 thy soul lay to all undulations bare 
 answering in waves . each morn the sun did rise 
 and god 's world woke beneath life giving skies 
 thou sawest clear thy father 's meanings there 
 ‘ mid earth 's ideal , and expressions rare 
 the ideal man , with the eternal eyes 

them virgil answer 'd . “ ye suppose perchance 
 us well acquainted with this place : but here

 the ’ ascent will seem to us as play . ” the spirits 
 who from my breathing had perceiv 'd i liv 'd 
 grew pale with wonder . as the multitude 
 flock round a herald , sent with olive branch 
 to hear what news he brings , and in their haste 
 tread one another down , e'en so at sight 
 of me those happy spirits were fix 'd , each one 
 forgetful of its errand , to depart 
 where cleans 'd from sin , it might be made all fair 

yes , fled already is thy vital fire 
 and the fair promise of thy early bloom 
 lost , in youth 's morn extinct ; sunk in the tomb 
 mute in the grave sleeps thy enchanted lyre 
 and is it vainly that our souls aspire 
 falsely does the presaging heart presume 
 that we shall live beyond life 's cares and gloom 
 grasps it eternity with high desire 
 but to imagine bliss , feel woe , and die 
 leaving survivors to worse pangs than death 
 not such the sanction of the eternal mind 
 the harmonious order of the starry sky 
 and awful revelation 's angel breath 
 assure these hopes their full effect shall find 

the frog half fearful jumps across the path 
 and little mouse that leaves its hole at eve 
 nimbles with timid dread beneath the swath 
 my rustling steps awhile their joys deceive 
 till past ,— and then the cricket sings more strong 
 and grasshoppers in merry moods still wear 
 the short night weary with their fretting song 
 up from behind the molehill jumps the hare 
 cheat of his chosen bed , and from the bank 
 the yellowhammer flutters in short fears 
 from off its nest hid in the grasses rank 
 and drops again when no more noise it hears 
 thus nature 's human link and endless thrall 
 proud man , still seems the enemy of all 

upon a cloud among the stars we stood 
 the angel raised his hand and looked and said 
 “ which world , of all yon starry myriad 
 shall we make wing to ? ” the still solitude 
 became a harp whereon his voice and mood 
 made spheral music round his haloed head 
 i spake — for then i had not long been dead 
 “ let me look round upon the vasts , and brood 
 a moment on these orbs ere i decide 
 what is yon lower star that beauteous shines 
 and with soft splendour now incarnadines 
 our wings ? — there would i go and there abide 
 then he as one who some child 's thought divines 
 “ that is the world where yesternight you died 

how thick the clouds of night are rang 'd o'er head 
 confounding darkness o'er the earth is spread 
 the clouded moon her cheering count'nance hides 
 and feeble stars , between the ragged sides 
 of broken clouds , with unavailing ray 
 look thro ’ to mock the trav'ller on his way 
 tree , bush , and rugged rock , and hollow dell 
 in deeper shades their forms confus'dly tell 
 to cheat the weary wand'rer ' s doubtful eye 
 whilst chilly passing winds come ruffling by 
 and tangled briars perplex the darken 'd pass 
 and slimy reptiles glimmer on the grass 
 and stinging night flies spend their cursed spite 
 unhospitable are thy shades , o night 

when all my trivial rhymes are blotted out 
 vanished our days , so precious and so few 
 if some should wonder what we were about 
 and what the little happenings we knew 
 i wish that they might know how , night by night 
 my pencil , heavy in the sleepy hours 
 sought vainly for some gracious way to write 
 how much this love is ours , and only ours 
 how many evenings , as you drowsed to sleep 
 i read to you by tawny candle glow 
 and watched you down the valley dim and deep 
 where poppies and the april flowers grow 
 then knelt beside your pillow with a prayer 
 and loved the breath of pansies in your hair 

the trembling queen ( the almighty order given 
 swift from the idaean summit shot to heaven 
 as some wayfaring man , who wanders o ’ er 
 in thought a length of lands he trod before 
 sends forth his active mind from place to place 
 joins hill to dale , and measures space with space 
 so swift flew juno to the bless ’ d abodes 
 if thought of man can match the speed of gods 
 there sat the powers in awful synod placed 
 they bow ’ d , and made obeisance as she pass ’ d 
 through all the brazen dome : with goblets crown ’ d 
 they hail her queen ; the nectar streams around 
 fair themis first presents the golden bowl 
 and anxious asks what cares disturb her soul 

one place there is — beneath the burial sod 
 where all mankind are equalized by death 
 another place there is — the fane of god 
 where all are equal , who draw living breath 
 juggle who will elsewhere with his own soul 
 playing the judas with a temporal dole 
 he who can come beneath that awful cope 
 in the dread presence of a maker just 
 who metes to ev'ry pinch of human dust 
 one even measure of immortal hope 
 he who can stand within that holy door 
 with soul unbow 'd by that pure spirit level 
 and frame unequal laws for rich and poor 
 might sit for hell and represent the devil 

a rose , as fair as ever saw the north 
 grew in a little garden all alone 
 a sweeter flower did nature ne'er put forth 
 nor fairer garden yet was never known 
 the maidens danced about it morn and noon 
 and learned bards of it their ditties made 
 the nimble fairies by the pale faced moon 
 watered the root and kissed her pretty shade 
 but well a day !— the gardener careless grew 
 the maids and fairies both were kept away 
 and in a drought the caterpillars threw 
 themselves upon the bud and every spray 
 god shield the stock ! if heaven send no supplies 
 the fairest blossom of the garden dies 

the curtains were half drawn , the floor was swept 
 and strewn with rushes , rosemary and may 
 lay thick upon the bed on which i lay 
 where through the lattice ivy shadows crept 
 he leaned above me , thinking that i slept 
 and could not hear him ; but i heard him say 
 ‘ poor child , poor child : ’ and as he turned away 
 came a deep silence , and i knew he wept 
 he did not touch the shroud , or raise the fold 
 that hid my face , or take my hand in his 
 or ruffle the smooth pillows for my head 
 he did not love me living ; but once dead 
 he pitied me ; and very sweet it is 
 to know he still is warm though i am cold 

i never saw that you did painting need 
 and therefore to your fair no painting set 
 i found ( or thought i found ) you did exceed 
 that barren tender of a poet 's debt 
 and therefore have i slept in your report 
 that you your self being extant well might show 
 how far a modern quill doth come too short 
 speaking of worth , what worth in you doth grow 
 this silence for my sin you did impute 
 which shall be most my glory being dumb 
 for i impair not beauty being mute 
 when others would give life , and bring a tomb 
 there lives more life in one of your fair eyes 
 than both your poets can in praise devise 

“ ’ tis true ( the cloud compelling power replies 
 this day we call the council of the skies 
 in care of human race ; even jove ’ s own eye 
 sees with regret unhappy mortals die 
 far on olympus ’ top in secret state 
 ourself will sit , and see the hand of fate 
 work out our will . celestial powers ! descend 
 and as your minds direct , your succour lend 
 to either host . troy soon must lie o ’ erthrown 
 if uncontroll ’ d achilles fights alone 
 their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes

thus far the crowd ;— and then lamenting turn 
 to present griefs :— amphion 's race extinct 
 unanimous they wail ; but hated still

 disjointed lay , the gods , ‘ tis said , quick join 'd

 and pelops perfect from the gift became 

then spake king arthur to sir bedivere 
 “ the sequel of to day unsolders all 
 the goodliest fellowship of famous knights 
 whereof this world holds record . such a sleep 
 they sleep — the men i loved . i think that we 
 shall never more , at any future time 
 delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds 
 walking about the gardens and the halls 
 of camelot , as in the days that were 
 i perish by this people which i made 
 tho ’ merlin sware that i should come again 
 to rule once more ; but , let what will be , be 
 i am so deeply smitten thro ’ the helm 
 that without help i cannot last till morn 

hail ! gifted youth , whose passion breathing lay 
 portrays a mind attuned to noblest themes 
 a mind , which , wrapt in fancy 's high wrought dreams 
 to nature 's veriest bounds its daring way 
 can wing : what charms throughout thy pages shine 
 to win with fairy thrill the melting soul 
 for though along impassion 'd grandeur roll 
 yet in full power simplicity is thine 
 proceed , sweet bard ! and the heaven granted fire 
 of pity , glowing in thy feeling breast 
 may nought destroy , may nought thy soul divest 
 of joy — of rapture in the living lyre 
 thou tunest so magically : but may fame 
 each passing year add honours to thy name 

outbound , your bark awaits you . were i one 
 whose prayer availeth much , my wish should be 
 your favoring trade wind and consenting sea 
 by sail or steed was never love outrun 
 and , here or there , love follows her in whom 
 all graces and sweet charities unite 
 the old greek beauty set in holier light 
 and her for whom new england 's byways bloom 
 who walks among us welcome as the spring 
 calling up blossoms where her light feet stray 
 god keep you both , make beautiful your way 
 comfort , console , and bless ; and safely bring 
 ere yet i make upon a vaster sea 
 the unreturning voyage , my friends to me 

be my companion under cool arcades 
 that frame some drowsy street and dazzling square 
 beyond whose flowers and palm tree promenades 
 white belfries burn in the blue tropic air 
 lie near me in dim forests where the croon 
 of wood doves sounds and moss banked water flows 
 or musing late till the midsummer moon 
 breaks through some ruined abbey 's empty rose 
 sweetest of those to day whose pious hands 
 tend the sequestered altar of romance 
 where fewer offerings burn , and fewer kneel 
 pour there your passionate beauty on my heart 
 and , gladdening such solitudes , impart 
 how sweet the fellowship of those who feel 

so saying , from the carven flower above 
 to which it made a restless heart , he took 
 and gave , the diamond : then from where he sat 
 at arthur 's right , with smiling face arose 
 with smiling face and frowning heart , a prince 
 in the mid might and flourish of his may 
 gawain , surnamed the courteous , fair and strong 
 and after lancelot , tristram , and geraint 
 and gareth , a good knight , but therewithal 
 sir modred 's brother , and the child of lot 
 nor often loyal to his word , and now 
 wroth that the king 's command to sally forth 
 in quest of whom he knew not , made him leave 
 the banquet , and concourse of knights and kings 

i would have fled , i would have followed back 
 that pleasant path we came , but all was changed 
 rocky the way , abrupt , and hard to find 
 yet i toiled on , and , toiling on , i thought 
 ‘ that way lies youth , and wisdom , and all good 
 for only by unlearning wisdom comes 
 and climbing backward to diviner youth 
 what the world teaches profits to the world 
 what the soul teaches profits to the soul 
 which then first stands erect with godward face 
 when she lets fall her pack of withered facts 
 the gleanings of the outward eye and ear 
 and looks and listens with her finer sense 
 nor truth nor knowledge cometh from without 

if e'er the sacred poem that hath made 
 both heav'n and earth copartners in its toil 
 and with lean abstinence , through many a year 
 faded my brow , be destin 'd to prevail 
 over the cruelty , which bars me forth 
 of the fair sheep fold , where a sleeping lamb 
 the wolves set on and fain had worried me 
 with other voice and fleece of other grain 
 i shall forthwith return , and , standing up 
 at my baptismal font , shall claim the wreath 
 due to the poet 's temples : for i there 
 first enter 'd on the faith which maketh souls 
 acceptable to god : and , for its sake 
 peter had then circled my forehead thus 

alone , beneath the tower whence thunder forth 
 the mandates of the tyrant of the north 
 poland 's sad genius kneels , absorbed in tears 
 bound , vanquished , pallid with her fears 
 alas ! the crucifix is all that 's left 
 to her , of freedom and her sons bereft 
 and on her royal robe foul marks are seen 
 where russian hectors ’ scornful feet have been 
 anon she hears the clank of murd'rous arms 
 the swordsmen come once more to spread alarms 
 and while she weeps against the prison walls 
 and waves her bleeding arm until it falls 
 to france she hopeless turns her glazing eyes 
 and sues her sister 's succor ere she dies 

therefore myself is that one only thing 
 i hold to use or waste , to keep or give 
 my sole possession every day i live 
 and still mine own despite time 's winnowing 
 ever mine own , while moons and seasons bring 
 from crudeness ripeness mellow and sanative 
 ever mine own , till death shall ply his sieve 
 and still mine own , when saints break grave and sing 
 and this myself as king unto my king 
 i give , to him who gave himself for me 
 who gives himself to me , and bids me sing 
 a sweet new song of his redeemed set free 
 he bids me sing : o death , where is thy sting 
 and sing : o grave , where is thy victory 

that , that was not apollo , not the god 
 this was not venus , though she venus seemed 
 a moment . and though fair yon river move 
 she , all the way , from disenchanted fount 
 to seas unhallowed runs ; the gods forsook 
 long since her trembling rushes ; from her plains 
 disconsolate , long since adventure fled 
 and now although the inviting river flows 
 and every poplared cape , and every bend 
 or willowy islet , win upon thy soul 
 and to thy hopeful shallop whisper speed 
 yet hope not thou at all ; hope is no more 
 and o , long since the golden groves are dead 
 the fa ë ry cities vanished from the land 

the tree of faith its bare , dry boughs must shed 
 that nearer heaven the living ones may climb 
 the false must fail , though from our shores of time 
 the old lament be heard , “ great pan is dead 
 that wail is error 's , from his high place hurled 
 this sharp recoil is evil undertrod 
 our time 's unrest , an angel sent of god 
 troubling with life the waters of the world 
 even as they list the winds of the spirit blow 
 to turn or break our century rusted vanes 
 sands shift and waste ; the rock alone remains 
 where , led of heaven , the strong tides come and go 
 and storm clouds , rent by thunderbolt and wind 
 leave , free of mist , the permanent stars behind 

there had been phantoms , pale remembered shapes 
 of this and this occasion , sisterly 
 in their resemblances , each effigy 
 crowned with the same bright hair above the nape 's 
 white rounded firmness , and each body alert 
 with such swift loveliness , that very rest 
 seemed a poised movement : ... phantoms that impressed 
 but a faint influence and could bless or hurt 
 no more than dreams . and these ghost things were she 
 for formless still , without identity 
 not one she seemed , not clear , but many and dim 
 one face among the legions of the street 
 indifferent mystery , she was for him 
 something still uncreated , incomplete 

six thousand veterans practis 'd in war 's game 
 tried men , at killicranky were array 'd 
 against an equal host that wore the plaid 
 shepherds and herdsmen .— like a whirlwind came 
 the highlanders , the slaughter spread like flame 
 and garry thundering down his mountain road 
 was stopp 'd , and could not breathe beneath the load 
 of the dead bodies . ‘ twas a day of shame 
 for them whom precept and the pedantry 
 of cold mechanic battle do enslave 
 oh ! for a single hour of that dundee 
 who on that day the word of onset gave 
 like conquest would the men of england see 
 and her foes find a like inglorious grave 

the dark day died , and when the moon arose 
 the foremost torch in day 's long funeral train 
 karagwe went down toward the river 's brink 
 thinking of what had been . he turned and saw 
 his enemy walk calmly up the road 
 quickly behind him came another form 
 and in a jeweled hand , half raised to strike 
 a poniard glistened . then the negro rose 
 and caught the weapon from the assassin 's grasp 
 and stood before the planter , dalton earl 
 “ forgive , ” he said , “ forgiveness is a slave 
 she has no pride , she never does an ill 
 for she is meekly great , and nobly good 
 and patient , though the lash of anger smites 

tonight a shimmer of gold lies mantled o'er 
 smooth lovely ocean . through the lustrous gloom 
 a savor steals from linden trees in bloom 
 and gardens ranged at many a palace door 
 proud walls rise here , and , where the moonbeams pour 
 their pale enchantment down the dim coast line 
 terrace and lawn , trim hedge and flowering vine 
 crown with fair culture all the sounding shore 
 how sweet , to such a place , on such a night 
 from halls with beauty and festival a glare 
 to come distract and , stretched on the cool turf 
 yield to some fond , improbable delight 
 while the moon , reddening , sinks , and all the air 
 sighs with the muffled tumult of the surf 

wonder it is and pity is't that she 
 in whom all beauty 's treasure we may find 
 that may unrich the body and the mind 
 towards the poor should use no charity 
 my love has gone a begging unto thee 
 and if that beauty had not been more kind 
 that pity , long ere this he had been pined 
 but beauty is content his food to be 
 o pity have when such poor orphans beg 
 love , naked boy , hath nothing on his back 
 and though he wanteth neither arm nor leg 
 yet maimed he is sith he his sight doth lack 
 and yet though blind he beauty can behold 
 and yet though naked he feels more heat than cold 

then blue smoke haze of the cooking rose 
 and tent peg answered to hammer nose 
 and the picketed ponies , shag and wild 
 strained at their ropes as the feed was piled 
 and the bubbling camels beside the load 
 sprawled for a furlong adown the road 
 and the persian pussy cats , brought for sale 
 spat at the dogs from the camel bale 
 and the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food 
 and the camp fires twinkled by fort jumrood 
 and there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk 
 a savour of camels and carpets and musk 
 a murmur of voices , a reek of smoke 
 to tell us the trade of the khyber woke 

did i not know a great man 's power and might 
 in spite of innocence can smother right 
 colour his villainies to get esteem 
 and make the honest man the villain seem 
 i know it , and the world doth know ‘ tis true 
 yet i protest if such a man i knew 
 that might my country prejudice or thee 
 were he the greatest or the proudest he 
 that breathes this day ; if so it might be found 
 that any good to either might redound 
 i unappalled , dare in such a case 
 rip up his foulest crimes before his face 
 though for my labour i were sure to drop 
 into the mouth of ruin without hope 

here now is winter . winter , after all 
 is not so drear as was my boding dream 
 while autumn gleamed its latest watery gleam 
 on sapless leafage too inert to fall 
 still leaves and berries clothe my garden wall 
 where ivy thrives on scantiest sunny beam 
 still here a bud and there a blossom seem 
 hopeful , and robin still is musical 
 leaves , flowers and fruit and one delightful song 
 remain ; these days are short , but now the nights 
 intense and long , hang out their utmost lights 
 such starry nights are long , yet not too long 
 frost nips the weak , while strengthening still the strong 
 against that day when spring sets all to rights 

eudorus next ; whom polymele the gay 
 famed in the graceful dance , produced to day 
 her , sly cellenius loved : on her would gaze 
 as with swift step she form ’ d the running maze 
 to her high chamber from diana ’ s quire 
 the god pursued her , urged , and crown ’ d his fire 
 the son confess ’ d his father ’ s heavenly race 
 and heir ’ d his mother ’ s swiftness in the chase 
 strong echecleus , bless ’ d in all those charms 
 that pleased a god , succeeded to her arms 
 not conscious of those loves , long hid from fame 
 with gifts of price he sought and won the dame 
 her secret offspring to her sire she bare 
 her sire caress ’ d him with a parent ’ s care 

when i consider life and its few years 
 a wisp of fog betwixt us and the sun 
 a call to battle , and the battle done 
 ere the last echo dies within our ears 
 a rose choked in the grass ; an hour of fears 
 the gusts that past a darkening shore do beat 
 the burst of music down an unlistening street 
 i wonder at the idleness of tears 
 ye old , old dead , and ye of yesternight 
 chieftains , and bards , and keepers of the sheep 
 by every cup of sorrow that you had 
 loose me from tears , and make me see aright 
 how each hath back what once he stayed to weep 
 homer his sight , david his little lad 

now sank the sun to ocean 's fathomless flood 
 o'er the dim land the infinite darkness stole 
 wherein men gain a little rest from toil 
 then by the ships , despite their sorrow , supped 
 the argives , for ye cannot thrust aside 
 hunger 's importunate craving , when it comes 
 upon the breast , but straightway heavy and faint 
 lithe limbs become ; nor is there remedy 
 until one satisfy this clamorous guest 
 therefore these ate the meat of eventide 
 in grief for achilles ’ hard necessity 
 constrained them all . and , when they had broken bread 
 sweet sleep came on them , loosening from their frames 
 care 's heavy chain , and quickening strength anew 

then arthur rose and lancelot follow 'd him 
 and while they stood without the doors , the king 
 turn 'd to him saying , “ is it then so well 
 or mine the blame that oft i seem as he 
 of whom was written , ‘ a sound is in his ears 
 the foot that loiters , bidden go ,— the glance 
 that only seems half loyal to command 
 a manner somewhat fall'n from reverence 
 or have i dream 'd the bearing of our knights 
 tells of a manhood ever less and lower 
 or whence the fear lest this my realm , uprear 'd 
 by noble deeds at one with noble vows 
 from flat confusion and brute violences 
 reel back into the beast , and be no more 

keep love for youth , and violets for the spring 
 of if these bloom when worn out autumn grieves 
 let them lie hid in double shade of leaves 
 their own , and others dropped down withering 
 for violets suit when home birds build and sing 
 not when the outbound bird a passage cleaves 
 not with dry stubble of mown harvest sheaves 
 but when the green world buds to blossoming 
 keep violets for the spring , and love for youth 
 love that should dwell with beauty , mirth , and hope 
 or if a later sadder love be born 
 let this not look for grace beyond its scope 
 but give itself , nor plead for answering truth 
 a grateful ruth tho ’ gleaning scanty corn 

run , shepherds , run where bethlehem blest appears 
 we bring the best of news ; be not dismayed 
 a saviour there is born more old than years 
 amidst heaven 's rolling heights this earth who stayed 
 in a poor cottage inned , a virgin maid 
 a weakling did him bear , who all upbears 
 there is he poorly swaddled , in manger laid 
 to whom too narrow swaddlings are our spheres 
 run , shepherds , run , and solemnize his birth 
 this is that night — no , day , grown great with bliss 
 in which the power of satan broken is 
 in heaven be glory , peace unto the earth 
 thus singing , through the air the angels swarm 
 and cope of stars re echoed the same 

a poor companion whom his friend takes down 
 to fair surrentum or brundisium 's town 
 if he makes much of cold , bad roads , and rain 
 or moans o'er cashhyppphenbox forced and money ta'en 
 reminds us of a girl , some artful thing 
 who cries for a lost bracelet or a ring 
 with this result , that when she comes to grieve 
 for real misfortunes , no one will believe 
 so , hoaxed by one impostor , in the street 
 a man wo n't set a cripple on his feet 
 though he invoke osiris , and appeal 
 with streaming tears to hearts that will not feel 
 “ lift up a poor lame man ! i tell no lie 
 “ treat foreigners to that , ” the neighbours cry 

among the folks , to whom he visits paid 
 was neighbour peter , one who used the spade 
 a villager that god , in lieu of lands 
 had furnished only with a pair of hands 
 to dig and delve , and by the mattock gain 
 enough his wife and children to maintain 
 still youthful charms you in his spouse might trace 
 the weather injured solely had her face 
 but not the features which were perfect yet 
 some wish perhaps more blooming belles to get 
 the rustick truly me would ne'er have pleased 
 but such are oft by country parsons seized 
 who low amours and dishes coarse admire 
 that palates more refined would not desire 

beyond the north wind lay the land of old 
 where men dwelt blithe and blameless , clothed and fed 
 with joy 's bright raiment and with love 's sweet bread 
 the whitest flock of earth 's maternal fold 
 none there might wear about his brows enrolled 
 a light of lovelier fame than rings your head 
 whose lovesome love of children and the dead 
 all men give thanks for : i far off behold 
 a dear dead hand that links us , and a light 
 the blithest and benignest of the night 
 the night of death 's sweet sleep , wherein may be 
 a star to show your spirit in present sight 
 some happier island in the elysian sea 
 where rab may lick the hand of marjorie 

life ! austere arbiter of each man 's fate 
 by whom he learns that nature 's steadfast laws 
 are as decrees immutable ; o pause 
 your even forward march ! not yet too late 
 teach me the needed lesson , when to wait 
 inactive as a ship when no wind draws 
 to stretch the loosened cordage . one implores 
 thy clemency , whose wilfulness innate 
 has gone uncurbed and roughshod while the years 
 have lengthened into decades ; now distressed 
 he knows no rule by which to move or stay 
 and teased with restlessness and desperate fears 
 he dares not watch in silence thy wise way 
 bringing about results none could have guessed 

strong son of fergus , with thy latest breath 
 thou hast lent a joy unto the funeral knell 
 welcoming with thy whispered “ all is well 
 the awful aspect of the angel death 
 as , strong in life , thou couldst not brook to shun 
 the heat and burthen of the fiery day 
 fronting defeat with stalwart undismay 
 and wearing meekly honours stoutly won 
 pure lips , pure hands , pure heart were thine , as aye 
 erin demanded from her bards of old 
 and , therefore , on thy harpstrings of pure gold 
 has waked once more her high heroic lay 
 what shoulders now shall match the mighty fold 
 of ossian 's mantle ? thou hast passed away 

misery , beyond all men 's most miserable 
 absolute , whole , defiant of defence 
 inevitable , inexplacable , intense 
 more vast than heaven is high , more deep than hell 
 past cure or charm of solace or of spell 
 possesses and pervades the spirit and sense 
 whereto the expanse of the earth pays tribute ; whence 
 breeds evil only , and broods on fumes that swell 
 rank from the blood of brother and mother and wife 
 ‘ misery of miseries , all is misery , ’ saith 
 the heavy fair faced hateful head , at strife 
 with its own lusts that burn with feverous breath 
 lips which the loathsome bitterness of life 
 leaves fearful of the bitterness of death 

“ only hope of our age , that virtues dead 
 by your sweet breath should be revived again 
 learning discouraged long by rude disdain 
 by your white hands is only cherish è d 
 thus others ’ worth by you is honour è d 
 but who shall honour yours ? poor wits , in vain 
 we seek to pay the debts which you pertain 
 till from yourself some wealth be borrow è d 
 lend some your tongues , that every nation may 
 in his own hear your virtuous praises blaze 
 lend them your wit , your judgment , memory 
 lest they themselves should not know what to say 
 and that thou mayst be loved as much as praised 
 my heart thou mayst lend them which i gave thee 

i would not if i could undo my past 
 tho ’ for its sake my future is a blank 
 my past for which i have myself to thank 
 for all its faults and follies first and last 
 i would not cast anew the lot once cast 
 or launch a second ship for one that sank 
 or drug with sweets the bitterness i drank 
 or break by feasting my perpetual fast 
 i would not if i could : for much more dear 
 is one remembrance than a hundred joys 
 more than a thousand hopes in jubilee 
 dearer the music of one tearful voice 
 that unforgotten calls and calls to me 
 “ follow me here , rise up , and follow here 

above the spring tide sundawn of the year 
 a sunlike star , not born of day or night 
 filled the fair heaven of spring with heavenlier light 
 made of all ages orbed in one sole sphere 
 whose light was as a titan 's smile or tear 
 then rose a ray more flowerlike , starry white 
 like a child 's eye grown lovelier with delight 
 sweet as a child 's heart lightening laugh to hear 
 and last a fire from heaven , a fiery rain 
 as of god 's wrath on the unclean cities , fell 
 and lit the shuddering shades of half seen hell 
 that shrank before it and were cloven in twain 
 a beacon fired by lightning , whence all time 
 sees red the bare black ruins of a crime 

sweet , i protest , and seal it with an oath 
 i never saw that so my thoughts did please 
 and yet content displeased i see them wroth 
 to love so much and cannot have their ease 
 i told my thoughts , my sovereign made a pause 
 disposed to grant , but willing to delay 
 they then repined , for that they knew no cause 
 and swore they wished she flatly would say nay 
 thus hath my love , my thoughts with treason filled 
 and ‘ gainst my sovereign taught them to repine 
 so thus my treason all my thoughts hath killed 
 and made fair licia say she is not mine 
 but thoughts too rash my heart doth now repent 
 and as you please , they swear , they are content 

‘ one caution yet is needful to be told 
 to guide your choice : this wife must not be old 
 there goes a saying , and ‘ twas shrewdly said 
 old fish at table , but young flesh in bed 
 my soul abhors the tasteless dry embrace 
 of a stale virgin with a winter face 
 in that cold season love but treats his guest 
 with beanstraw , and tough forage at the best 
 no crafty widows shall approach my bed 
 those are too wise for bachelors to wed 
 as subtle clerks by many schools are made 
 twice married dames are mistresses o ’ th ’ trade 
 but young and tender virgins , ruled with ease 
 we form like wax , and mould them as we please 

from all the mischiefs that i mention here 
 preserve us , heaven , in this approaching year 
 from civil wars and those uncivil things 
 that hate the race of all our queens and kings 
 from those who for self ends would all betray 
 from saints that curse and flatter when they pray 
 from those that hold it merit to rebel 
 in treason , murthers , and in theft excel 
 from those new teachers have destroy 'd the old 
 and those that turn the gospel into gold 
 from a high court , and that rebellious crew 
 that did their hands in royal blood imbrue 
 defend us , heaven , and to the throne restore 
 the rightful heir , and we will ask no more 

uncivil sickness , hast thou no regard 
 but dost presume my dearest to molest 
 and without leave dar'st enter in that breast 
 whereto sweet love approach yet never dared 
 spare thou her health , which my life hath not spared 
 too bitter such revenge of my unrest 
 although with wrongs my thought she hath opprest 
 my wrongs seek not revenge , they crave reward 
 cease , sickness , cease in her then to remain 
 and come and welcome , harbour thou in me 
 whom love long since hath taught to suffer in 
 so she which hath so oft my pain increased 
 o god , that i might so reveng è d be 
 by my poor pain might have her pain released 

when thou shalt search thy glass nor find the flower 
 that there so long smiled gay , unwithering 
 and from sad vantage of a forlorn hour 
 that fore nor aft unmasks one hint of spring 
 thou mourn'st the barrenness of beauty spent 
 with no reserv è d treasure for the day 
 when all that youth and sunny fortune lent 
 no more should light adoring eyes to thee 
 and fear'st thyself a cold , by the last storm 
 beat to thine inn , a still , uncarping guest 
 thy once bright eye a pilot to the worm 
 making his dungeon way to his new feast 
 drop not a tear then for thy beauty fled 
 but for the wounds it healed not bow thy head 

thou mighty mars , the lord of soldiers brave 
 and thou mirnerve , that dost in wit excel 
 and thou apollo , who dost knowledge have 
 of every art that from parnassus fell 
 with all your sisters that thereon do dwell 
 lament for him who duly serv 'd you all 
 whom in you wisely all your arts did mell 
 bewail ( i say ) his unexpected fall 
 i need not in remembrance for to call 
 his race , his youth , the hope had of him ay 
 since that in him doth cruel death appall 
 both manhood , wit and learning every way 
 but yet he doth in bed of honour rest 
 and evermore of him shall live the best 

not from without us , only from within 
 comes or can ever come upon us light 
 whereby the soul keeps ever truth in sight 
 no truth , no strength , no comfort man may win 
 no grace for guidance , no release from sin 
 save of his own soul 's giving . deep and bright 
 as fire enkindled in the core of night 
 burns in the soul where once its fire has been 
 the light that leads and quickens thought , inspired 
 to doubt and trust and conquer . so he said 
 whom sidney , flower of england , lordliest head 
 of all we love , loved : but the fates required 
 a sacrifice to hate and hell , ere fame 
 should set with his in heaven giordano 's name 

are those two stars , her eyes , my life 's light gone 
 by which my soul was fre è d from all dark 
 and am i left distressed to live alone 
 where none my tears and mournful tale shall mark 
 ah sun , why shine thy looks , thy looks like gold 
 when horsemen brave thou risest in the east 
 ah cynthia pale , to whom my griefs i told 
 why do you both rejoice both man and beast 
 and i alone , alone that dark possess 
 by licia 's absence brighter than the sun 
 whose smiling light did ease my sad distress 
 and broke the clouds , when tears like rain begun 
 heavens , grant that light and so me waking keep 
 or shut my eyes and rock me fast asleep 

forth from his barren cell came kathanal 
 strong and inspired , born anew for deeds 
 straightway he grew to be the bravest knight 
 under king constantine , since sir sanpeur 
 the boldest in the battles for the right 
 the kindest in his judgment of the wrong 
 his eyes that held the vision of the grail 
 were ever clear to see and know the truth 
 his lips that had been touched by holy chrism 
 were strong to utter holy living words 
 he sang of life in life , and life in death 
 and taught the lesson that his heart had learned 
 all love should be a glory , not a doom 
 love for love 's sake , albeit bliss denied 

in heaven was dole among the immortal ones 
 even all that helped the stalwart danaans ’ cause 
 in clouds like mountains piled they veiled their heads 
 for grief of soul . but glad those others were 
 who fain would speed troy to a happy goal 
 then unto cronos ’ son great hera spake 
 “ zeus , lightning father , wherefore helpest thou 
 troy , all forgetful of the fair haired bride 
 whom once to peleus thou didst give to wife 
 midst pelion 's glens ? thyself didst bring to pass 
 those spousals of a goddess : on that day 
 all we immortals feasted there , and gave 
 gifts passing fair . all this dost thou forget 
 and hast devised for hellas heaviest woe 

shout , for a mighty victory is won 
 on british ground the invaders are laid low 
 the breath of heaven has drifted them like snow 
 and left them lying in the silent sun 
 never to rise again !— the work is done 
 come forth , ye old men , now in peaceful show 
 and greet your sons ! drums beat , and trumpets blow 
 make merry , wives ! ye little children stun 
 your grandame 's ears with pleasure of your noise 
 clap , infants , clap your hands ! divine must be 
 that triumph , when the very worst , the pain 
 and even the prospect of our brethren slain 
 hath something in it which the heart enjoys 
 in glory will they sleep and endless sanctity 

has she forgotten ? on this very may 
 we were to meet here , with the birds and bees 
 as on that sabbath , underneath the trees 
 we strayed among the tombs , and stripped away 
 the vines from these old granites , cold and gray 
 and yet indeed not grim enough were they 
 to stay our kisses , smiles and ecstasies 
 or closer voice lost vows and rhapsodies 
 has she forgotten — that the may has won 
 its promise ?— that the bird songs from the tree 
 are sprayed above the grasses as the sun 
 might jar the dazzling dew down showeringly 
 has she forgotten life — love — everyone 
 has she forgotten me — forgotten me 

“ great perils , father ! wait the unequal fight 
 these younger champions will oppress thy might 
 thy veins no more with ancient vigour glow 
 weak is thy servant , and thy coursers slow 
 then haste , ascend my seat , and from the car 
 observe the steeds of tros , renown ’ d in war 
 practised alike to turn , to stop , to chase 
 to dare the fight , or urge the rapid race 
 these late obey ’ d æ neas ’ guiding rein 
 leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train 
 with these against yon trojans will we go 
 nor shall great hector want an equal foe 
 fierce as he is , even he may learn to fear 
 the thirsty fury of my flying spear 

‘ twas the night after christmas , and all through the house 
 not a creature was stirring — excepting a mouse 
 the stockings were flung in haste over the chair 
 for hopes of st. nicholas were no longer there 
 the children were restlessly tossing in bed 
 for the pie and the candy were heavy as lead 
 while mamma in her kerchief , and i in my gown 
 had just made up our minds that we would not lie down 
 when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter 
 i sprang from my chair to see what was the matter 
 away to the window i went with a dash 
 flung open the shutter , and threw up the sash 
 the moon on the breast of the new fallen snow 
 gave the lustre of noon day to objects below 

a satyr spied a goddess in her bath 
 unseen of her attendant nymphs ; none knew 
 forthwith the creature to his fellows drew 
 and looking backward on the curtained path 
 he strove to tell ; he could but heave a breast 
 too full , and point to mouth , with failing leers 
 vainly he danced for speech , he giggled tears 
 made as if torn in two , as if tight pressed 
 as if cast prone ; then fetching whimpered tunes 
 for words , flung heel and set his hairy flight 
 through forest hollows , over rocky height 
 the green leaves buried him three rounds of moons 
 a senatorial satyr named what herb 
 had hurried him outrunning reason 's curb 

his lance bold thoas at the conqueror sent 
 deep in his breast above the pap it went 
 amid the lungs was fix ’ d the winged wood 
 and quivering in his heaving bosom stood 
 till from the dying chief , approaching near 
 the æ tolian warrior tugg ’ d his weighty spear 
 then sudden waved his flaming falchion round 
 and gash ’ d his belly with a ghastly wound 
 the corpse now breathless on the bloody plain 
 to spoil his arms the victor strove in vain 
 the thracian bands against the victor press ’ d 
 a grove of lances glitter ’ d at his breast 
 stern thoas , glaring with revengeful eyes 
 in sullen fury slowly quits the prize 

degenerate douglas ! oh , the unworthy lord 
 whom mere despite of heart could so far please 
 and love of havoc ( for with such disease 
 fame taxes him ) that he could send forth word 
 to level with the dust a noble horde 
 a brotherhood of venerable trees 
 leaving an ancient dome , and towers like these 
 beggared and outraged !— many hearts deplor 'd 
 the fate of those old trees ; and oft with pain 
 the traveller , at this day , will stop and gaze 
 on wrongs , which nature scarcely seems to heed 
 for shelter 'd places , bosoms , nooks and bays 
 and the pure mountains , and the gentle tweed 
 and the green silent pastures , yet remain 

“ curse thee , life , i will live with thee no more 
 thou hast mocked me , starved me , beat my body sore 
 and all for a pledge that was not pledged by me 
 i have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly 
 that i might eat again , and met thy sneers 
 with deprecations , and thy blows with tears 
 aye , from thy glutted lash , glad , crawled away 
 as if spent passion were a holiday 
 and now i go . nor threat , nor easy vow 
 of tardy kindness can avail thee now 
 with me , whence fear and faith alike are flown 
 lonely i came , and i depart alone 
 and know not where nor unto whom i go 
 but that thou canst not follow me i know 

i sing the pilgrim of a softer clime 
 and milder speech than those brave men 's who brought 
 to the ice and iron of our winter time 
 a will as firm , a creed as stern , and wrought 
 with one mailed hand , and with the other fought 
 simply , as fits my theme , in homely rhyme 
 i sing the blue eyed german spener taught 
 through whose veiled , mystic faith the inward light 
 steady and still , an easy brightness , shone 
 transfiguring all things in its radiance white 
 the garland which his meekness never sought 
 i bring him ; over fields of harvest sown 
 with seeds of blessing , now to ripeness grown 
 i bid the sower pass before the reapers ’ sight 

dear chorister , who from those shadows sends 
 ere that the blushing morn dare show her light 
 such sad lamenting strains , that night attends 
 become all ear , stars stay to hear thy plight 
 if one whose grief even reach of thought transcends 
 who ne'er , not in a dream , did taste delight 
 may thee importune who like care pretends 
 and seems to joy in woe , in woe 's despite 
 tell me ( so may thou fortune milder try 
 and long , long sing ) for what thou thus complains 
 since , winter gone , the sun in dappled sky 
 now smiles on meadows , mountains , woods , and plains 
 the bird , as if my questions did her move 
 with trembling wings sobbed forth , i love ! i love 

“ so speaking , from the ruddy orient shone 
 the morn , conspicuous on her golden throne 
 the goddess with a radiant tunic dress 'd 
 my limbs , and o'er me cast a silken vest 
 long flowing robes , of purest white , array 
 the nymph , that added lustre to the day 
 a tiar wreath 'd her head with many a fold 
 her waist was circled with a zone of gold 
 forth issuing then , from place to place i flew 
 rouse man by man , and animate my crew 
 ‘ rise , rise , my mates ! ‘ tis circe gives command 
 our journey calls us ; haste , and quit the land 
 all rise and follow , yet depart not all 
 for fate decreed one wretched man to fall 

as sheep , that step from forth their fold , by one 
 or pairs , or three at once ; meanwhile the rest 
 stand fearfully , bending the eye and nose 
 to ground , and what the foremost does , that do 
 the others , gath'ring round her , if she stops 
 simple and quiet , nor the cause discern 
 so saw i moving to advance the first 
 who of that fortunate crew were at the head 
 of modest mien and graceful in their gait 
 when they before me had beheld the light 
 from my right side fall broken on the ground 
 so that the shadow reach 'd the cave , they stopp 'd 
 and somewhat back retir 'd : the same did all 
 who follow 'd , though unweeting of the cause 

this binds thee , then , to farther my design 
 as i am bound by vow to farther thine 
 nor canst , nor darest thou , traitor , on the plain 
 appeach my honour , or thy own maintain 
 since thou art of my council , and the friend 
 whose faith i trust , and on whose care depend 
 and wouldst thou court my lady 's love , which i 
 much rather than release , would choose to die 
 but thou , false arcite , never shalt obtain 
 thy bad pretence ; i told thee first my pain 
 for first my love began ere thine was born 
 thou as my council , and my brother sworn 
 art bound to assist my eldership of right 
 or justly to be deemed a perjured knight 

the world is too much with us ; late and soon 
 getting and spending , we lay waste our powers 
 little we see in nature that is ours 
 we have given our hearts away , a sordid boon 
 this sea that bares her bosom to the moon 
 the winds that will be howling at all hours 
 and are up gathered now like sleeping flowers 
 for this , for everything , we are out of tune 
 it moves us not .— great god ! i 'd rather be 
 a pagan suckled in a creed outworn 
 so might i , standing on this pleasant lea 
 have glimpses that would make me less forlorn 
 have sight of proteus rising from the sea 
 or hear old triton blow his wreath è d horn 

immense , august , like some titanic bloom 
 the mighty choir unfolds its lithic core 
 petalled with panes of azure , gules and or 
 splendidly lambent in the gothic gloom 
 and stamened with keen flamelets that illume 
 the pale high altar . on the prayer worn floor 
 by worshippers innumerous thronged of yore 
 a few brown crones , familiars of the tomb 
 the stranded driftwood of faith 's ebbing sea 
 for these alone the finials fret the skies 
 the topmost bosses shake their blossoms free 
 while from the triple portals , with grave eyes 
 tranquil , and fixed upon eternity 
 the cloud of witnesses still testifies 

ever athwart life 's sunlit , upland ways 
 falleth the shadow of impending death 
 and still life 's flowers beneath his blighting breath 
 to ashes wither , and to dust , her bays 
 what were the worth of hard won power or praise 
 awaits us all the grave cell dark and deep 
 the greedy grave worm 's maw , the awful sleep 
 when death his cold hand on our pulses lays 
 what then the end of action or of strife 
 the sphinx è d riddle of the universe 
 nature 's unsolved enigma , who may prove 
 life 's passion play all blindly men rehearse 
 but yet our recompense for birth , for life 
 for death itself , meseems , is deathless love 

he turns about to face the loud uproar 
 and drives the rebels to their very door 
 the frequent stone is hurled where eer they go 
 when badgers fight , then every one 's a foe 
 the dogs are clapt and urged to join the fray 
 the badger turns and drives them all away 
 though scarcely half as big , demure and small 
 he fights with dogs for bones and beats them all 
 the heavy mastiff , savage in the fray 
 lies down and licks his feet and turns away 
 the bulldog knows his match and waxes cold 
 the badger grins and never leaves his hold 
 he drives the crowd and follows at their heels 
 and bites them through — the drunkard swears and reels 

lay me where soft cyrene rambles down 
 in grove and garden to the sapphire sea 
 twine yellow roses for the drinker 's crown 
 let music reach and fair heads circle me 
 watching blue ocean where the white sails steer 
 fruit laden forth or with the wares and news 
 of merchant cities seek our harbors here 
 careless how corinth fares , how syracuse 
 but here , with love and sleep in her caress 
 warm night shall sink and utterly persuade 
 the gentle doctrine aristippus bare 
 night winds , and one whose white youth 's loveliness 
 in a flowered balcony beside me laid 
 dreams , with the starlight on her fragrant hair 

the learned teacher satisfaction showed 
 that such success from his instructions flowed 
 laughed heartily at husbands , silly wights 
 who had not wit to guard connubial rights 
 and from their lamb the wily wolf to keep 
 a shepherd will o'erlook a hundred sheep 
 while foolish man 's unable to protect 
 e'en one where most he 'd wish to be correct 
 howe'er , this care he thought was somewhat hard 
 but not a thing impossible to guard 
 and if he had not got a hundred eyes 
 thank heav'n , his wife , though cunning to devise 
 he could defy :— her thoughts so well he knew 
 that these intrigues she never would pursue 

fair is my love , and cruel as she 's fair 
 her brow shades frown , although her eyes are sunny 
 her smiles are lightning , though her pride despair 
 and her disdains are gall , her favours honey 
 a modest maid , deck 'd with a blush of honour 
 whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love 
 the wonder of all eyes that look upon her 
 sacred on earth ; design 'd a saint above 
 chastity and beauty , which are deadly foes 
 live reconciled friends within her brow 
 and had she pity to conjoin with those 
 then who had heard the plaints i utter now 
 for had she not been fair , and thus unkind 
 my muse had slept , and none had known my mind 

a hundred instances the fact attest 
 but sage boccace has one , it is confessed 
 which seems to me , howe'er we search around 
 to be a sample , rarely to be found 
 ‘ tis chimon that i mean , a savage youth 
 well formed in person , but the rest uncouth 
 a bear in mind , but cupid much can do 
 love licked the cub , and decent soon he grew 
 a fine gallant at length the lad appeared 
 from whence the change ?— fine eyes his bosom cheered 
 the piercing rays no sooner reached his sight 
 but all the savage took at once to flight 
 he felt the tender flame ; polite became 
 you 'll find howe'er , our tale is not the same 

how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame 
 which like a canker in the fragrant rose 
 doth spot the beauty of thy budding name 
 o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose 
 that tongue that tells the story of thy days 
 ( making lascivious comments on thy sport 
 cannot dispraise , but in a kind of praise 
 naming thy name , blesses an ill report 
 o what a mansion have those vices got 
 which for their habitation chose out thee 
 where beauty 's veil doth cover every blot 
 and all things turns to fair , that eyes can see 
 take heed ( dear heart ) of this large privilege 
 the hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge 

bowed in the firelight 's softly climbing gleam 
 i sit a shadow , in a shadow 's place 
 while through the great , grey window vaguely stream 
 twilight caresses on each pictured face 
 that one hour gone was cold in art 's repose 
 now each still canvas answers tremblingly 
 till eyes unveil and living spirit glows 
 where no light was while the rude day went by 
 and rudest day , that passed so sternly bare 
 cold as the life that walks without desire 
 unbeauteous as duty or despair 
 plucked by a hope that will not set her free 
 turns back , while memory 's soft , informing fire 
 falls on her face , and beauty looks at me 

ere greece soared , showering sovranties of light 
 ere rome shook earth with her tremendous tread 
 ere yon blue feasting sun god burst blood red 
 beneath thee slept thy prodigy , o night 
 aeons have ta'en like dreams their strange , slow flight 
 and vastest , tiniest , creatures paved her bed 
 e'en cities sapped by the usurping spread 
 of her imperious waves have sunk from sight 
 since she first chanted her colossal psalms 
 that swell and sink beneath the listening stars 
 oft , as with myriad drums beating to arms 
 she thunders out the grandeur of her wars 
 then shifts through moaning moods her wizard charms 
 of slow flutes and caressing , gay guitars 

yet there is peace for man .— yea , there is peace 
 even in this noisy , this unsettled scene 
 when from the crowd , and from the city far 
 haply he may be set ( in his late walk 
 o'ertaken with deep thought ) beneath the boughs 
 of honeysuckle , when the sun is gone 
 and with fix 'd eye , and wistful , he surveys 
 the solemn shadows of the heavens sail 
 and thinks the season yet shall come , when time 
 will waft him to repose , to deep repose 
 far from the unquietness of life — from noise 
 and tumult far — beyond the flying clouds 
 beyond the stars , and all this passing scene 
 where change shall cease , and time shall be no more 

amazed at what the lordly devil said 
 the clod could naught reply , so great his dread 
 but at the gasconade perretta smiled 
 who kept his house and weary hours beguiled 
 a sprightly clever lass , with prying eye 
 who , when a shepherdess , could more descry 
 than sheep or lambs she watched upon the plain 
 if other views or points she sought to gain 
 said she , weep not , i 'll undertake at ease 
 to gull this novice devil as i please 
 he 's young and ignorant ; has nothing seen 
 thee ; from his rage , i thoroughly will skreen 
 my little finger , if i like can show 
 more malice than his head and body know 

what bashful wildness in those crystal eyes 
 fair zillia !— ah ! more dear to love the gaze 
 that dwells upon its object , than the rays 
 of that vague glance , quick , as in summer skies 
 the lightning 's lambent flash , when neither rise 
 thunder , nor storm .— i mark , while transport plays 
 warm in thy lover 's eye , what dread betrays 
 thy throbbing heart :— yet why from his soft sighs 
 fleet'st thou so swift away ?— like the young hind 
 that bending stands the fountain 's brim beside 
 when , with a sudden gust , the western wind 
 rustles among the boughs that shade the tide 
 see , from the stream , innoxious and benign 
 starting she bounds , with terror vain as thine 

so is it not with me as with that muse 
 stirred by a painted beauty to his verse 
 who heaven it self for ornament doth use 
 and every fair with his fair doth rehearse 
 making a couplement of proud compare 
 with sun and moon , with earth and sea 's rich gems 
 with april 's first born flowers and all things rare 
 that heaven 's air in this huge rondure hems 
 o let me true in love but truly write 
 and then believe me , my love is as fair 
 as any mother 's child , though not so bright 
 as those gold candles fixed in heaven 's air 
 let them say more that like of hearsay well 
 i will not praise that purpose not to sell 

iii . heav'n from all creatures hides the book of fate 
 all but the page prescrib 'd , their present state 
 from brutes what men , from men what spirits know 
 or who could suffer being here below 
 the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day 
 had he thy reason , would he skip and play 
 pleas 'd to the last , he crops the flow'ry food 
 and licks the hand just rais 'd to shed his blood 
 oh blindness to the future ! kindly giv'n 
 that each may fill the circle mark 'd by heav'n 
 who sees with equal eye , as god of all 
 a hero perish , or a sparrow fall 
 atoms or systems into ruin hurl 'd 
 and now a bubble burst , and now a world 

how like a winter hath my absence been 
 from thee , the pleasure of the fleeting year 
 what freezings have i felt , what dark days seen 
 what old december 's bareness everywhere 
 and yet this time removed was summer 's time 
 the teeming autumn big with rich increase 
 bearing the wanton burden of the prime 
 like widowed wombs after their lords ’ decease 
 yet this abundant issue seemed to me 
 but hope of orphans , and unfathered fruit 
 for summer and his pleasures wait on thee 
 and thou away , the very birds are mute 
 or if they sing , ‘ tis with so dull a cheer 
 that leaves look pale , dreading the winter 's near 

under that foggy sunset london glowed 
 like one huge cob webbed flagon of old wine 
 and , as i walked down fleet street , the soft sky 
 mowed thro ’ the roaring thoroughfares , transfused 
 their hard sharp outlines , blurred the throngs of black 
 on either pavement , blurred the rolling stream 
 of red and yellow busses , till the town 
 turned to a golden suburb of the clouds 
 and , round that mighty bubble of st. paul 's 
 over the up turned faces of the street 
 an air ship slowly sailed , with whirring fans 
 a voyager in the new found realms of gold 
 a shadowy silken chrysalis whence should break 
 what radiant wings in centuries to be 

viii . if thou didst pass by art , thou didst not scorn 
 the souls that by such symbol yearned in vain 
 from truth and love true nourishment to gain 
 on thy warm breast , so chilly and forlorn 
 fell these thy nurslings little more than born 
 that thou wast anguished , and there fell a rain 
 from thy blest eyelids , and in grief and pain 
 thou partedst from them yet one night and morn 
 to find them wholesome food and nourishment 
 instead of what their blindness took for such 
 laying thyself a seed in earthen rent 
 from which , outspringing to the willing touch 
 riseth for all thy children harvest great 
 for which they will all learn to bless thee yet 

‘ liza 's old man 's perhaps a little shady 
 ‘ liza 's old woman 's prone to booze and cringe 
 but ‘ liza deems herself a perfect lady 
 and proves it in her feathers and her fringe 
 for ‘ liza has a bloke her heart to cheer 
 with pearlies and a barrer and a jack 
 so all the vegetables of the year 
 are duly represented on her back 
 her boots are sacrifices to her hats 
 which knock you speechless — like a load of bricks 
 her summer velvets dazzle wanstead flats 
 and cost , at times , a good eighteen and six 
 withal , outside the gay and giddy whirl 
 ‘ liza 's a stupid , straight , hard working girl 

thou who hast made for such sure purposes 
 the mightiest and the meanest thing that is   
 planned out the lives of insects of the air 
 with fine precision and consummate care 
 thou who hast taught the bee the secret power 
 of carrying on love 's laws ‘ twixt flower and flower 
 why didst thou shape this mortal frame of mine 
 if heavenly joys alone were thy design 
 wherefore the wonder of my woman 's breast 
 by lips of lover and of babe unpressed 
 if spirit children only shall reply 
 unto my ever urgent mother cry 
 why should the rose be guided to its own 
 and my love craving heart beat on alone 

the clock chimed three , and we yet strayed at will 
 about the yard in morning dishabille 
 when aunt ruth came , with apron o'er her head 
 holding a letter in her hand , and said 
 “ here is a note , from vivian i opine 
 at least his servant brought it . and now , girls 
 you may think this is no concern of mine 
 but in my day young ladies did not go 
 till almost bed time roaming to and fro 
 in morning wrappers , and with tangled curls 
 the very pictures of forlorn distress 
 ‘ tis three o'clock , and time for you to dress 
 come ! read your note and hurry in , maurine 
 and make yourself fit object to be seen 

he ceas 'd ; and old alethes took the word 
 “ our country gods , in whom our trust we place 
 will yet from ruin save the trojan race 
 while we behold such dauntless worth appear 
 in dawning youth , and souls so void of fear 
 then into tears of joy the father broke 
 each in his longing arms by turns he took 
 panted and paus 'd ; and thus again he spoke 
 “ ye brave young men , what equal gifts can we 
 in recompense of such desert , decree 
 the greatest , sure , and best you can receive 
 the gods and your own conscious worth will give 
 the rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow 
 and young ascanius till his manhood owe 

sir alex .— what would you have ? what is it that you wish 
 would ye , for food , sweet friends , become all slaves 
 and for a meal , that ye might surfeit on it 
 give up your wives , your homes , and all that 's dear 
 to the brute arms of men , who hold it virtue 
 to heap their shame upon a fallen foe 
 would ye , that ye might eat , yet not be satisfied 
 pick up the scanty crumbs around their camp 
 after their cattle and their dogs have left them 
 or would ye , for this favour , be content 
 to take up arms against your countrymen 
 for this ! will fathers fight against their sons 
 sons ‘ gainst their fathers ?— brethren with each other 
 those who would wish it may go o'er to edward 

schonbergh , the ablest soldier of his age 
 with great nassau did in our cause engage 
 both join 'd for england 's rescue and defence 
 the greatest captain and the greatest prince 
 with what applause his stories did we tell 
 stories which europe 's volumes largely swell 
 we counted him an army in our aid 
 where he commanded , no man was afraid 
 his actions with a constant conquest shine 
 from villa vitiosa to the rhine 
 france , flanders , germany , his fame confess 
 and all the world was fond of him but us 
 our turn first served , we grudged him the command 
 witness the grateful temper of the land 

but to pursue my tale : to welcome home 
 his warlike brother is pirithous come 
 arcite of thebes was known in arms long since 
 and honoured by this young thessalian prince 
 theseus , to gratify his friend and guest 
 who made our arcite 's freedom his request 
 restored to liberty the captive knight 
 but on these hard conditions i recite 
 that if hereafter arcite should be found 
 within the compass of athenian ground 
 by day or night , or on whate'er pretence 
 his head should pay the forfeit of the offence 
 to this pirithous for his friend agreed 
 and on his promise was the prisoner freed 

far be the guilt of homeshed blood from all 
 on whom , unsought , embroiling dangers fall 
 still the pale dead revives , and lives to me 
 to me ! through pity 's eye condemned to see 
 remembrance veils his rage , but swells his fate 
 grieved i forgive , and am grown cool too late 
 young , and unthoughtful then ; who knows , one day 
 what ripening virtues might have made their way 
 he might have lived till folly died in shame 
 till kindling wisdom felt a thirst for fame 
 he might perhaps his country 's friend have proved 
 both happy , generous , candid , and beloved 
 he might have saved some worth , now doomed to fall 
 and i , perchance , in him , have murdered all 

but hark !— from wood and rock flung back 
 what sound comes up the merrimac 
 what sea worn barks are those which throw 
 the light spray from each rushing prow 
 have they not in the north sea 's blast 
 bowed to the waves the straining mast 
 their frozen sails the low , pale sun 
 of thule 's night has shone upon 
 flapped by the sea wind 's gusty sweep 
 round icy drift , and headland steep 
 wild jutland 's wives and lochlin 's daughters 
 have watched them fading o'er the waters 
 lessening through driving mist and spray 
 like white winged sea birds on their way 

could time , his flight reversed , restore the hours 
 when , playing with thy vesture 's tissued flowers 
 the violet , the pink , the jessamine 
 i pricked them into paper with a pin 
 ( and thou wast happier than myself the while 
 wouldst softly speak , and stroke my head and smile 
 could those few pleasant days again appear 
 might one wish bring them , would i wish them here 
 i would not trust my heart — the dear delight 
 seems so to be desired , perhaps i might 
 but no — what here we call our life is such 
 so little to be loved , and thou so much 
 that i should ill requite thee to constrain 
 thy unbound spirit into bonds again 

i christened you in happier days , before 
 these gray forebodings on my brow were seen 
 you are still lovely in your new leaved green 
 the brimming river soothes his grassy shore 
 the bridge is there ; the rock with lichens hoar 
 and the same shadows on the water lean 
 outlasting us . how many graves between 
 that day and this ! how many shadows more 
 darken my heart , their substance from these eyes 
 hidden forever ! so our world is made 
 of life and death commingled ; and the sighs 
 outweigh the smiles , in equal balance laid 
 what compensation ? none , save that the allwise 
 so schools us to love things that cannot fade 

‘ now turn to different sports ( the goddess cries 
 and learn , my sons , the wondrous power of noise 
 to move , to raise , to ravish every heart 
 with shakspeare 's nature , or with jonson 's art 
 let others aim : ‘ tis yours to shake the soul 
 with thunder rumbling from the mustard bowl 
 with horns and trumpets now to madness swell 
 now sink in sorrows with a tolling bell 
 such happy arts attention can command 
 when fancy flags , and sense is at a stand 
 improve we these . three cat calls be the bribe 
 of him whose chattering shames the monkey tribe 
 and his this drum whose hoarse heroic bass 
 drowns the loud clarion of the braying ass 

“ an upstart multitude and sudden gains 
 pride and excess , o florence ! have in thee 
 engender 'd , so that now in tears thou mourn'st 
 thus cried i with my face uprais 'd , and they 
 all three , who for an answer took my words 
 look 'd at each other , as men look when truth 
 comes to their ear . “ if thou at other times 
 they all at once rejoin 'd , “ so easily 
 satisfy those , who question , happy thou 
 gifted with words , so apt to speak thy thought 
 wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime 
 returning to behold the radiant stars 
 when thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past 
 see that of us thou speak among mankind 

t. since , in plain terms , ‘ tis poverty you fear 
 and riches are your aim , attend and hear 
 suppose a thrush or other dainty placed 
 at your disposal , for your private taste 
 speed it to some great house , all gems and gold 
 where means are ample , and their master old 
 your choicest apples , ripe and full of juice 
 and whatsoe'er your garden may produce 
 before they 're offered at the lares ’ shrine 
 give them to your rich friend , as more divine 
 be he a branded slave , forsworn , distained 
 with brother 's blood , in short , a rogue ingrained 
 yet walk , if asked , beside him when you meet 
 and ( pray mind this ) between him and the street 

ah ! colin , whether on the lowly plaine 
 piping to shepheards thy sweet roundelayes 
 or whether singing , in some loftie vaine 
 heroicke deeds of past or present dayes 
 or whether in thy lovely mistresse praise 
 thou list to exercise thy learned quill 
 thy muse hath got such grace and power to please 
 with rare invention , beautified by skill 
 as who therin can ever ioy their fill 
 o , therefore let that happy muse proceed 
 to clime the height of vertues sacred hill 
 where endlesse honour shal be made thy meed 
 because no malice of succeeding dales 
 can rase those records of thy lasting praise 

the first time that the sun rose on thine oath 
 to love me , i looked forward to the moon 
 to slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon 
 and quickly tied to make a lasting troth 
 quick loving hearts , i thought , may quickly loathe 
 and , looking on myself , i seemed not one 
 for such man 's love !— more like an out of tune 
 worn viol , a good singer would be wroth 
 to spoil his song with , and which , snatched in haste 
 is laid down at the first ill sounding note 
 i did not wrong myself so , but i placed 
 a wrong on thee . for perfect strains may float 
 ‘ neath master hands , from instruments defaced 
 and great souls , at one stroke , may do and doat 

“ peace with honour , ” glorious , joy lit words 
 britons , lay down your arms , re sheath your swords 
 for the red demon war lies foiled and chained 
 and britain 's prestige is anew proclaimed 
 with re united europe , grateful raise 
 to heaven glad paeans of exultant praise 
 for see , crest fallen strife , abashed , retreats 
 as berlin 's congress her design defeats 
 while justice , peace and hope effulgent stand

 such heaven born guests lend to your council aid

 that ye your heaven blest flag of peace unfurled 

long time a child , and still a child , when years 
 had painted manhood on my check , was i 
 for yet i lived like one not born to die 
 a thriftless prodigal of smiles and tears 
 no hope i needed , and i knew no fears 
 but sleep , though sweet , is only sleep ; and waking 
 i waked to sleep no more ; at once o'ertaking 
 the vanguard of my age , with all arrears 
 of duty on my back . nor child , nor man 
 nor youth , nor sage , i find my head is gray 
 for i have lost the race i never ran 
 a rathe december blights my lagging may 
 and still i am a child , though i be old 
 time is my debtor for my years untold 

i am afraid , oh i am so afraid 
 the cold black fear is clutching me to night 
 as long ago when they would take the light 
 and leave the little child who would have prayed 
 frozen and sleepless at the thought of death 
 my heart that beats too fast will rest too soon 
 i shall not know if it be night or noon 
 yet shall i struggle in the dark for breath 
 will no one fight the terror for my sake 
 the heavy darkness that no dawn will break 
 how can they leave me in that dark alone 
 who loved the joy of light and warmth so much 
 and thrilled so with the sense of sound and touch 
 how can they shut me underneath a stone 

milton ! thou should'st be living at this hour 
 england hath need of thee : she is a fen 
 of stagnant waters ; altar , sword , and pen 
 fireside , the heroic wealth of hall and bower 
 have forfeited their ancient english dower 
 of inward happiness . we are selfish men 
 oh ! raise us up , return to us again 
 and give us manners , virtue , freedom , power 
 thy soul was like a star , and dwelt apart 
 thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea 
 pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free 
 so didst thou travel on life 's common way 
 in cheerful godliness ; and yet thy heart 
 the lowliest duties on herself did lay 

when first the sun whom all my senses serve 
 began to shine upon this earthly round 
 the heavens for her all graces did reserve 
 that pandor like with all she might abound 
 apollo placed his brightness in her eyes 
 his skill presaging and his music sweet 
 mars gave his force ; all force she now defies 
 venus her smiles wherewith she mars did meet 
 python a voice , diana made her chaste 
 ceres gave plenty , cupid lent his bow 
 thetis his feet , there pallas wisdom placed 
 with these she queen like kept a world in awe 
 yet all these honors deem è d are but pelf 
 for she is much more worthy of herself 

are you still doubtful of me — hesitant still 
 fearful , perhaps , that i may yet remember 
 what you would gladly , if you could , forget 
 you were unfaithful once , you met your lover 
 still in your heart you bear that red eyed ember 
 and i was silent ,— you remember my silence yet 
 you knew , as well as i , i could not kill him 
 nor touch him with hot hands , nor yet with hate 
 no , and it was not you i saw with anger 
 instead , i rose and beat at steel walled fate 
 cried till i lay exhausted , sick , unfriended 
 that life , so seeming sure , and love , so certain 
 should loose such tricks , be so abruptly ended 
 ring down so suddenly an unlooked for curtain 

doge . i knew my heart would never treat you harshly 
 i knew my days could not disturb you long 
 and then the daughter of my earliest friend 
 his worthy daughter , free to choose again 
 wealthier and wiser , in the ripest bloom 
 of womanhood , more skilful to select 
 by passing these probationary years 
 inheriting a prince 's name and riches 
 secured , by the short penance of enduring 
 an old man for some summers , against all 
 that law 's chicane or envious kinsmen might 
 have urged against her right ; my best friend 's child 
 would choose more fitly in respect of years 
 and not less truly in a faithful heart 

some prouder muse , when comes the hour at last 
 may shake our hillsides with her bugle blast 
 not ours the task ; but since the lyric dress 
 relieves the statelier with its sprightliness 
 hear an old song , which some , perchance , have seen 
 in stale gazette or cobwebbed magazine 
 there was an hour when patriots dared profane 
 the mast that britain strove to bow in vain 
 and one , who listened to the tale of shame 
 whose heart still answered to that sacred name 
 whose eye still followed o'er his country 's tides 
 thy glorious flag , our brave old ironsides 
 from yon lone attic , on a smiling morn 
 thus mocked the spoilers with his school boy scorn 

when erst her hand the crust of chaos thirl 'd 
 and forced from his black breast the bursting world 
 high swell 'd the huge existence crude and crass 
 a formless dark impermeated mass 
 no light nor heat nor cold nor moist nor dry 
 but all concocting in their causes lie 
 millions of periods , such as these her spheres 
 learn since to measure and to call their years 
 she broods the mass ; then into motion brings 
 and seeks and sorts the principles of things 
 pours in the attractive and repulsive force 
 whirls forth her globes in cosmogyral course 
 by myriads and by millions , scaled sublime 
 to scoop their skies , and curve the rounds of time 

‘ tis gross to squander hundreds upon fish 
 yet pen them cooked within too small a dish 
 so too it turns the stomach , if there sticks 
 dirt to the bowl wherein your wine you mix 
 or if the servant , who behind you stands 
 has fouled the beaker with his greasy hands 
 brooms , dish cloths , saw dust , what a mite they cost 
 neglect them though , your reputation 's lost 
 what ? sweep with dirty broom a floor inlaid 
 spread unwashed cloths o'er tapestry and brocade 
 forgetting , sure , the less such things entail 
 of care and cost , the more the shame to fail 
 worse than fall short in luxuries , which one sees 
 at no man 's table but your rich grandees 

her quivering fins and panting gills she hides 
 but spreads her silver arms upon the tides 
 205 slow as she sails , her ivory neck she laves 
 and shakes her golden tresses o'er the waves 
 charm 'd round the nymph , in circling gambols glide 
 four nereid forms , or shoot along the tide 
 now all as one they rise with frolic spring 
 210 and beat the wondering air on humid wing 
 now all descending plunge beneath the main 
 and lash the foam with undulating train 
 above , below , they wheel , retreat , advance 
 in air and ocean weave the mazy dance 
 215 bow their quick heads , and point their diamond eyes 
 and twinkle to the sun with ever changing dyes 

from these digressions upon love and glory 
 ‘ tis time we were returning to our story 
 i only meant , in a few words , to tell you 
 ( for fear my heroine 's conduct should repel you 
 that if she jests , for instance , out of season 
 perhaps there is a good substantial reason 
 sir gawayne , had he seen the stranger wink 
 and seen the lady blushing , you may think 
 might have been spared a most unhappy lot 
 perhaps you 're right ;— but peradventure not 
 i give you but a hint , for half the art 
 of narrative is holding back a part 
 and if without reserve i gave my best 
 in the first canto , who would read the rest 

an ill march noon ; the flagstones gray with dust 
 an all round east wind volleying straws and grit 
 st. martin 's steps , where every venomous gust 
 lingers to buffet , or sneap , the passing cit 
 and in the gutter , squelching a rotten boot 
 draped in a wrap that , modish ten year syne 
 partners , obscene with sweat and grease and soot 
 a horrible hat , that once was just as fine 
 the drunkard 's mouth a wash for something drinkable 
 the drunkard 's eye alert for casual toppers 
 the drunkard 's neck stooped to a lot scarce thinkable 
 a living , crawling blazoning of hot coppers 
 he trails his mildews towards a kingdom come 
 compact of sausage and mash and two o ’ rum 

like as the spotless ermelin distressed 
 circumpassed round with filth and lothsome mud 
 pines in her grief , imprisoned to her nest 
 and cannot issue forth to seek her good 
 so i invironed with a hatefull want 
 look to the heavens ; the heavens yield forth no grace 
 i search the earth , the earth i find as scant 
 i view myself , myself in wofull case 
 heaven nor earth will not , myself cannot make 
 a way through want to free my soul from care 
 but i must pine , and in my pining lurk 
 lest my sad looks bewray me how i fare 
 my fortune mantled with a cloud s'obscure 
 thus shades my life so long as wants endure 

england ! the time is come when thou should'st wean 
 thy heart from its emasculating food 
 the truth should now be better understood 
 old things have been unsettled ; we have seen 
 fair seed time , better harvest might have been 
 but for thy trespasses ; and , at this day 
 if for greece , egypt , india , africa 
 aught good were destined , thou would'st step between 
 england ! all nations in this charge agree 
 but worse , more ignorant in love and hate 
 far — far more abject , is thine enemy 
 therefore the wise pray for thee , though the freight 
 of thy offences be a heavy weight 
 oh grief that earth 's best hopes rest all with thee 

and again he pointed across the sea 
 and another vision arose in me 
 and i knew i walked an ocean of fear 
 yet of safety too , for the master was near 
 and every wave of sorrow or dread 
 o'er which strong faith should upraise my head 
 would show from the height of its troubled crest 
 still nearer and nearer the land of rest 
 and when the storm spray on the wind should arise 
 and with tears unbidden should blind mine eyes 
 and hide from my vision the home of love 
 i knew i must look to the star above 
 and the mists of passion would quickly flee 
 and the storm would faint to serenity 

nymph of the downward smile , and sidelong glance 
 in what diviner moments of the day 
 art thou most lovely ? when gone far astray 
 into the labyrinths of sweet utterance 
 or when serenely wand'ring in a trance 
 of sober thought ? or when starting away 
 with careless robe , to meet the morning ray 
 thou spar'st the flowers in thy mazy dance 
 haply ‘ tis when thy ruby lips part sweetly 
 and so remain , because thou listenest 
 but thou to please wert nurtured so completely 
 that i can never tell what mood is best 
 i shall as soon pronounce which grace more neatly 
 trips it before apollo than the rest 

receive thine own ; for i and it are thine 
 thou know'st its story ; how for forty days 
 weary with sickness and with social haze 
 ( after thy hands and lips with love divine 
 had somewhat soothed me , made the glory shine 
 though with a watery lustre ,) more delays 
 of blessedness forbid — i took my ways 
 into a solitude , invention 's mine 
 there thought and wrote , afar , and yet with thee 
 those days gone past , i came , and brought a book 
 my child , developed since in limb and look 
 it came in shining vapours from the sea 
 and in thy stead sung low sweet songs to me 
 when the red life blood labour would not brook 

leave , lady ! in your glasse of cristall clene 
 your goodly selfe for evermore to vew 
 and in my selfe , ( my inward selfe i meane 
 most lively lyke behold your semblant trew 
 within my hart , though hardly it can shew 
 thing so divine to vew of earthly eye 
 the fayre idea of your celestiall hew 
 and every part remaines immortally 
 and were it not that through your cruelty 
 with sorrow dimmed and deform 'd it were 
 the goodly ymage of your visnomy 
 clearer than cristall , would therein appere 
 but if your selfe in me ye playne will see 
 remove the cause by which your fayre beames darkned be 

i dream of you to wake : would that i might 
 dream of you and not wake but slumber on 
 nor find with dreams the dear companion gone 
 as summer ended summer birds take flight 
 in happy dreams i hold you full in sight 
 i blush again who waking look so wan 
 brighter than sunniest day that ever shone 
 in happy dreams your smile makes day of night 
 thus only in a dream we are at one 
 thus only in a dream we give and take 
 the faith that maketh rich who take or give 
 if thus to sleep is sweeter than to wake 
 to die were surely sweeter than to live 
 though there be nothing new beneath the sun 

then still abiding in that ensign rang 'd 
 wherewith the romans over awed the world 
 those burning splendours of the holy spirit 
 took up the strain ; and thus it spake again 
 “ none ever hath ascended to this realm 
 who hath not a believer been in christ 
 either before or after the blest limbs 
 were nail 'd upon the wood . but lo ! of those 
 who call ‘ christ , christ , ’ there shall be many found 
 in judgment , further off from him by far 
 than such , to whom his name was never known 
 christians like these the ethiop shall condemn 
 when that the two assemblages shall part 
 one rich eternally , the other poor 

the passing traveller with wonder sees 
 a deep and ancient stonepit full of trees 
 so deep and very deep the place has been 
 the church might stand within and not be seen 
 the passing stranger oft with wonder stops 
 and thinks he een could walk upon their tops 
 and often stoops to see the busy crow 
 and stands above and sees the eggs below 
 and while the wild horse gives its head a toss 
 the squirrel dances up and runs across 
 the boy that stands and kills the black nosed bee 
 dares down as soon as magpies ’ nests are found 
 and wonders when he climbs the highest tree 
 to find it reaches scarce above the ground 

friend of my peaceful days ! substantial friend 
 whom wealth can never change , nor int'rest bend 
 i love thee like a child . thou wert to me 
 the dumb companion of my misery 
 and oftner of my joys ;— then as i spoke 
 i shar 'd thy sympathy , old heart of oak 
 for surely when my labour ceas 'd at night 
 with trembling , feverish hands , and aching sight 
 the draught that cheer 'd me and subdu 'd my care 
 on thy broad shoulders thou wert proud to bear 
 o'er thee , with expectation 's fire elate 
 i 've sat and ponder 'd on my future fate 
 on thee , with winter muffins for thy store 
 i 've lean 'd , and quite forgot that i was poor 

is it for fear to wet a widow 's eye 
 that thou consum'st thy self in single life 
 ah , if thou issueless shalt hap to die 
 the world will wail thee like a makeless wife 
 the world will be thy widow and still weep 
 that thou no form of thee hast left behind 
 when every private widow well may keep 
 by children 's eyes , her husband 's shape in mind 
 look what an unthrift in the world doth spend 
 shifts but his place , for still the world enjoys it 
 but beauty 's waste hath in the world an end 
 and kept unused the user so destroys it 
 no love toward others in that bosom sits 
 that on himself such murd'rous shame commits 

thou art a perfect sovereign , oh my god 
 and i rejoice to think that thou art so 
 that all events are under thy control 
 and that thou knowest all i think and do 
 but some may ask , “ then why am i to blame 
 because i sin , if god hath made me thus 
 stop , stop , my friend , god tempteth not to sin 
 thou dost it of thy own free will and choice 
 though god is sovereign , we free agents are 
 accountable to him for all we do 
 feel , think , or say ; and at the last great day 
 a most exact account must render too 
 with this conclusion be thou satisfied 
 for all who will accept him , christ hath died 

well , that 's the charge . and now i 'm here alone 
 i 've built a little wall of hun on hun 
 to shield me from the leaden bees that drone 
 ( it saves me worry , and it hurts ‘ em none 
 the only thing i 'm wondering is when 
 some stretcher men will stroll along my way 
 it is n't much that 's left of me , but then 
 where life is , hope is , so at least they say 
 well , if i 'm spared i 'll be the happy lad 
 i tell you i wo n't envy any king 
 i 've stood the racket , and i 'm proud and glad 
 i 've had my crowning hour . oh , war 's the thing 
 it gives us common , working chaps our chance 
 a taste of glory , chivalry , romance 

the sky overhead with lowering clouds is cast 
 which anu in his rage above them massed 
 dark tempests fly above from rimmon 's breath 
 who hovers o'er them with the gods of death 
 the wicked seven winds howl wildly round 
 and crashing cedars falling shake the ground 
 now tsil lattu her black wings spreads o'er all 
 dark shrouding all the forest with her pall 
 and from his steed for safety each dismounts 
 and o'er their heads now break the ebon founts 
 but hark ! what is that dreadful roaring noise 
 the dragons come ! their flaming crests they poise 
 above , and nearer blaze their eyes of fire 
 and see ! upon them rush the monsters dire 

too long the crucifix on calvary 's height 
 has cast its shadow on the human heart 
 let now religion 's great co worker art 
 limn on the background of departing night 
 the shining face all palpitant with light 
 and god 's true message to the world impart 
 go tell each toiler in the home and mart 
 ‘ lo , christ is with ye , if ye seek aright 
 the world forgets the vital word christ taught 
 the only word the world has need to know 
 the answer to creation 's problem — love 
 the world remembers what the christ forgot 
 his cross of anguish and his death of woe 
 release the martyr , and the cross remove 

great god whom i shall carve from this gray stone 
 wherein thou liest , hid to all but me 
 grant thou that when my art hath made thee known 
 and others bow , i shall not worship thee 
 but , as i pray thee now , then let me pray 
 some greater god , — like thee to be conceived 
 within my soul , — for strength to turn away 
 from his new altar , when , that task achieved 
 he , too , stands manifest . yea , let me yearn 
 from dream to grander dream ! let me not rest 
 content at any goal ! still bid me spurn 
 each transient triumph on the eternal quest 
 abjuring godlings whom my hand hath made 
 for deity , revealed , but unportrayed 

when i 've eat my fill and my belt is snug 
 i begin to think of my baccy plug 
 i whittle a fill in my horny palm 
 and the bowl of me old clay pipe i cram 
 i trim the edges , i tamp it down 
 i nurse a light with an anxious frown 
 i begin to draw , and my cheeks tuck in 
 and all my face is a blissful grin 
 and up in a cloud the good smoke goes 
 and the good pipe glimmers and fades and glows 
 in its throat it chuckles a cheery song 
 for i likes it hot and i likes it strong 
 oh , it 's good is grub when you 're feeling hollow 
 but the best of a meal 's the smoke to follow 

of an athenian young man have i read 
 who on blind fortune 's picture doated so 
 that when he could not buy it to his bed 
 on it he gazing died for very woe 
 my fortune 's picture art thou , flinty dame 
 that settest golden apples to my sight 
 but wilt by no means let me taste the same 
 to drown in sight of land is double spite 
 of fortune as thou learn'dst to be unkind 
 so learn to be unconstant to disdain 
 the wittiest women are to sport inclined 
 honour is pride , and pride is nought but pain 
 let others boast of choosing for the best 
 ‘ tis substances not names must make us blest 

for shelter here , to shun the noonday heat 
 an airy nation of the flies retreat 
 some in soft air their silken pinions ply 
 and some from bough to bough delighted fly 
 some rise , and circling light to perch again 
 a pleasing murmur hums along the plain 
 so , when a stage invites to pageant shows 
 ( if great and small are like ) appear the beaux 
 in boxes some with spruce pretension sit 
 some change from seat to seat within the pit 
 some roam the scenes , or turning cease to roam 
 preluding music fills the lofty dome 
 when thus a fly ( if what a fly can say 
 deserves attention ) raised the rural lay 

when i perceive love 's heavenly reaping still 
 regard perforce the clouds ’ vicissitude 
 that the fixed spirit loves not when it will 
 but craves its seasons of the flawful blood 
 when i perceive that the high poet doth 
 oft voiceless stray beneath the uninfluent stars 
 that even urania of her kiss is loath 
 and song 's brave wings fret on their sensual bars 
 when i perceived the fullest sail ed sprite 
 lag at most need upon the leth ed seas 
 the provident captainship oft voided quite 
 and lam ed lie deep draughted argosies 
 i scorn myself , that put for such strange toys 
 the wit of man to purposes of boys 

and there she would have lain for evermore 
 a marble image on the shadowy shore 
 in outward seeming , but within oppressed 
 with torments , knowing neither hope nor rest 
 but as she lay the phoenix flew along 
 going to egypt , and knew all her wrong 
 and pitied her , beholding her sweet face 
 and flew to love and told him of her case 
 and love , in guerdon of the tale he told 
 changed all the feathers of his neck to gold 
 and he flew on to egypt glad at heart 
 but love himself gat swiftly for his part 
 to rocky t æ narus , and found her there 
 laid half a furlong from the outer air 

but enoch yearn 'd to see her face again 
 ‘ if i might look on her sweet face again 
 and know that she is happy . ’ so the thought 
 haunted and harass 'd him , and drove him forth 
 at evening when the dull november day 
 was growing duller twilight , to the hill 
 there he sat down gazing on all below 
 there did a thousand memories roll upon him 
 unspeakable for sadness . by and by 
 the ruddy square of comfortable light 
 far blazing from the rear of philip 's house 
 allured him , as the beacon blaze allures 
 the bird of passage , till he madly strikes 
 against it , and beats out his weary life 

being one day at my window all alone 
 so manie strange things happened me to see 
 as much it grieveth me to thinke thereon 
 at my right hand a hynde appear 'd to mee 
 so faire as mote the greatest god delite 
 two eager dogs did her pursue in chace 
 of which the one was blacke , the other white 
 with deadly force so in their cruell race 
 they pincht the haunches of that gentle beast 
 that at the last , and in short time , i spide 
 under a rocke , where she , alas ! opprest 
 fell to the ground , and there untimely dide 
 cruell death vanquishing so noble beautie 
 oft makes me wayle so hard a destenie 

a smile is curving o'er her creamy cheek 
 her bosom swells with all a lover 's joy 
 when love receives a message that the coy 
 young love god made a strong and true heart speak 
 from far off lands ; and like a mountain peak 
 that loses in one avalanche its cloy 
 of ice and snow , so doth her breast employ 
 its hidden store of blushes ; and they wreak 
 destruction , as they crush my aching heart 
 destruction , wild , relentless , and as sure 
 as the poor alpine hamlet 's ; and no art 
 can hide my agony , no herb can cure 
 my wound . her very blush says , “ we must part 
 why was it always my fate to endure 

“ i do beseech thee , god , show me thy face 
 “ come up to me in sinai on the morn 
 thou shalt behold as much as may be borne 
 and moses on a rock stood lone in space 
 from sinai 's top , the vaporous , thunderous place 
 god passed in clouds , an earthly garment worn 
 to hide , and thus reveal . in love , not scorn 
 he put him in a cleft in the rock 's base 
 covered him with his hand , his eyes to screen 
 then passed , and showed his back through mists of years 
 ah , moses ! had he turned , and hadst thou seen 
 the pale face crowned with thorns , baptized with tears 
 the eyes of the true man , by men belied 
 thou hadst beheld god 's face , and straightway died 

in fancy 's world an atlas have i been 
 where yet the chaos of my ceaseless care 
 is by her eyes unpitied and unseen 
 in whom all gifts but pity planted are 
 for mercy though still cries my moan clad muse 
 and every paper that she sends to beauty 
 in tract of sable tears brings woeful news 
 of my true heart kind thoughts , and loyal duty 
 but ah the strings of her hard heart are strained 
 beyond the harmony of my desires 
 and though the happy heavens themselves have pained 
 to tame her heart whose will so far aspires 
 yet she who claims the title of world 's wonder 
 thinks all deserts too base to bring her under 

but oh ! thou bitter step mother and hard 
 to thy poor , fenceless , naked child — the bard 
 a thing unteachable in world 's skill 
 and half an idiot too , more helpless still 
 no heels to bear him from the op'ning dun 
 no claws to dig , his hated sight to shun 
 no horns , but those by luckless hymen worn 
 and those , alas ! not , amalthea 's horn 
 no nerves olfact'ry , mammon 's trusty cur 
 clad in rich dulness ’ comfortable fur 
 in naked feeling , and in aching pride 
 he bears th ’ unbroken blast from ev'ry side 
 vampyre booksellers drain him to the heart 
 and scorpion critics cureless venom dart 

five hundred danish youths this post maintain 'd 
 to fight alike , and hardy ravage train 'd 
 prepared the fiercest mountain host to dare 
 and dash from many a battlement the war 
 prepared to hurl the whizzing lance , to pour 
 the missive flame , or dart the arrowy shower 
 young eric the selected squadron led 
 count bernheim 's son , in camps and contests bred 
 a fiery spirit , never at a stay 
 with martial projects teeming night and day 
 alike by terror , pity , and remorse 
 untouch 'd , he held , thro ’ crimes , his fearless course 
 proud , like his king , to conquer and oppress 
 in action rash , and haughty with success 

but first , by reason let me prove , i pray 
 that evil such as this , and which you say 
 oft weighs you down with soul corroding care 
 is only in the mind :— mere spright of air 
 your hat upon your head for instance place 
 less gently rather than 's your usual case 
 pray , do n't it presently at ease remain 
 and from it do you aught amiss retain 
 not e'en a spot ; there 's nothing half so clear 
 the features , too , they as before appear 
 no difference assuredly you see 
 then how can cuckoldom an evil be 
 such my conclusion , spite of fools or brutes 
 with whose ideas reason never suits 

most strength the moving principle requires 
 active its task , it prompts , impels , inspires 
 sedate and quiet the comparing lies 
 form 'd but to check , deliberate , and advise 
 self love , still stronger , as its objects nigh 
 reason 's at distance , and in prospect lie 
 that sees immediate good by present sense 
 reason , the future and the consequence 
 thicker than arguments , temptations throng 
 at best more watchful this , but that more strong 
 the action of the stronger to suspend 
 reason still use , to reason still attend 
 attention , habit and experience gains 
 each strengthens reason , and self love restrains 

hope , like the hyaena , coming to be old 
 alters his shape , is turned into despair 
 pity my hoary hopes , maid of clear mould 
 think not that frowns can ever make thee fair 
 what harm is it to kiss , to laugh , to play 
 beauty 's no blossom , if it be not used 
 sweet dalliance keeps the wrinkles long away 
 repentance follows them that have refused 
 to bring you to the knowledge of your good 
 i seek , i sue . o try and then believe 
 each image can be chaste that 's carved of wood 
 you show you live , when men you do relieve 
 iron with wearing shines ; rust wasteth treasure 
 on earth but love there is no other pleasure 

friend of the dead , and friend of all my days 
 even since they cast off boyhood , i salute 
 the song saluting friends whose songs are mute 
 with full burnt offerings of clear spirited praise 
 that since our old young years our several ways 
 have led through fields diverse of flower and fruit 
 yet no cross wind has once relaxed the root 
 we set long since beneath the sundawn 's rays 
 the root of trust whence towered the trusty tree 
 friendship — this only and duly might impel 
 my song to salutation of your own 
 more even than praise of one unseen of me 
 and loved — the starry spirit of dobell 
 to mine by light and music only known 

mary ! i want a lyre with other strings 
 such aid from heaven as some have feigned they drew 
 an eloquence scarce given to mortals , new 
 and undebased by praise of meaner things 
 that , ere through age or woe i shed my wings 
 i may record thy worth with honor due 
 in verse as musical as thou art true 
 and that immortalizes whom it sings 
 but thou hast little need . there is a book 
 by seraphs writ with beams of heavenly light 
 on which the eyes of god not rarely look 
 a chronicle of actions just and bright 
 there all thy deeds , my faithful mary , shine 
 and , since thou own'st that praise , i spare thee mine

each day , new proofs of new despair i find 
 that is , new deaths . no marvel then , though i 
 make exile my last help ; to th'end mine eye 
 should not behold the death to me assigned 
 not that from death absence might save my mind 
 but that it might take death more patiently 
 like him , the which by judge condemned to die 
 to suffer with more ease , his eyes doth blind 
 your lips in scarlet clad , my judges be 
 pronouncing sentence of eternal “ no

 the death i suffer is the life i have 
 for only life doth make me die in woe 
 and only death i for my pardon crave 

the matron woo 'd her kindness to the last 
 but could not win ; her hour of grace was past 
 whom , thus persisting , when she could not bring 
 to leave the wolf , and to believe her king 
 she gave her up , and fairly wish 'd her joy 
 of her late treaty with her new ally 
 which well she hoped would more successful prove 
 than was the pigeon 's and the buzzard 's love 
 the panther ask 'd what concord there could be 
 betwixt two kinds whose natures disagree 
 the dame replied : ‘ tis sung in every street 
 the common chat of gossips when they meet 
 but , since unheard by you , ‘ tis worth your while 
 to take a wholesome tale , though told in homely style 

the old house totters ‘ neath its weight of years 
 bowed , like the form of him who shelters there 
 old , friendless , lone — save for the wanton , care 
 who flouts him , mocks his grief with gibes and jeers 
 and laughs to see his piteous hopes grow fears 
 not his the joy of placid , sun crowned age 
 his dim eyes falter as he scans the page 
 of life 's worn album , blotted with his tears 
 he sees in dreams the wife he loved — long dead 
 the son — once proud to bear his father 's name 
 who mixed his honest blood with dire disgrace 
 the wayward girl who wrought her father shame 
 he sits alone with care ; the day has fled 
 and twilight falls , upon the furrowed face 

what do we see ? is cato then become 
 a greater name in britain than in rome 
 does mankind now admire his virtues more 
 though lucan , horace , virgil , wrote before 
 how will posterity this truth explain 
 “ cato begins to live in anna ’ s reign 
 the world ’ s great chiefs , in council or in arms 
 rise in your lines with more exalted charms 
 illustrious deeds in distant nations wrought 
 and virtues by departed heroes taught 
 raise in your soul a pure immortal flame 
 adorn your life , and consecrate your fame 
 to your renown all ages you subdue 
 and c æ sar fought , and cato bled for you 

young pleasures sporting in luxurious ease 
 and infant cupid 's on his amour seize 
 some dragg 'd the bloody cuirass o'er the ground 
 305 or from his thigh , the pond'rous blade unbound 
 some from the casque the crystal torrent pour 'd 
 to wash the crimson spot that stain 'd the sword 
 and laugh as in their feeble hand they wield 
 the crown 's support , the terror of the field

death ! be not proud , though some have called thee 
 mighty and dreadful , for thou art not so 
 for those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow 
 die not , poor death ! nor yet canst thou kill me 
 from rest and sleep , which but thy picture be 
 much pleasure , then , from thee much more must flow 
 and soonest our best men with thee do go 
 rest of their bones , and soul 's delivery 
 thou'rt slave to fate , chance , kings , and desperate men 
 and dost with poison , war , and sickness , dwell 
 and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well 
 and better than thy stroke . why swell'st thou , then 
 one short sleep past we wake eternally 
 and death shall be no more ; death , thou shalt die 

men see their god , an immanence divine 
 smile through the curve of flesh or moulded clay 
 in bare ploughed lands that go sloping away 
 to meet the sky in one clean exquisite line 
 out of the short seen dawns of ecstasy 
 they draw new beauty , whence new thoughts are born 
 and in their turn conceive , as grains of corn 
 germ and create new life and endlessly 
 shall live creating . out of earthly seeds 
 springs the aerial flower . one spirit proceeds 
 through change , the same in body and in soul 
 the spirit of life and love that triumphs still 
 in its slow struggle towards some far off goal 
 through lust and death and the bitterness of will 

the laurel leafe which you this day doe weare 
 gives me great hope of your relenting mynd 
 for since it is the badge which i doe beare 
 ye , bearing it , doe seeme to me inclind 
 the powre thereof , which ofte in me i find 
 let it likewise your gentle brest inspire 
 with sweet infusion , and put you in mind 
 of that proud mayd whom now those leaves attyre 
 proud daphne , scorning phrebus lovely ** fyre 
 on the thessalian shore from him did flie 
 for which the gods , in theyr revengefull yre 
 did her transforme into a laurell tree 
 then fly no more , fayre love , from phebus chace 
 but in your brest his leafe and love embrace 

there shall he lie dispersed amid great riches 
 such gold , such arrogance , so many bold hearts 
 all the sunken armadas pressed to powder 
 by weight of incredible seas ! that mingled wrack 
 no livening sun shall visit till the crust 
 of earth be riven , or this rolling planet 
 reel on its axis ; till the moon chained tides 
 unloosed , deliver up that white atlantis 
 whose naked peaks shall bleach above the slaked 
 thirst of sahara , fringed by weedy tangles 
 of atlas 's drown 'd cedars , frowning eastward 
 to where the sands of india lie cold 
 and heap 'd himalaya 's a rib of coral 
 slowly uplifted , grain on grain 

iii . heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate 
 all but the page prescribed , their present state 
 from brutes what men , from men what spirits know 
 or who could suffer being here below 
 the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day 
 had he thy reason , would he skip and play 
 pleased to the last , he crops the flowery food 
 and licks the hand just raised to shed his blood 
 oh blindness to the future ! kindly given 
 that each may fill the circle mark 'd by heaven 
 who sees with equal eye , as god of all 
 a hero perish , or a sparrow fall 
 atoms or systems into ruin hurl 'd 
 and now a bubble burst , and now a world 

always we are following a light 
 always the light recedes ; with groping hands 
 we stretch toward this glory , while the lands 
 we journey through are hidden from our sight 
 dim and mysterious , folded deep in night 
 we care not , all our utmost need demands 
 is but the light , the light ! so still it stands 
 surely our own if we exert our might 
 fool ! never can'st thou grasp this fleeting gleam 
 its glowing flame would die if it were caught 
 its value is that it doth always seem 
 but just a little farther on . distraught 
 but lighted ever onward , we are brought 
 upon our way unknowing , in a dream 

rid of the world 's injustice , and his pain 
 he rests at last beneath god 's veil of blue 
 taken from life when life and love were new 
 the youngest of the martyrs here is lain 
 fair as sebastian , and as early slain 
 no cypress shades his grave , no funeral yew 
 but gentle violets weeping with the dew 
 weave on his bones an ever blossoming chain 
 o proudest heart that broke for misery 
 o sweetest lips since those of mitylene 
 o poet painter of our english land 
 thy name was writ in water — it shall stand 
 and tears like mine will keep thy memory green 
 as isabella did her basil tree 

less bronze , more silver , mingles in the mould 
 of him whom next my roving eyes behold 
 his , more the scholar 's than the statesman 's face 
 proclaims him born of academic race 
 weary his look , as if an aching brain 
 left on his brow the frozen prints of pain 
 his voice far reaching , grave , sonorous , owns 
 a shade of sadness in its plaintive tones 
 yet when its breath some loftier thought inspires 
 glows with a heat that every bosom fires 
 such everett seems ; no chance sown wild flower knows 
 the full blown charms of culture 's double rose 
 alas , how soon , by death 's unsparing frost 
 its bloom is faded and its fragrance lost 

by night close bolted in the bagnio 's gloom 
 think how they ponder on their dreadful doom 
 recal the tender sire , the weeping bride 
 the home , far sunder 'd by a waste of tide 
 brood all the ties that once endear 'd them there 
 but now , strung stronger , edge their keen despair 
 till here a fouler fiend arrests their pace 
 plague , with his burning breath and bloated face 
 with saffron eyes that thro the dungeon shine 
 and the black tumors bursting from the groin 
 stalks o'er the slave ; who , cowering on the sod 
 shrinks from the demon and invokes his god 
 sucks hot contagion with his quivering breath 
 and , rack 'd with rending torture , sinks in death 

“ not without purpose once more to return 
 thou find'st me , my casella , where i am 
 journeying this way ; ” i said , “ but how of thee 
 hath so much time been lost ? ” he answer 'd straight 
 “ no outrage hath been done to me , if he 
 who when and whom he chooses takes , me oft 
 this passage hath denied , since of just will 
 his will he makes . these three months past indeed 
 he , whose chose to enter , with free leave 
 hath taken ; whence i wand'ring by the shore 
 where tyber 's wave grows salt , of him gain 'd kind 
 admittance , at that river 's mouth , tow'rd which 
 his wings are pointed , for there always throng 
 all such as not to archeron descend 

this is my play 's last scene ; here heavens appoint 
 my pilgrimage 's last mile ; and my race 
 idly yet quickly run , hath this last pace 
 my span 's last inch , my minute 's latest point 
 and gluttonous death will instantly unjoint 
 my body and soul , and i shall sleep a space 
 but my ever waking part shall see that face 
 whose fear already shakes my every joint 
 then as my soul to heaven , her first seat , takes flight 
 and earth born body in the earth shall dwell 
 so fall my sins , that all may have their right 
 to where they 're bred , and would press me to hell 
 impute me righteous ; thus purged of evil 
 for thus i leave the world , the flesh , the devil 

and thou from heaven 's wrath , and ocean 's waves 
 that bellowed round the cloud capped mountain tops 
 the sinful brood didst save ; thou , unto whom 
 from the dark air and wave encumbered hills 
 the white dove brought the sign of hope renewed 
 and sinking in the west , the shipwrecked sun 
 his bright rays darting through the angry clouds 
 the dark sky painted with the lovely bow 
 the race restored , to earth returned , begins anew 
 the same career of wickedness and lust 
 with their attendant ills . audacious man 
 defies the threats of the avenging sea 
 and to new shores and to new stars repeats 
 the same sad tale of infamy and woe 

whilst youth and error led my wandering mind 
 and set my thoughts in heedless ways to range 
 all unawares a goddess chaste i find 
 diana like , to work my sudden change 
 for her , no sooner had mine eye bewrayed 
 but with disdain to see me in that place 
 with fairest hand the sweet unkindest maid 
 casts water cold disdain upon my face 
 which turned my sport into a hart 's despair 
 which still is chased , while i have any breath 
 by mine own thoughts set on me by my fair 
 my thoughts like hounds pursue me to my death 
 those that i fostered of mine own accord 
 are made by her to murder thus their lord 

whenas my licia sail è d in the seas 
 viewing with pride god neptune 's stately crown 
 a calm she made , and brought the merchant ease 
 the storm she stayed , and checked him with a frown 
 love at the stern sate smiling and did sing 
 to see how seas had learned for to obey 
 and balls of fire into the waves did fling 
 and still the boy full wanton thus did say 
 “ both poles we burnt whereon the world doth turn 
 the round of heaven from earth unto the skies 
 and now the seas we both intend to burn 
 i with my bow , and licia with her eyes 
 then since thy force , heavens , earth , nor seas can move 
 i conquered yield , and do confess i love 

if thou hadst built some mighty instrument 
 and set thee down to utter ordered sound 
 whose faithful billows , from thy hands unbound 
 breaking in light , against our spirits went 
 and caught , and bore above this earthly tent 
 the far strayed back to their prime natal ground 
 where all roots fast in harmony are found 
 and god sits thinking out a pure consent 
 nay , that thou couldst not ; that was not for thee 
 our broken music thou must first restore 
 a harder task than think thine own out free 
 and till thou hast done it , no divinest score 
 though rendered by thine own angelic choir 
 can lift one human spirit from the mire 

beloved , in the noisy city here 
 the thought of thee can make all turmoil cease 
 around my spirit , folds thy spirit clear 
 its still , soft arms , and circles it with peace 
 there is no room for any doubt or fear 
 in souls so overfilled with love 's increase 
 there is no memory of the bygone year 
 but growth in heart 's and spirit 's perfect ease 
 how hath our love , half nebulous at first 
 rounded itself into a full orbed sun 
 how have our lives and wills ( as haply erst 
 they were , ere this forgetfulness begun 
 through all their earthly distances outburst 
 and melted , like two rays of light in one 

the sea shall praise him and the shores bear part 
 that reared him when the bright south world was black 
 with fume of creeds more foul than hell 's own rack 
 still darkening more love 's face with loveless art 
 since paul , faith 's fervent antichrist , of heart 
 heroic , haled the world vehemently back 
 from christ 's pure path on dire jehovah 's track 
 and said to dark elisha 's lord , ‘ thou art 
 but one whose soul had put the raiment on 
 of love that jesus left with james and john 
 withstood that lord whose seals of love were lies 
 seeing what we see — how , touched by truth 's bright rod 
 the fiend whom jews and africans called god 
 feels his own hell take hold on him , and dies 

turgis , count of tortosa came 
 lord of the city , he bears its name 
 scathe to the christian to him is best 
 and in marsil 's presence he joined the rest 
 to the king he said , “ be fearless found 
 peter of rome cannot mate mahound

 no power shall roland from slaughter save

wrongs , injuries , from many a darksome den 
 now , gay in hope , explore the paths of men 
 see from his cavern grim oppression rise 
 and throw on poverty his cruel eyes 
 keen on the helpless victim see him fly 
 and stifle , dark , the feebly bursting cry 
 mark ruffian violence , distained with crimes 
 rousing elate in these degenerate times 
 view unsuspecting innocence a prey 
 as guileful fraud points out the erring way 
 while subtle litigation 's pliant tongue 
 the life blood equal sucks of right and wrong 
 hark , injur 'd want recounts th ’ unlisten 'd tale 
 and much wrong 'd mis'ry pours the unpitied wail 

i learnt to write to you in happier days 
 and every letter was a piece i chipped 
 from off my heart , a fragment newly clipped 
 from the mosaic of life ; its blues and grays 
 its throbbing reds , i gave to earn your praise 
 to make a pavement for your feet i stripped 
 my soul for you to walk upon , and slipped 
 beneath your steps to soften all your ways 
 but now my letters are like blossoms pale 
 we strew upon a grave with hopeless tears 
 i ask no recompense , i shall not fail 
 although you do not heed ; the long , sad years 
 still pass , and still i scatter flowers frail 
 and whisper words of love which no one hears 

the glorious image of the makers beautie 
 my soverayne saynt , the idoll of my thought 
 dare not henceforth , above the bounds of dewtie 
 t'accuse of pride , or rashly blame for ought 
 for being , as she is , divinely wrought 
 and of the brood of angels heavenly born 
 and with the crew of blessed saynts upbrought 
 each of which did her with theyr guifts adorne 
 the bud of ioy , the blossome of the morne 
 the beame of light , whom mortal eyes admyre 
 what reason is it then but she should scorne 
 base things , that to her love too bold aspire 
 such heavenly formes ought rather worshipt be 
 then dare be lov 'd by men of meane degree 

meantime the trojan sends his troops ashore 
 some are by boats expos 'd , by bridges more 
 with lab'ring oars they bear along the strand 
 where the tide languishes , and leap aland 
 tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes 
 and , where no ford he finds , no water fries 
 nor billows with unequal murmurs roar 
 but smoothly slide along , and swell the shore 
 that course he steer 'd , and thus he gave command 
 “ here ply your oars , and at all hazard land 
 force on the vessel , that her keel may wound 
 this hated soil , and furrow hostile ground 
 let me securely land i ask no more 
 then sink my ships , or shatter on the shore 

to whom the cloud compeller , answ'ring , thus 
 “ the purpose , neptune , well thou know'st thyself 
 for which i call 'd ye ; true , they needs must die 
 but still they claim my care ; yet here will i 
 upon olympus ’ lofty ridge remain 
 and view , serene , the combat ; you , the rest 
 go , as you list , to trojans or to greeks 
 and at your pleasure either party aid 
 for if we leave achilles thus alone 
 to fight against the trojans , not an hour 
 will they before the son of peleus stand 
 they dreaded him before ; but now , i fear 
 since rous 'd to fury by his comrade 's death 
 he e'en in fate 's despite may storm the wall 

oh ! might these sighs and tears return again 
 into my breast and eyes which i have spent 
 that i might , in this holy discontent 
 mourn with some fruit , as i have mourned in vain 
 in mine idolatry what showers of rain 
 mine eyes did waste ! what griefs my heart did rent 
 that sufferance was my sin i now repent 
 ‘ cause i did suffer , i must suffer pain 
 the hydroptic drunkard , and night scouting thief 
 the itchy lecher , and self tickling proud 
 have th ’ remembrance of past joys for relief 
 of coming ills . to poor me is allow 'd 
 no ease ; for long yet vehement grief hath been 
 the effect and cause , the punishment and sin 

woe to mine eyes , the organs of mine ill 
 hate to my heart , for not concealing joy 
 a double curse upon my tongue be still 
 whose babbling lost what else i might enjoy 
 when first mine eyes did with thy beauty joy 
 they to my heart thy wondrous virtues told 
 who , fearing lest thy beams should him destroy 
 whate'er he knew , did to my tongue unfold 
 my tell tale tongue , in talking over bold 
 what they in private council did declare 
 to thee , in plain and public terms unrolled 
 and so by that made thee more coyer far 
 what in thy praise he spoke , that didst thou trust 
 and yet my sorrows thou dost hold unjust 

flowers i would bring if flowers could make thee fairer 
 and music , if the muse were dear to thee 
 ( for loving these would make thee love the bearer 
 but sweetest songs forget their melody 
 and loveliest flowers would but conceal the wearer 
 a rose i marked , and might have plucked ; but she 
 blushed as she bent , imploring me to spare her 
 nor spoil her beauty by such rivalry 
 alas ! and with what gifts shall i pursue thee 
 what offerings bring , what treasures lay before thee 
 when earth with all her floral train doth woo thee 
 and all old poets and old songs adore thee 
 and love to thee is naught ; from passionate mood 
 secured by joy 's complacent plenitude 

at the round earth 's imagined corners blow 
 your trumpets , angels ! and arise , arise 
 from death , you numberless infinities 
 of souls , and to your scattered bodies go 
 all whom the flood did , and fire shall , overthrow 
 all whom war , death , age , ague 's tyrannies 
 despair , law , chance , hath slain ; and you whose eyes 
 shall behold god , and never taste death 's woe 
 but let them sleep , lord ! and me mourn a space 
 for if above all these my sins abound 
 ‘ tis late to ask abundance of thy grace 
 when we are there . here on this holy ground 
 teach me how to repent , for that 's as good 
 as if thou hadst sealed my pardon with thy blood 

their course had hardly run three other days 
 when fair aminta , studious still of ways 
 to have her wish , again to alice came 
 to give dear cleon notice of her flame 
 my home , cried she , ‘ tis requisite i leave 
 to ruin me , your cousin , i perceive 
 is still resolved , for presents now he sends 
 but he mistakes , and blindly wealth expends 
 i 'm clearly not the woman he suspects 
 see here , what jewels rare to please the sex 
 nice rubies , diamonds too , but what is more 
 my portrait i have found among the store 
 which must have been from memory designed 
 since only with my husband that you 'll find 

oh , solitude ! thou wonder working fay 
 come nurse my feeble fancy in your arms 
 though i , and thee , and fancy town pent lay 
 come , call around , a world of country charms 
 let all this room , these walls dissolve away 
 and bring me surrey 's fields to take their place 
 this floor be grass , and draughts as breezes play 
 yon curtains trees , to wave in summer 's face 
 my ceiling , sky ; my water jug a stream 
 my bed , a bank , on which to muse and dream 
 the spell is wrought : imagination swells 
 my sleeping room to hills , and woods , and dells 
 i walk abroad , for naught my footsteps hinder 
 and fling my arms . oh ! mi ! i 've broke the winder 

now in sweet tones the inquiring muse express 'd 
 her ardent wish ; and thus the fair address 'd 
 “ priestess of nature ! whose exploring sight 
 pierces the realms of chaos and of night 
 of space unmeasured marks the first and last 
 of endless time the present , future , past 
 immortal guide ! o , now with accents kind 
 give to my ear the progress of the mind 
 how loves , and tastes , and sympathies commence 
 from evanescent notices of sense 
 how from the yielding touch and rolling eyes 
 the piles immense of human science rise 
 with mind gigantic steps the puny elf 
 and weighs and measures all things but himself 

but thus it is . two songs have men and maidens 
 one is for hey day , one is sorrow 's cadence 
 our voices vary with the changing seasons 
 of life 's long year , for deep and natural reasons 
 therefore despair not . think not you have altered 
 if , at some time , the gayer note has faltered 
 we are as god has made us . gladness , pain 
 delight and death , and moods of bliss or bane 
 with love and hate , or good and evil — all 
 at separate times , in separate accents call 
 yet ‘ t is the same heart throb within the breast 
 that gives an impulse to our worst and best 
 i doubt not when our earthly cries are ended 
 the listener finds them in one music blended 

‘ agreed ! ’ cried north ; thought he , this fall 
 with wheat and rye i 'll sow it all 
 in that way i shall get the start 
 and south may whistle for his part 
 so thought , so done , the field was sown 
 and , winter haying come and gone 
 sly north walked blithely forth to spy 
 the progress of his wheat and rye 
 heavens , what a sight ! his brother 's swine 
 had asked themselves all out to dine 
 such grunting , munching , rooting , shoving 
 the soil seemed all alive and moving 
 as for his grain , such work they 'd made on ‘ t 
 he could n't spy a single blade on ‘ t 

give me a golden pen , and let me lean 
 on heap 'd up flowers , in regions clear , and far 
 bring me a tablet whiter than a star 
 or hand of hymning angel , when ‘ tis seen 
 the silver strings of heavenly harp atween 
 and let there glide by many a pearly car 
 pink robes , and wavy hair , and diamond jar 
 and half discovered wings , and glances keen 
 the while let music wander round my ears 
 and as it reaches each delicious ending 
 let me write down a line of glorious tone 
 and full of many wonders of the spheres 
 for what a height my spirit is contending 
 ‘ tis not content so soon to be alone 

on the green bank i sat , and listen 'd long 
 ( sitting was more convenient for the song 
 nor till her lay was ended could i move 
 but wish 'd to dwell for ever in the grove 
 only methought the time too swiftly pass 'd 
 and every note i fear 'd would be the last 
 my sight and smell , and hearing were employ 'd 
 and all three senses in full gust enjoy 'd 
 and what alone did all the rest surpass 
 the sweet possession of the fairy place 
 single , and conscious to myself alone 
 of pleasures to the excluded world unknown 
 pleasures which nowhere else were to be found 
 and all elysium in a spot of ground 

these sorrowing sighs , the smoke of mine annoy 
 these tears , which heat of sacred flame distils 
 are those due tributes that my faith doth pay 
 unto the tyrant whose unkindness kills 
 i sacrifice my youth and blooming years 
 at her proud feet , and she respects not it 
 my flower , untimely 's withered with my tears 
 by winter woes for spring of youth unfit 
 she thinks a look may recompense my care 
 and so with looks prolongs my long looked ease 
 as short that bliss , so is the comfort rare 
 yet must that bliss my hungry thoughts appease 
 thus she returns my hopes so fruitless ever 
 once let her love indeed , or eye me never 

loudly we shouted , and living and dying 
 bore them all backward with strength and strong crying 
 and caleb struck zedek hard at the throat 
 and japhia of lachish zebulon smote 
 the war swords and axes were clashing and groaning 
 the fallen were fighting and foaming and moaning 
 the war spears were breaking , the war horns were braying 
 ere the hands of the slayers were sated with slaying 
 and deep in the grasses grown gory and sodden 
 the treaders of all men were trampled and trodden 
 and over them , routed and reeled like cattle 
 high over the turn of the tide of the battle 
 high over noises that deafen and cover us 
 rang the deliverer 's voice out over us 

and so they buried lincoln ? strange and vain 
 has any creature thought of lincoln hid 
 in any vault ‘ neath any coffin lid 
 in all the years since that wild spring of pain 
 ‘ tis false — he never in the grave hath lain 
 you could not bury him although you slid 
 upon his clay the cheops pyramid 
 or heaped it with the rocky mountain chain 
 they slew themselves ;— they but set lincoln free 
 in all the earth his great heart beats as strong 
 shall beat while pulses throb to chivalry 
 and burn with hate of tyranny and wrong 
 whoever will may find him , anywhere 
 save in the tomb . not there — he is not there 

sweet soul , which , in the april of thy years 
 for to enrich the heaven mad'st poor this round 
 and now , with flaming rays of glory crown 'd 
 most blest abides above the sphere of spheres 
 if heavenly laws , alas ! have not thee bound 
 from looking to this globe that all upbears 
 if ruth and pity there above be found 
 oh , deign to lend a look unto these tears 
 do not disdain , dear ghost , this sacrifice 
 and though i raise not pillars to thy praise 
 my offerings take , let this for me suffice 
 my heart a living pyramid i raise 
 and whilst kings ’ tombs with laurels flourish green 
 thine shall with myrtles and these flowers be seen 

these wonders strange be sees , and many more 
 whose head is pregnant with poetic lore 
 should he upon an evening ramble fare 
 with forehead to the soothing breezes bare 
 would he naught see but the dark , silent blue 
 with all its diamonds trembling through and through 
 or the coy moon , when in the waviness 
 of whitest clouds she does her beauty dress 
 and staidly paces higher up , and higher 
 like a sweet nun in holy day attire 
 ah , yes ! much more would start into his sight 
 the revelries , and mysteries of night 
 and should i ever see them , i will tell you 
 such tales as needs must with amazement spell you 

by no dry death another king goes down 
 the way of kings . yet may no free man 's voice 
 for stern compassion and deep awe , rejoice 
 that one sign more is given against the crown 
 that one more head those dark red waters drown 
 which rise round thrones whose trembling equipoise 
 is propped on sand and bloodshed and such toys 
 as human hearts that shrink at human frown 
 the name writ red on polish earth , the star 
 that was to outshine our england 's in the far 
 east heaven of empire — where is one that saith 
 proud words now , prophesying of this white czar 
 “ in bloodless pangs few kings yield up their breath 
 few tyrants perish by no violent death 

if i should learn , in some quite casual way 
 that you were gone , not to return again 
 read from the back page of a paper , say 
 held by a neighbor in a subway train 
 how at the corner of this avenue 
 and such a street ( so are the papers filled 
 a hurrying man — who happened to be you 
 at noon to day had happened to be killed 
 i should not cry aloud — i could not cry 
 aloud , or wring my hands in such a place 
 i should but watch the station lights rush by 
 with a more careful interest on my face 
 or raise my eyes and read with greater care 
 where to store furs and how to treat the hair 

here , where peralta 's cattle used to stray 
 here , where the spaniards in their early day 
 rode , jingling , booted , spurred , nor ever guessed 
 our race would own the land by them possessed 
 here , where castilian bull fights left their stain 
 of blood upon the soil of this new spain 
 here , where old live oaks , spared till we condemn 
 still wait within this city named for them 
 we celebrate , with bombshell and with rhyme 
 our noisiest day of days of yearly time 
 o bare antonio 's hills that rim our sky 
 antonio 's hills , that used to know july 
 as but a time of sleep beneath the sun 
 such days of languorous dreaming are all done 

when i have fears that i may cease to be 
 before my pen has glean 'd my teeming brain 
 before high piled books , in charactery 
 hold like rich garners the full ripen 'd grain 
 when i behold , upon the night 's starr 'd face 
 huge cloudy symbols of a high romance 
 and think that i may never live to trace 
 their shadows , with the magic hand of chance 
 and when i feel , fair creature of an hour 
 that i shall never look upon thee more 
 never have relish in the faery power 
 of unreflecting love ;— then on the shore 
 of the wide world i stand alone , and think 
 till love and fame to nothingness do sink 

— nor for myself nor any other . yet 
 i cannot but remember all that passed 
 since justice shook these bosoms , and the fret 
 of indignation stirred them and they cast 
 forgot aside all lesser wrongs , and rose 
 against the spiritual evil of that threat 
 that made them of dishonour slaves or foes 
 and who may but with pride remember how 
 not by ten righteous justice might be saved 
 but by unsaintly millions moving all 
 as the tide moves when myriad tossed waves flow 
 one way , and on the crumbling bastions fall 
 then sinking backwards unopposed and slow 
 over the ruined towers where those vain angers raved 

if poisonous minerals , and if that tree 
 whose fruit threw death on ( else immortal ) us 
 if lecherous goats , if serpents envious 
 cannot be damn 'd , alas ! why should i be 
 why should intent or reason , born in me 
 make sins , else equal , in me more heinous 
 and mercy being easy and glorious 
 to god , in his stern wrath why threatens he 
 but who am i that dare dispute with thee 
 o god ! oh , of thine only worthy blood 
 and my tears , make a heavenly lethean flood 
 and drown in it my sins ’ black memory 
 that thou remember them some claim as debt 
 i think it mercy if thou wilt forget 

“ weave the warp , and weave the woof

the squire had wished his trusty man , no doubt 
 had not , at cudgelling , been quite so stout 
 but since he showed himself so true a friend 
 and with his actions could such prudence blend 
 the master fully pardoned what he knew

 no single breath the general stillness stirr 'd 
 their trampling feet alone the warder heard 
 and follow 'd with his sight the dusty cloud

 o'er crackling bushes scud the warrior train 
 and pass with haste the solitary plain 
 ‘ till the broad sun discover 'd from afar 
 the dawning lustre of his golden car

with eager haste descending on the coast

 from sea nursed newport file o'er western roads

 spiritual childhood , thy philosophy 
 so taught'st the a , b , c of heavenly lore 
 because thou sat'st not , lonely evermore 
 with mighty thoughts informing language high 
 but , walking in thy poem continually 
 didst utter acts , of all true forms the core 
 instead of parchment , writing on the soul 
 high thoughts and aspirations , being so 
 thine own ideal ; poet and poem , lo 
 one indivisible ; thou didst reach thy goal 
 triumphant , but with little of acclaim 
 even from thine own , escaping not their blame 

then did a sharped spyre of diamond bright 
 ten feete each way in square , appeare to mee 
 iustly proportion 'd up unto his hight

 made of the mettall which we most do honour

o , years and tides and leagues and all their billows 
 can alter not man 's knowledge of men 's hearts 
 while trees and rocks and clouds include our being 
 we know the epics of atlantis still 
 a hero gave himself to lesser men 
 who first misunderstood and murdered him 
 and then misunderstood and worshipped him 
 a woman was lovely and men fought for her 
 towns burnt for her , and men put men in bondage 
 but she put lengthier bondage on them all

thus graced , thus glorified , shall shakspeare crave 
 the sculptor 's skill , the pageant of the grave

 from some parnassus of the empyreal sky 
 pleased , o'er this dome the gentle spirit bends 
 accepts the gift , and hails us as his friends 
 yet smiles , perchance , to think when envious time 
 o'er bust and urn shall bid his ivies climb 
 when palaces and pyramids shall fall 
 his page shall triumph — still surviving all

the doubt which ye misdeeme , fayre love , is vaine 
 that fondly feare to lose your liberty 
 when , losing one , two liberties ye gayne 
 and make him bond that bondage earst did fly 
 sweet be the bands the which true love doth tye 
 without constraynt or dread of any ill 
 the gentle birde feeles no captivity 
 within her cage , but sings , and feeds her fill 
 there pride dare not approch , nor discord spill 
 the league twixt them that loyal love hath bound 
 but simple truth and mutual good will 
 seeks with sweet peace to salve each others wound 
 there fayth doth fearless dwell in brasen towre 
 and spotlesse pleasure builds her sacred bowre 

so tired am i , so weary of to day 
 so unrefreshed from foregone weariness 
 so overburdened by foreseen distress 
 so lagging and so stumbling on my way 
 i scarce can rouse myself to watch or pray 
 to hope , or aim , or toil for more or less 
 ah , always less and less , even while i press 
 forward and toil and aim as best i may 
 half starved of soul and heartsick utterly 
 yet lift i up my heart and soul and eyes 
 ( which fail in looking upward ) toward the prize

 even me , o lord my lord , remember me 

she starts , with eyes upturn 'd and fleeting breath 
 in their raised axes views her instant death 
 spreads her white hands to heaven in frantic prayer 
 then runs to grasp their knees , and crouches there 
 her hair , half lost along the shrubs she past 
 rolls in loose tangles round her lovely waist 
 her kerchief torn betrays the globes of snow 
 that heave responsive to her weight of woe 
 does all this eloquence suspend the knife 
 does no superior bribe contest her life 
 there does : the scalps by british gold are paid 
 a long hair 'd scalp adorns that heavenly head 
 arid comes the sacred spoil from friend or foe 
 no marks distinguish , and no man can know 

as every animal assists his kind 
 just so are these in blood and business joined 
 yet both in different colours hide their art 
 and each as suits his ends transacts his part 
 one keeps the heart bred villain full in sight 
 the other cants and acts the hypocrite 
 smoothing the deed where law sharks set their gin 
 like a coy dog to draw misfortune in 
 but both will chuckle oer their prisoners ’ sighs 
 and are as blest as spiders over flies 
 such is bumtagg , whose history i resign 
 as other knaves wait room to stink and shine 
 and , as the meanest knave a dog can brag 
 such is the lurcher that assists bumtagg 

o than the fairest day , thrice fairer night 
 night to blest days in which a sun doth rise 
 of which that golden age which clears the skies

 mild creatures , in whose warm crib now lies 
 that heaven sent youngling , holy maid born wight 
 midst , end , beginning of our prophecies 
 blest cottage that hath flowers in winter spread 
 though withered — blessed grass that hath the grace 
 to deck and be a carpet to that place 
 thus sang , unto the sounds , of oaten reed 
 before the babe , the shepherds bowed on knees 
 and springs ran nectar , honey dropped from trees 

an anthem of a sister choristry 
 and like a windward murmur of the sea 
 o'er silver shells , so solemnly it falls 
 a dying music shrouded in deep walls 
 that bury its wild breathings ! and the moon 
 of glow worm hue , like virgin in sad swoon 
 lies coldly on the bosom of a cloud 
 until the elf winds , that are wailing loud 
 do minister unto her sickly trance 
 fanning the life into her countenance 
 and there are pale stars sparkling , far and few 
 in the deep chasms of everlasting blue 
 unmarshall 'd and ungather 'd , one and one 
 like outposts of the lunar garrison 

there valor fronts us with her storied shield 
 brave in devices won on many a field 
 a splendid wreath snatched from the carnage grim 
 is twined around that buckler 's burnished rim 
 and as we gaze , the brazen trumpets blare 
 with shrill vibration shakes the frightened air 
 the roll of musketry — the clash of steel 
 the clang of hoofs as charging squadrons wheel 
 the hoarse command — the imprecative cry 
 swell loud and long , while fancy 's eager eye 
 sees the stern van move on with crimson strides 
 where freedom 's warrior on his war horse rides 
 sees the great cannon flash out red and fast 
 through battle mists which canopy the past 

on silvery beds , of soft asbestus wove 
 meets her gnome husband , and avows her love 
 395 — high o'er her couch impending diamonds blaze 
 and branching gold the crystal roof inlays 
 with verdant light the modest emeralds glow 
 blue sapphires glare , and rubies blush , below 
 light piers of lazuli the dome surround 
 400 and pictured mochoes tesselate the ground 
 in glittering threads along reflective walls 
 the warm rill murmuring twinkles , as it falls 
 now sink the eolian strings , and now they swell 
 and echoes woo in every vaulted cell 
 405 while on white wings delighted cupids play 
 shake their bright lamps , and shed celestial day 

what potions have i drunk of siren tears 
 distilled from limbecks foul as hell within 
 applying fears to hopes , and hopes to fears 
 still losing when i saw my self to win 
 what wretched errors hath my heart committed 
 whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never 
 how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted 
 in the distraction of this madding fever 
 o benefit of ill , now i find true 
 that better is , by evil still made better 
 and ruined love when it is built anew 
 grows fairer than at first , more strong , far greater 
 so i return rebuked to my content 
 and gain by ills thrice more than i have spent

one spring brought me my wedding day 
 brought me my bright eyed jeanne amray 
 brought that night to our cabin door 
 my old , lost comrade , nell latore 
 her eyes swam fire , and her cheek was red 
 her full breast heaved as she darkly said 
 “ the coyote hides from the wind and rain 
 the wild horse flies from the hurricane 
 but who can flee from the half breed 's hate 
 that rises soon and that watches late 
 then went ; and i laughed jeanne 's fears afar

 it works up war like a navy yard 

two loves i have of comfort and despair 
 which like two spirits do suggest me still

 the worser spirit a woman coloured ill 
 to win me soon to hell my female evil 
 tempteth my better angel from my side 
 and would corrupt my saint to be a devil 
 wooing his purity with her foul pride 
 and whether that my angel be turned fiend 
 suspect i may , yet not directly tell 
 but being both from me both to each friend 
 i guess one angel in another 's hell 
 yet this shall i ne'er know but live in doubt

 the grateful muse shall tell the world your fame 
 and unborn realms resound the deathless name 

jehu , on whom i see your hopes are built 
 paying his gifts with thankless thoughtlessness 
 jehu in peace leaves ahab 's hideous daughter 
 following the course profane of israel 's kings 
 of egypt 's worthless god he saves the temples 
 jehu , at length , dares offer on the heights 
 an incense rash which god can not allow 
 his heart 's not just enough , nor pure his hands 
 to serve his cause — to avenge his injuries 
 no , no , ‘ tis god alone we must engage 
 far from concealing , let us show the boy 
 and let the diadem surround his head 
 i even will urge on the expected hour 
 before vile mathan 's complots can be formed

no man can understand the sea , until 
 he knows all passions of the senses ; all 
 the great emotions of the heart ; and each 
 exalted aspiration of the soul 
 then may he sit beside the sea and say 
 ‘ i , too , have flung myself against the rocks 
 and kissed their flinty brows with no return 
 and fallen spent upon unfeeling sands 
 i , too , have gone forth yearning , to far shores 
 seeking that something which would bring content 
 and finding only what i took away 
 and i have looked up , through the veil of skies 
 when all the world was still , and understood 
 that i am one with nature and with god 

there was never a sound beside the wood but one 
 and that was my long scythe whispering to the ground 
 what was it it whispered ? i knew not well myself 
 perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun 
 something , perhaps , about the lack of sound 
 and that was why it whispered and did not speak 
 it was no dream of the gift of idle hours 
 or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf 
 anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak 
 to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows 
 not without feeble pointed spikes of flowers 
 ( pale orchises ) , and scared a bright green snake 
 the fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows 
 my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make 

“ e'en on the day when youth with beauty wed 
 the flames surprized them in their nuptial bed 
 435 seen at the opening sash with bosom bare 
 with wringing hands , and dark dishevel 'd hair 
 the blushing beauty with disorder 'd charms 
 round her fond lover winds her ivory arms 
 beat , as they clasp , their throbbing hearts with fear 
 440 and many a kiss is mix 'd with many a tear 
 ah me ! in vain the labouring engines pour 
 round their pale limbs the ineffectual shower 
 — then crash 'd the floor , while shrinking crouds retire 
 and love and virtue sunk amid the fire 
 445 with piercing screams afflicted strangers mourn 
 and their white ashes mingle in their urn 

oft let me range the gloomy aisles alone 
 sad luxury ! to vulgar minds unknown 
 along the walls where speaking marbles show 
 what worthies form the hallowed mould belew 
 proud names , who once the reins of empire held 
 in arms who triumphed , or in arts excelled 
 chiefs , graced with scars , and prodigal of blood 
 stern patriots , who for sacred freedom stood 
 just men , by whom impartial laws were given 
 and saints , who taught and led the way to heaven 
 ne'er to these chambers , where the mighty rest 
 since their foundation came a nobler guest 
 nor e'er was to the bowers of bliss conveyed 
 a fairer spirit or more welcome shade 

but o thou cruel stepmother and hard 
 to thy poor fenceless , naked child , the bard 
 a thing unteachable in worldly skill 
 and half an idiot too , more helpless still 
 no heels to bear him from the op'ning dun 
 no claws to dig , his hated sight to shun 
 no horns , but those by luckless hymen worn 
 and those , alas ! not amalthea 's horn 
 no nerves olfact'ry , true to mammon 's foot 
 or grunting , grub sagacious , evil 's root 
 the silly sheep that wanders wild astray 
 is not more friendless , is not more a prey 
 vampyre — booksellers drain him to the heart 
 and viper — critics cureless venom dart 

go down to hell . this end is good to see 
 the breath is lightened and the sense at ease 
 because thou art not ; sense nor breath there is 
 in what thy body was , whose soul shall be 
 chief nerve of hell 's pained heart eternally 
 thou art abolished from the midst of these 
 that are what thou wast : pius from his knees 
 blows off the dust that flecked them , bowed for thee 
 yea , now the long tongued slack lipped litanies 
 fail , and the priest has no more prayer to sell 
 now the last jesuit found about thee is 
 the beast that made thy fouler flesh his cell 
 time lays his finger on thee , saying , “ cease 
 here is no room for thee ; go down to hell 

here one is happy if the fickle crowd 
 his name the threefold honor has allowed 
 and there another , if into his stores 
 comes what is swept from libyan threshing floors 
 he who delights to till his father 's lands 
 and grasps the delving hoe with willing hands 
 can never to attalic offers hark 
 or cut the myrtoan sea with cyprian bark 
 the merchant , timorous of afric 's breeze 
 when fiercely struggling with icarian seas 
 praises the restful quiet of his home 
 nor wishes from the peaceful fields to roam 
 ah , speedily his shattered ships he mends 
 to poverty his lesson ne'er extends 

“ such are the men who , with instinctive dread 
 whenever freedom lifts her drooping head 
 make prophet tripods of their office stools 
 and scare the nurseries and the village schools 
 with dire presage of ruin grim and great 
 a broken union and a foundered state 
 such are the patriots , self bound to the stake 
 of office , martyrs for their country 's sake 
 who fill themselves the hungry jaws of fate 
 and by their loss of manhood save the state 
 in the wide gulf themselves like cortius throw 
 and test the virtues of cohesive dough 
 as tropic monkeys , linking heads and tails 
 bridge o'er some torrent of ecuador 's vales 

o lady fair , whose honoured name doth grace 
 green vale and noble ford of rheno 's stream 
 of all worth void the man i surely deem 
 whom thy fair soul enamoureth not apace 
 when softly self revealed to time and space 
 by actions sweet with which thy will doth teem 
 and fair gifts that love 's bow and arrows seem 
 but are the flowers that crown thy perfect race 
 when thou dost lightsome talk or gladsome sing 
 a power to draw the hill trees , rooted hard 
 the doors of eyes and ears let that man keep 
 who knows himself unworthy thy regard 
 grace from above alone him help can bring 
 that passion in his heart strike not too deep 

so spoke the blest immortal ; when more near 
 his northern wilds in all their breadth appear 
 lands yet unknown , and streams without a name 
 rise into vision and demand their fame 
 as when some saint first gains his bright abode 
 vaults o'er the spheres and views the works of god 
 sees earth , his kindred orb , beneath him roll 
 here glow the centre , and there point the pole 
 o'er land and sea his eyes delighted rove 
 and human thoughts his heavenly joys improve 
 with equal scope the raptured hero 's sight 
 ranged the low vale , or climb 'd the cloudy height 
 as , fixt in ardent look , his opening mind 
 explored the realms that here invite mankind 

i served my sentence — a bitter pill 
 some fellows should take who never will 
 and then i decided to go “ out west

and hither does one poet sometimes row 
 his pinnace , a small vagrant barge , up piled 
 with plenteous store of heath and wither 'd fern 
 a lading which he with his sickle cuts 
 among the mountains , and beneath this roof 
 he makes his summer couch , and here at noon 
 spreads out his limbs , while , yet unborn , the sheep 
 panting beneath the burthen of their wool 
 lie round him , even as if they were a part 
 of his own household : nor , while from his bed 
 he through that door place looks toward the lake 
 and to the stirring breezes , does he want 
 creations lovely as the work of sleep 
 fair sights , and visions of romantic joy 

pride of thy race ! before my mental eyes 
 i see thee , like another alfred rise 
 see honour splendent on thy ample brow 
 while thought and genius fill the orbs below 
 those beaming orbs ! where lofty sweetness shone 
 and where the soul sate smiling on her throne 
 depriv 'd too soon of that benignant ray 
 which impious dahab shudder 'd to survey 
 pale , bleeding , conquer 'd , dying , and forlorn 
 i see thee view the wretch with silent scorn 
 see thy cheek flush at the false tears he shed 
 and proudly turn away the languid head 
 with mingled anger , sorrow , and disdain 
 that he should dare to tempt thy love again 

the world was in its day of peril dark 
 wont to believe the dotage of fond love 
 from the fair cyprian deity , who rolls 
 in her third epicycle , shed on men 
 by stream of potent radiance : therefore they 
 of elder time , in their old error blind 
 not her alone with sacrifice ador 'd 
 and invocation , but like honours paid 
 to cupid and dione , deem 'd of them 
 her mother , and her son , him whom they feign 'd 
 to sit in dido 's bosom : and from her 
 whom i have sung preluding , borrow 'd they 
 the appellation of that star , which views 
 now obvious and now averse , the sun 

how many bards gild the lapses of time 
 a few of them have ever been the food 
 of my delighted fancy ,— i could brood 
 over their beauties , earthly , or sublime 
 and often , when i sit me down to rhyme 
 these will in throngs before my mind intrude 
 but no confusion , no disturbance rude 
 do they occasion ; ‘ tis a pleasing chime 
 so the unnumber 'd sounds that evening store 
 the songs of birds — the whisp'ring of the leaves 
 the voice of waters — the great bell that heaves 
 with solemn sound ,— and thousand others more 
 that distance of recognizance bereaves 
 make pleasing music , and not wild uproar 

as the blind man behind his leader walks 
 lest he should err , or stumble unawares 
 on what might harm him , or perhaps destroy 
 i journey 'd through that bitter air and foul 
 still list'ning to my escort 's warning voice 
 “ look that from me thou part not . ” straight i heard 
 voices , and each one seem 'd to pray for peace 
 and for compassion , to the lamb of god 
 that taketh sins away . their prelude still 
 was “ agnus dei , ” and through all the choir 
 one voice , one measure ran , that perfect seem 'd 
 the concord of their song . “ are these i hear 
 spirits , o master ? ” i exclaim 'd ; and he 
 “ thou aim'st aright : these loose the bonds of wrath 

point to the summits where the brave have bled 
 where every village claims its glorious dead 
 say , when their bosoms met the bayonet 's shock 
 their only corselet was the rustic frock 
 say , when they mustered to the gathering horn 
 the titled chieftain curled his lip in scorn 
 yet , when their leader bade his lines advance 
 no musket wavered in the lion 's glance 
 say , when they fainted in the forced retreat 
 they tracked the snow drifts with their bleeding feet 
 yet still their banners , tossing in the blast 
 bore ever ready , faithful to the last 
 through storm and battle , till they waved again 
 on yorktown 's hills and saratoga 's plain 

what hast thou done , o womanhood of france 
 mother and daughter , sister , sweetheart , wife 
 what hast thou done , amid this fateful strife 
 to prove the pride of thine inheritance 
 in this fair land of freedom and romance 
 i hear thy voice with tears and courage rife 
 smiling against the swords that seek thy life 
 make answer in a noble utterance 
 “ i give france all i have , and all she asks 
 would it were more ! ah , let her ask and take 
 my hands to nurse her wounded , do her tasks 
 my feet to run her errands through the dark 
 my heart to bleed in triumph for her sake 
 and all my soul to follow thee , jeanne d'arc 

festivals have i seen that were not names 
 this is young buonaparte 's natal day 
 and his is henceforth an established sway 
 consul for life . with worship france proclaims 
 her approbation , and with pomps and games 
 heaven grant that other cities may be gay 
 calais is not : and i have bent my way 
 to the sea coast , noting that each man frames 
 his business as he likes . another time 
 that was , when i was here long years ago 
 the senselessness of joy was then sublime 
 happy is he , who , caring not for pope 
 consul , or king , can sound himself to know 
 the destiny of man , and live in hope 

“ all selfishness ! ” cried linda ; “ selfishness 
 i seek my happiness , and others theirs 
 only my tastes are different ; more plebeian 
 haply , they 'd say ; but , husband mine , reflect 
 you , too , i fear , are lacking in refinement 
 would this have been , had you not acquiesced 
 in all these vulgar freaks , and found content 
 like me , in giving pleasure to the needy 
 and tell me — passing to another point 
 where would have been the monarch of this joy 
 that little child ,— that antepast of bliss 
 such as the angels taste ,— had i recoiled 
 from daring as i did , even when i knew 
 he i most wished to win would think me bold 

but then , as now — it may be , something more 
 woman and man were human to the core 
 the hearts that throbbed behind that brave attire 
 burned with a plenitude of essential fire 
 they too could risk , they also could rebel 
 they could love wisely — they could love too well 
 in that great duel of sex , that ancient strife 
 which is the very central fact of life 
 they could — and did — engage it breath for breath 
 they could — and did — get wounded unto death 
 as at all times since time for us began 
 woman was truly woman , man was man 
 and joy and sorrow were as much at home 
 in trifling tunbridge as in mighty rome 

the knightly legend on thy shield betrays 
 the moral of thy life ; a forecast wise 
 and that large honor that deceit defies 
 inspired thy fathers in the elder days 
 who decked thy scutcheon with that sturdy phrase 
 to be , rather than seem . as eve 's red skies 
 surpass the morning 's rosy prophecies 
 thy life to that proud boast its answer pays 
 scorning thy faith and purpose to defend 
 the ever mutable multitude at last 
 will hail the power they did not comprehend 
 thy fame will broaden through the centuries 
 as , storm and billowy tumult overpast 
 the moon rules calmly o'er the conquered seas 

as islam 's prophet , when his last day drew 
 nigh to its close , besought all men to say 
 whom he had wronged , to whom he then should pay 
 a debt forgotten , or for pardon sue 
 and , through the silence of his weeping friends 
 a strange voice cried : “ thou owest me a debt 
 “ allah be praised ! ” he answered . “ even yet 
 he gives me power to make to thee amends 
 o friend ! i thank thee for thy timely word 
 so runs the tale . its lesson all may heed 
 for all have sinned in thought , or word , or deed 
 or , like the prophet , through neglect have erred 
 all need forgiveness , all have debts to pay 
 ere the night cometh , while it still is day 

led by the dark dominicans of spain 
 a newborn fury walks the wide domain 
 gaunt inquisition ; mark her giant stride 
 her blood nursed vulture screaming at her side 
 her priestly train the tools of torment brings 
 racks , wheels and crosses , faggots , stakes and strings 
 scaffolds and cages round her altar stand 
 and , tipt with sulphur , waves her flaming brand 
 her imps of inquest round the fiend advance 
 suspectors grave , and spies with eye askance 
 pretended heretics who worm the soul 
 and sly confessors with their secret scroll 
 accusers hired , for each conviction paid 
 judges retain 'd and witnesses by trade 

mine eyes are filled today with old amaze 
 at mountains , and at meadows deftly strewn 
 with bits of the gay jewelry of june 
 and of her splendid vesture ; and , agaze 
 i stand where spring her bright brocade of days 
 embroidered o'er , and listen to the flow 
 of sudden runlets — the faint blasts they blow 
 low , on their stony bugles , in still ways 
 for wonders are at one , confederate yet 
 yea , where the wearied year came to a close 
 an odor reminiscent of the rose 
 and everywhere her seal has summer set 
 and , as of old , in the horizon sky 
 the sun can find a lovely place to die 

victorious through failure ! faithful lord 
 who for twelve angel legions wouldst not pray 
 from thine own country of eternal day 
 to shield thee from the lanterned traitor horde 
 making thy one rash servant sheathe his sword 
 our long retarded legions , on their way 
 toiling through sands , and shouldering nile 's down sway 
 to reach thy soldier , keeping at thy word 
 thou sawest foiled — but glorifiedst him 
 over ten cities giving him thy rule 
 we will not mourn a star that grew not dim 
 a soldier child of god gone home from school 
 a dregless cup , with life brimmed , he did quaff 
 and quaffs it now with christ 's imperial staff 

strong time and fire swift change , with lightnings clad 
 and shod with thunders of reverberate years 
 have filled with light and sound of hopes and fears 
 the space of many a season , since i had 
 grace of good hap to make my spirit glad 
 once communing with thine : and memory hears 
 the bright voice yet that then rejoiced mine ears 
 sees yet the light of eyes that spake , and bade 
 fear not , but hope , though then time 's heart were weak 
 and heaven by hell shade stricken , and the range 
 of high born hope made questionable and strange 
 as twilight trembling till the sunlight speak 
 thou sawest the sunrise and the storm in one 
 break : seest thou now the storm compelling sun 

lo , i awhile the story of the saint 
 the song of praise of him who did the deeds 
 have set forth here in words , a tale well known 
 beyond my power ; much is there yet to tell 
 a weary task — what he in life endured 
 from the beginning on ! a wiser man 
 upon the earth than i account myself 
 must in his heart invent it , one who knows 
 from the beginning all the misery 
 which bravely he endured in cruel wars 
 yet in small parts we further must relate 
 a portion of that tale . it has been told 
 already how he suffered many woes 
 from grievous warfare in the heathen town 

not that thy hand is soft , is sweet , is white 
 thy lips sweet roses , breast sweet lily is 
 that love esteems these three the chiefest bliss 
 which nature ever made for lips ’ delight 
 but when these three to show their heavenly might 
 such wonders do , devotion then for this 
 commandeth us with humble zeal to kiss 
 such things as work miracles in our sight 
 a lute of senseless wood , by nature dumb 
 touched by thy hand doth speak divinely well 
 and from thy lips and breast sweet tunes do come 
 to my dead heart , the which new life do give 
 of greater wonders heard we never tell 
 than for the dumb to speak , the dead to live 

the virtuous delegates behold with pain 
 the hostile britons hovering o'er the main

 and blot their annals with fraternal rage

 by language , laws and liberty combined 
 great nurse of thought , example to mankind 
 columbia rears her warning voice in vain 
 brothers to brothers call across the main 
 britannia 's patriots lend a listening ear 
 but kings and courtiers push their mad career 
 dissension raves , the sheathless falchions glare 
 and earth and ocean tremble at the war 

hard are the rocks , the marble , and the steel 
 the ancient oak with wind and weather tossed 
 but you , my love , far harder do i feel 
 than flint , or these , or is the winter 's frost

 my sighs , that rock , like wind it cannot rent 
 too tiger like you swear you cannot love 
 but tears and sighs you fruitless back have sent 
 the frost too hard , not melted with my flame 
 i cinders am , and yet you feel no heat 
 surpass not these , sweet love , for very shame 
 but let my tears , my vows , my sighs entreat 
 then shall i say as by trial find 
 these all are hard , but you , my love , are kind 

trained in the holy art whose lifted shield 
 wards off the darts a never slumbering foe 
 by hearth and wayside lurking , waits to throw

 the slayer 's weapon : on the murderous field 
 the fiery bolt he challenged laid him low 
 seeking its noblest victim . even so 
 the charter of a nation must be sealed 
 the healer 's brow the hero 's honors crowned 
 from lowliest duty called to loftiest deed

 where freedom 's victory in defeat was found 

gone are the sensuous stars , and manifold 
 clear sunbeams burst upon the front of night 
 ten thousand swords of azure and of gold

 an old man writing in a book of dreams 
 and telling tales of lovers for the years 
 still troilus hears a voice that whispers , stay 
 in nature 's garden what a mad rout sings 
 let 's hear these motley pilgrims wile away 
 the tedious hours with stories of old things 
 or might some shining eagle claim 
 these lowly numbers for the house of fame

 and pray to him in secret : he will hear 
 but think not thou , by one wild bound , to clear 
 the numberless ascensions , more and more

 will strew my path with mortal flowers of song 

thank god , he saw you last in pomp of may 
 ere any leaf had felt the year 's regret 
 your latest image in his memory set 
 was fair as when your landscape 's peaceful sway 
 charmed dearer eyes with his to make delay 
 on hope 's long prospect ,— as if they forget 
 the happy , they , the unspeakable three , whose debt 
 like the hawk 's shadow , blots our brightest day 
 better it is that ye should look so fair 
 slopes that he loved , and ever murmuring pines 
 that make a music out of silent air 
 and bloom heaped orchard trees in prosperous lines 
 in you the heart some sweeter hints divines 
 and wiser , than in winter 's dull despair 

of all the kings that ever here did reign 
 edward named fourth as first in praise i name 
 not for his fair outside , nor well lined brain 
 although less gifts imp feathers oft on fame 
 nor that he could , young wise , wise valiant , frame 
 his sire 's revenge , join 'd with a kingdom 's gain 
 and , gain 'd by mars , could yet mad mars so tame 
 that balance weigh 'd what sword did late obtain 
 nor that he made the flower de luce so ‘ fraid 
 though strongly hedged of bloody lion 's paws 
 that witty lewis to him a tribute paid 
 nor this , nor that , nor any such small cause 
 but only for this worthy knight durst prove 
 to lose his crown , rather than fail his love 

o , i implore , ye gods ! who did attend

 ye native deities of latium 's soil 
 quirinus , founder of the walls of rome 
 mars , of quirinus never conquer 'd , sire 
 vesta , held sacred midst the c æ sars ’ gods 
 domestic ph œ bus , with chaste vesta plac 'd 
 and jove , who guards the high tarpei ä n walls 
 with all whom pious poets may invoke 
 slow may that day arrive , and older far 
 than what our age may see , when to the clouds 
 his glorious head shall mount , quitting this globe 
 he rules so well , and our beseeching prayers 
 bending with condescending ear to grant 

who is it that says most , which can say more 
 than this rich praise , that you alone , are you 
 in whose confine immured is the store 
 which should example where your equal grew 
 lean penury within that pen doth dwell 
 that to his subject lends not some small glory 
 but he that writes of you , if he can tell 
 that you are you , so dignifies his story 
 let him but copy what in you is writ 
 not making worse what nature made so clear 
 and such a counterpart shall fame his wit 
 making his style admired every where 
 you to your beauteous blessings add a curse 
 being fond on praise , which makes your praises worse 

so long your reign , said richard , o'er my mind 
 deny i could not , howsoe'er inclined 
 with mrs. simon often is your spouse 
 her character no doubt your spleen will rouse 
 i 've no design , observe to give offence 
 but , when i see your int'rest in suspense 
 i cannot silent keep ; though , were i still 
 a slave , devoted wholly to your will 
 as late i moved , i would not drop a word 
 mistrust of lovers may not be absurd 
 besides , you 'd fancy other motives led 
 to tell you of your husband what was said 
 but heav'n be praised , of you i nothing want 
 my object 's plain — no more the fond gallant 

in hs ü   chou , in the district of ku f ē ng 
 there lies a village whose name is chu ch ‘ē n 
 a hundred miles away from the county town 
 amid fields of hemp and green of mulberry trees 
 click , click goes the sound of the spinning wheel 
 mules and oxen pack the village streets 
 the girls go drawing the water from the brook 
 the men go gathering fire wood on the hill 
 so far from the town government affairs are few 
 so deep in the hills , man ’ s ways are simple 
 though they have wealth , they do not traffic with it 
 though they reach the age , they do not enter the army 
 each family keeps to its village trade 
 grey headed , they have never left the gates 

i cannot tell what change hath come to you 
 to vex your splendid hair . i only know 
 one grief . the passion left betwixt us two 
 like some forsaken watchfire , burneth low 
 ‘ tis sad to turn and find it dying so 
 without a hope of resurrection ! yet 
 o radiant face that found me tired and lone 
 i shall not for the dear , dead past forget 
 the sweetest looks of all the summers gone 
 ah ! time hath made familiar wild regret 
 for now the leaves are white in last year 's bowers 
 and now doth sob along the ruined leas 
 the homeless storm from saddened southern seas 
 while march sits weeping over withered flowers 

love , though for this you riddle me with darts 
 and drag me at your chariot till i die 
 oh , heavy prince ! oh , panderer of hearts 
 yet hear me tell how in their throats they lie 
 who shout you mighty : thick about my hair 
 day in , day out , your ominous arrows purr 
 who still am free , unto no querulous care 
 a fool , and in no temple worshiper 
 i , that have bared me to your quiver 's fire 
 lifted my face into its puny rain 
 do wreathe you impotent to evoke desire 
 as you are powerless to elicit pain 
 ( now will the god , for blasphemy so brave 
 punish me , surely , with the shaft i crave 

when poets would be lofty , they commence 
 with some gay patch of cheap magnificence 
 of dian 's altar and her grove we read 
 or rapid streams meandering through the mead 
 or grand descriptions of the river rhine 
 or watery bow , will take up many a line 
 all in their way good things , but not just now 
 you 're happy at a cypress , we 'll allow 
 but what of that ? you 're painting by command 
 a shipwrecked sailor , striking out for land 
 that crockery was a jar when you began 
 it ends a pitcher : you an artist , man 
 make what you will , in short , so , when ‘ tis done 
 ‘ tis but consistent , homogeneous , one 

not mine own fears , nor the prophetic soul 
 of the wide world , dreaming on things to come 
 can yet the lease of my true love control 
 supposed as forfeit to a confined doom 
 the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured 
 and the sad augurs mock their own presage 
 incertainties now crown themselves assured 
 and peace proclaims olives of endless age 
 now with the drops of this most balmy time 
 my love looks fresh , and death to me subscribes 
 since spite of him i 'll live in this poor rhyme 
 while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes 
 and thou in this shalt find thy monument 
 when tyrants ’ crests and tombs of brass are spent 

the other maidens raised their eyes to him 
 who stumbled in before them when the fight 
 had left him victor , with a victor 's right 
 i think his eyes with quick hot tears grew dim 
 he scarcely saw her swaying white and slim 
 and trembling slightly , dreaming of his might 
 nor knew he touched her hand , as strangely light 
 as a wan wraith 's beside a river 's rim 
 the other maidens raised their eyes to see 
 and only she has hid her face away 
 and yet i ween she loved him more than they 
 and very fairly fashioned was her face 
 yet for love 's shame and sweet humility 
 she dared not meet him with their queenlike grace 

as an old mercer in some sleepy town 
 swings wide his windows new day after day 
 sets all his wares around in arch array 
 to please the taste of passers up and down 
 his hoard of handy things of trite renown 
 of sweets and spices and of faint perfumes 
 of silks and prints ,— and at the last illumes 
 his tiny panes to foil the evening 's frown 
 so nature spreads her proffered treasures : such 
 as daily dazzle at the morning 's rise 
 fair show of isle and ocean merchandise 
 and airy offerings filmy to the touch 
 then , lest we like not these , in dark 's bazaars 
 she nightly tempts us with her store of stars 

i dreamed we walked together , you and i 
 along a white and lonely road , that went 
 i know not where . . . and we were well content 
 our laughter was untroubled as the sky 
 and all our talk was delicate and shy 
 though in that cage of words wild thoughts were pent 
 like prisoned birds that some sweet accident 
 might yet release to sing again , and fly 
 we passed between long lines of poplar trees 
 where , summer comrades gay and debonair 
 the south wind and the sunlight danced . . . you smiled 
 with great glad eyes , as bright as summer seas 
 to feel their twinkling fingers in your hair 
 and then you kissed me , quickly , like a child 

light of our fathers ’ eyes , and in our own 
 star of the unsetting sunset ! for thy name 
 that on the front of noon was as a flame 
 in the great year nigh thirty years agone 
 when all the heavens of europe shook and shone 
 with stormy wind and lightning , keeps its fame 
 and bears its witness all day through the same 
 not for past days and great deeds past alone 
 kossuth , we praise thee as our landor praised 
 but that now too we know thy voice upraised 
 thy voice , the trumpet of the truth of god 
 thine hand , the thunder bearer 's , raised to smite 
 as with heaven 's lightning for a sword and rod 
 men 's heads abased before the muscovite 

they that have power to hurt , and will do none 
 that do not do the thing , they most do show 
 who moving others , are themselves as stone 
 unmoved , cold , and to temptation slow 
 they rightly do inherit heaven 's graces 
 and husband nature 's riches from expense 
 tibey are the lords and owners of their faces 
 others , but stewards of their excellence 
 the summer 's flower is to the summer sweet 
 though to it self , it only live and die 
 but if that flower with base infection meet 
 the basest weed outbraves his dignity 
 for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds 
 lilies that fester , smell far worse than weeds 

the love which me so cruelly tormenteth 
 so pleasing is in my extreamest paine 
 that , all the more my sorrow it augmenteth 
 the more i love and doe embrace my bane 
 ne do i wish ( for wishing were but vaine 
 to be acquit fro my continual smart 
 but ioy her thrall for ever to remayne 
 and yield for pledge my poor and captyved hart 
 the which , that it from her may never start 
 let her , yf please her , bynd with adamant chayne 
 and from all wandring loves , which mote pervart 
 his safe assurance , strongly it restrayne 
 onely let her abstaine from cruelty 
 and doe me not before my time to dy 

ah ! why hath nature to so hard a hart 
 given so goodly giftes of beauties grace 
 whose pryde depraves each other better part 
 and all those pretious ornaments deface 
 sith to all other beastes of bloody race 
 a dreadfull countenance she given hath 
 that with theyr terrour all the rest may chace 
 and warne to shun the daunger of theyr wrath 
 but my proud one doth worke the greater scath 
 through sweet allurement of her lovely hew 
 that she the better may in bloody bath 
 of such poore thralls her cruell hands embrew 
 but did she know how ill these two accord 
 such cruelty she would have soone abhord 

to yon dim rounds first elevate thy view 
 see quito 's plains o'erlook their proud peru 
 on whose huge base , like isles amid sky driven 
 a vast protuberance props the cope of heaven 
 earth 's loftiest turrets there contend for height 
 and all our andes fill the bounded sight 
 from south to north what long blue swells arise 
 built thro the clouds , and lost in ambient skies 
 approaching slow they heave expanding bounds 
 the yielding concave bends sublimer rounds 
 whose wearied stars , high curving to the west 
 pause on the summits for a moment 's rest 
 recumbent there they renovate their force 
 and roll rejoicing on their downward course 

‘ tis a cruel creed , believe it not 
 death to the good is a milder lot 
 they are here ,— they are here ,— that harmless pair 
 in the yellow sunshine and flowing air 
 in the light cloud shadows that slowly pass 
 in the sounds that rise from the murmuring grass 
 they sit where their humble cottage stood 
 they walk by the waving edge of the wood 
 and list to the long accustomed flow 
 of the brook that wets the rocks below 
 patient , and peaceful , and passionless 
 as seasons on seasons swiftly press 
 they watch , and wait , and linger around 
 till the day when their bodies shall leave the ground 

dear cymru , mid thy mountains soaring high 
 dwells genius , basking on thy quiet air 
 and heavenly shades , and solitude more rare 
 and all wrapt round with fullest harmony 
 of streams which fall afar . thus pleasantly 
 ‘ neath nature their fit foster mother 's care 
 thy children learn from infant hours to bear 
 and work the will of god . thy scenery 
 so varied wild , so strangely sweet and strong 
 works on them and to music moulds their mind 
 till flows their fancy in poetic rills 
 the voice of nature breathes in every song 
 and we may read therein thy features kind 
 as in some tarn that nestles ‘ neath thy hills 

love with her hair my love by force hath tied 
 to serve her lips , her eyes , her voice , her hand 
 i smiled for joy , when i the boy espied 
 to lie unchained and live at her command 
 she if she look , or kiss , or sing , or smile 
 cupid withal doth smile , doth sing , doth kiss 
 lips , hands , voice , eyes , all hearts that may beguile 
 because she scorns all hearts but only this 
 venus for this in pride began to frown 
 that cupid , born a god , enthralled should be 
 she in disdain her pretty son threw down 
 and in his place , with love she chain è d me 
 so now , sweet love , though i myself be thrall 
 not her a goddess , but thyself i call 

as in the twilight brown , on hillside bare 
 useth to go the little shepherd maid 
 watering some strange fair plant , poorly displayed 
 ill thriving in unwonted soil and air 
 far from its native springtime 's genial care 
 so on my ready tongue hath love assayed 
 in a strange speech to wake new flower and blade 
 while i of thee , proud yet so debonair 
 sing songs whose sense is to my people lost 
 yield the fair thames , and the fair arno gain 
 love willed it so , and i , at others ’ cost 
 already knew love never willed in vain 
 would my heart slow and bosom hard were found 
 to him who plants from heaven so fair a ground 

meanwhile the arts , in second infancy 
 rise in some distant clime , and then , perchance 
 some bold adventurer , fill 'd with golden dreams 
 steering his bark through trackless solitudes 
 where , to his wandering thoughts , no daring prow 
 hath ever ploughed before ,— espies the cliffs 
 of fallen albion .— to the land unknown 
 he journeys joyful ; and perhaps descries 
 some vestige of her ancient stateliness 
 then he , with vain conjecture , fills his mind 
 of the unheard of race , which had arrived 
 at science in that solitary nook 
 far from the civil world ; and sagely sighs 
 and moralizes on the state of man 

be nought dismayd that her unmoved mind 
 doth still persist in her rebellious pride 
 such love , not lyke to lusts of baser kynd 
 the harder wonne , the firmer will abide 
 the durefull oake whose sap is not yet dride 
 is long ere it conceive the kindling fyre 
 but when it once doth burne , it doth divide 
 great heat , and makes his flames to heaven aspire 
 so hard it is to kindle new desire 
 in gentle brest , that shall endure for ever 
 deepe is the wound that dints the parts entire 
 with chaste affects , that naught but death can sever 
 then thinke not long in taking litle paine 
 to knit the knot that ever shall remaine 

like as whilome the children of the earth 
 heapt hils on hils to scale the starrie skie 
 and fight against the gods of heavenly berth 
 whiles iove at them his thunderbolts let flie 
 all suddenly with lightning overthrowne 
 the furious squadrons downe to ground did fall 
 that th'earth under her childrens weight did grone 
 and th'heavens in glorie triumpht over all 
 so did that haughtie front , which heaped was 
 on these seven romane hils , it selfe upreare 
 over the world , and lift her loftie face 
 against the heaven , that gan her force to feare 
 but now these scorned fields bemone her fall 
 and gods secure feare not her force at all 

with all our hearts we praise you whom ye hate 
 high souls that hate us ; for our hopes are higher 
 and higher than yours the goal of our desire 
 though high your ends be as your hearts are great 
 your world of gods and kings , of shrine and state 
 was of the night when hope and fear stood nigher 
 wherein men walked by light of stars and fire 
 till man by day stood equal with his fate 
 honour not hate we give you , love not fear 
 last prophets of past kind , who fill the dome 
 of great dead gods with wrath and wail , nor hear 
 time 's word and man 's : “ go honoured hence , go home 
 night 's childless children ; here your hour is done 
 pass with the stars , and leave us with the sun 

the beach was crowded . pausing now and then 
 he groped and fiddled doggedly along 
 his worn face glaring on the thoughtless throng 
 the stony peevishness of sightless men 
 he seemed scarce older than his clothes . again 
 grotesquing thinly many an old sweet song 
 so cracked his fiddle , his hand so frail and wrong 
 you hardly could distinguish one in ten 
 he stopped at last , and sat him on the sand 
 and , grasping wearily his bread winner 
 stared dim towards the blue immensity 
 then leaned his head upon his poor old hand 
 he may have slept : he did not speak nor stir 
 his gesture spoke a vast despondency 

was it the proud full sail of his great verse 
 bound for the prize of ( all too precious ) you 
 that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse 
 making their tomb the womb wherein they grew 
 was it his spirit , by spirits taught to write 
 above a mortal pitch , that struck me dead 
 no , neither he , nor his compeers by night 
 giving him aid , my verse astonished 
 he nor that affable familiar ghost 
 which nightly gulls him with intelligence 
 as victors of my silence cannot boast 
 i was not sick of any fear from thence 
 but when your countenance filled up his line 
 then lacked i matter , that enfeebled mine 

remember , man , ‘ the universal cause 
 acts not by partial , but by general laws 
 and makes what happiness we justly call 
 subsist , not in the good of one , but all 
 there 's not a blessing individuals find 
 but some way leans and hearkens to the kind 
 no bandit fierce , no tyrant mad with pride 
 no cavern 'd hermit , rests self satisfied 
 who most to shun or hate mankind pretend 
 seek an admirer , or would fix a friend 
 abstract what others feel , what others think 
 all pleasures sicken , and all glories sink 
 each has his share ; and who would more obtain 
 shall find , the pleasure pays not half the pain 

when pandarus beheld his brother kill 'd 
 the town with fear and wild confusion fill 'd 
 he turns the hinges of the heavy gate 
 with both his hands , and adds his shoulders to the weight 
 some happier friends within the walls inclos 'd 
 the rest shut out , to certain death expos 'd 
 fool as he was , and frantic in his care 
 t ’ admit young turnus , and include the war 
 he thrust amid the crowd , securely bold 
 like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold 
 too late his blazing buckler they descry 
 and sparkling fires that shot from either eye 
 his mighty members , and his ample breast 
 his rattling armor , and his crimson crest 

come down , o christ , and help me ! reach thy hand 
 for i am drowning in a stormier sea 
 than simon on thy lake of galilee 
 the wine of life is spilt upon the sand 
 my heart is as some famine murdered land 
 whence all good things have perished utterly 
 and well i know my soul in hell must lie 
 if i this night before god 's throne should stand 
 ‘ he sleeps perchance , or rideth to the chase 
 like baal , when his prophets howled that name 
 from morn to noon on carmel 's smitten height 
 nay , peace , i shall behold , before the night 
 the feet of brass , the robe more white than flame 
 the wounded hands , the weary human face 

let the world 's sharpness like a clasping knife 
 shut in upon itself and do no harm 
 in this close hand of love , now soft and warm 
 and let us hear no sound of human strife 
 after the click of the shutting . life to life 
 i lean upon thee , dear , without alarm 
 and feel as safe as guarded by a charm 
 against the stab of worldlings , who if rife 
 are weak to injure . very whitely still 
 the lilies of our lives may reassure 
 their blossoms from their roots , accessible 
 alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer 
 growing straight , out of man 's reach , on the hill 
 god only , who made us rich , can make us poor 

a modern hour from london ( as we spin 
 into a silver thread the miles of space 
 between us and our goal ) , there is a place 
 apart from city traffic , dust , and din 
 green with great trees , where hides a quiet inn 
 here nelson last looked on the lovely face 
 which made his world ; and by its magic grace 
 trailed rosy clouds across each early sin 
 and , leaning lawnward , is the room where keats 
 wrote the last one of those immortal songs 
 ( called by the critics of his day ‘ mere rhymes 
 a lark , high in the boxwood bough repeats 
 those lyric strains , to idle passing throngs 
 there by the little tavern of last times 

when you were born , beloved , was your soul 
 new made by god to match your body 's flower 
 and were they both at one same precious hour 
 sent forth from heaven as a perfect whole 
 or had your soul since dim creation burned 
 a star in some still region of the sky 
 that leaping earthward , left its place on high 
 and to your little new born body yearned 
 no words can tell in what celestial hour 
 god made your soul and gave it mortal birth 
 nor in the disarray of all the stars 
 is any place so sweet that such a flower 
 might linger there until thro ’ heaven 's bars 
 it heard god 's voice that bade it down to earth 

i grieve not that ripe knowledge takes away 
 the charm that nature to my childhood wore 
 for , with that insight , cometh , day by day 
 a greater bliss than wonder was before 
 the real doth not clip the poet 's wings 
 to win the secret of a weed 's plain heart 
 reveals some clue to spiritual things 
 and stumbling guess becomes firm footed art 
 flowers are not flowers unto the poet 's eyes 
 their beauty thrills him by an inward sense 
 he knows that outward seemings are but lies 
 or , at the most , but earthly shadows , whence 
 the soul that looks within for truth may guess 
 the presence of some wondrous heavenliness 

the scourge of life , and death 's extreme disgrace 
 the smoke of hell , the monster called pain 
 long shamed to be accursed in every place 
 by them who of his rude resort complain 
 like crafty wretch , by time and travel taught 
 his ugly evil in others ’ good to hide 
 late harbours in her face , whom nature wrought 
 as treasure house where her best gifts do bide 
 and so by privilege of sacred seat 
 a seat where beauty shines and virtue reigns 
 he hopes for some small praise , since she hath great 
 within her beams wrapping his cruel stains 
 ah , saucy pain , let not thy terror last 
 more loving eyes she draws , more hate thou hast 

but they came ,— the wind and sea 
 and rain and thunder , that in giant glee 
 sang o'er the lightnings pale , as to and fro 
 they writhed , like stricken angels !— white as snow 
 roll 'd billow after billow , and the tide 
 came forward as an army deep and wide 
 to charge with all its waters . there was heard 
 a murmur far and far , of those that stirr 'd 
 within the great encampment of the sea 
 and dark they were , and lifted terribly 
 their water spouts like banners . it was grand 
 to see the black battalions , hand in hand 
 striding to conflict , and their helmets bent 
 below their foamy plumes magnificent 

at length they reached the noble pillared hall 
 within the castle of the holy grail 
 for here the sacred feast was always kept 
 and here were gathering the bless è d knights 
 clothed were they all in tunics of gray blue 
 the color of the softened light of heaven 
 with mantles of pale scarlet , flowing free 
 the very tincture of the blood they served 
 and on the mantles snow white soaring doves 
 the symbol of the holy spirit 's gift 
 and with a solemn joy they took their place 
 along the tables of communing love 
 the while from the great vaulted dome above 
 came ever growing sound of chiming bells 

say what you will , there is not in the world 
 a nobler sight than from this upper down 
 no rugged landscape here , no beauty hurled 
 from its creator 's hand as with a frown 
 but a green plain on which green hills look down 
 trim as a garden plot . no other hue 
 can hence be seen , save here and there the brown 
 of a square fallow , and the horizon 's blue 
 dear checker work of woods , the sussex weald 
 if a name thrills me yet of things of earth 
 that name is thine ! how often i have fled 
 to thy deep hedgerows and embraced each field 
 each lag , each pasture ,— fields which gave me birth 
 and saw my youth , and which must hold me dead 

there were no heaven but for lovers ’ eyes 
 save in their depths do all elysiums fade 
 and gods were dead but for the life that lies 
 in kisses sweet on sweeter altars laid 
 there were no heroes did not lovers ride 
 and pyramid high deeds upon new time 
 nor tale for feast , or field , or chimney side 
 and harps were dumb and song had ne'er a rhyme 
 then live , proud heart , in happy fealty 
 nor sigh thee more thy dear bonds to remove 
 thou art not thrall to liege of mean degree 
 for all are kings who bear the lance of love 
 no wight so poor but may his tatters lose 
 and find his purple if his lady choose 

what scenes appear where'er i turn my view 
 the dear ideas , where i fly , pursue 
 rise in the grove , before the altar rise 
 stain all my soul , and wanton in my eyes 
 i waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee 
 thy image steals between my god and me 
 thy voice i seem in every hymn to hear 
 with every bead i drop too soft a tear 
 when from the censer clouds of fragrance roll 
 and swelling organs lift the rising soul 
 one thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight 
 priests , tapers , temples , swim before my sight 
 in seas of flame my plunging soul is drown 'd 
 while altars blaze , and angels tremble round 

as when it happ'neth that some lovely town 
 unto a barbarous besieger falls 
 who both by sword and flame himself installs 
 and , shameless , it in tears and blood doth drown 
 her beauty spoil 'd , her citizens made thralls 
 his spite yet cannot so her all throw down 
 but that some statue , pillar of renown 
 yet lurks unmaim 'd within her weeping walls 
 so , after all the spoil , disgrace , and wreck 
 that time , the world , and death , could bring combined 
 amidst that mass of ruins they did make 
 safe and all scarless yet remains my mind 
 from this so high transcending rapture springs 
 that i , all else defaced , not envy kings 

thou wouldst have led us through the twilight land 
 where spirit shows by form , form is refined 
 away to spirit by transfiguring mind 
 till they are one , and in the morn we stand 
 treading thy footsteps , children , hand in hand 
 with sense divinely growing , till , combined 
 we heard the music of the planets wind 
 in harmony with billows on the strand 
 till , one with earth and all god 's utterance 
 we hardly knew whether the sun outspake 
 or a glad sunshine from our spirits brake 
 whether we think , or windy leaflets dance 
 alas , o poet leader ! for this good 
 thou wert god 's tragedy , writ in tears and blood 

love , loyallest and lordliest born of things 
 immortal that shouldst be , though all else end 
 in plighted hearts of fearless friend with friend 
 whose hand may curb or clip thy plume plucked wings 
 not grief 's nor time 's : though these be lords and kings 
 crowned , and their yoke bid vassal passions bend 
 they may not pierce the spirit of sense , or blend 
 quick poison with the soul 's live watersprings 
 the true clear heart whose core is manful trust 
 fears not that very death may turn to dust 
 love lit therein as toward a brother born 
 if one touch make not all its fine gold rust 
 if one breath blight not all its glad ripe corn 
 and all its fire be turned to fire of scorn 

they say that lonely sorrows do not chance 
 i think it true , and that the cause i know 
 a sorrow glideth in a funeral show 
 easier than if it broke into a dance 
 but i think too , that joy doth joy enhance 
 as often as an added grief brings low 
 and if keen eyed to see the flowers that grow 
 as keen of nerve to feel the thorns that lance 
 the foot that must walk naked in one way 
 blest by the lily , white from toils and fears 
 oftener than wounded by the thistle spears 
 we should walk upright , bold , and earnest gay 
 i 'll tell you how it fared with me one day 
 after noon in a world , so called , of tears 

the shelves are full , all other themes are sped 
 hackneyed and worn to the last flimsy thread 
 satire has long since done his best , and curst 
 and loathsome ribaldry has done his worst 
 fancy has sported all her powers away 
 in tales , in trifles , and in children 's play 
 and ‘ tis the sad complaint , and almost true 
 whate'er we write , we bring forth nothing new 
 ‘ twere new indeed to see a bard all fire 
 touched with a coal from heaven , assume the lyre 
 and tell the world , still kindling as he sung 
 with more than mortal music on his tongue 
 that he who died below , and reigns above 
 inspires the song , and that his name is love 

feronde , a rich , but awkward , vulgar clown 
 a ninny was believed throughout the town 
 he had the charge of revenues not slight 
 which he collected for a friar white 
 of these i 've known as good as any black 
 when husbands some assistance seemed to lack

six thousand veterans practised in war 's game 
 tried men , at killicranky were arrayed 
 against an equal host that wore the plaid 
 shepherds and herdsmen .— like a whirlwind came 
 the highlanders , the slaughter spread like flame 
 and garry , thundering down his mountain road 
 was stopped , and could not breathe beneath the load 
 of the dead bodies .— ‘ twas a day of shame 
 for them whom precept and the pedantry 
 of cold mechanic battle do enslave

in attica thy birthplace should have been

by day she woos me , soft , exceeding fair 
 but all night as the moon so changeth she 
 loathsome and foul with hideous leprosy 
 and subtle serpents gliding in her hair 
 by day she woos me to the outer air 
 ripe fruits , sweet flowers , and full satiety 
 but through the night , a beast she grins at me 
 a very monster void of love and prayer 
 by day she stands a lie : by night she stands 
 in all the naked horror of the truth 
 with pushing horns and clawed and clutching hands 
 is this a friend indeed ; that i should sell 
 my soul to her , give her my life and youth 
 till my feet , cloven too , take hold on hell 

one vast creation , lately borne abroad 
 cheers the young nations like a nurturing god 
 breathes thro them all the same wide searching soul 
 forms , feeds , refines and animates the whole 
 guards every ground they gain , and forward brings 
 glad science soaring on cerulean wings 
 trims her gay plumes , directs her upward course 
 props her light pinions and sustains her force 
 instructs all men her golden gifts to prize 
 and catch new glories from her beamful eyes 
 tis the prolific press ; whose tablet , fraught 
 by graphic genius with his painted thought 
 flings forth by millions the prodigious birth 
 and in a moment stocks the astonish 'd earth 

and now with transport wild ernestus spies 
 dalarne 's continuous coast before him rise 
 ere yet he reach 'd the bank , the toiling oar 
 he dropp 'd , and sprung impatient to the shore 
 before him wide the dark brow 'd forests frown 'd 
 and morn 's still hour hush 'd all the space around 
 save where the whispers of the changeful breeze 
 half waved the summits of the towering trees 
 alone , and guided by a straggling beam 
 he hastened onward , where the murmuring stream 
 cut thro ’ the woods its liquid way , and laved 
 the grass , that round their trunks luxuriant waved 
 the willing woods an easy passage yield 
 and his glad footsteps reach the bordering field 

full on the sire the goddess of the skies

 and thus return ’ d :—" austere saturnius , say 
 from whence this wrath , or who controls thy sway

 jove to his thetis nothing could deny

“ big joss and little zeno , pray come here

 madame mahaud was speaker . moonlight there 
 caressingly enhanced her beauty rare 
 making it shine and tremble , as if she 
 so soft and gentle were of things that be 
 of air created , and are brought and ta'en 
 by heavenly flashes . now , she spoke again 
 “ certes , ‘ tis heavy purchase of a throne 
 to pass the night here utterly alone

who will believe my verse in time to come 
 if it were fill 'd with your most high deserts 
 though yet , heaven knows , it is but as a tomb 
 which hides your life and shows not half your parts 
 if i could write the beauty of your eyes 
 and in fresh numbers number all your graces 
 the age to come would say ‘ this poet lies 
 such heavenly touches ne'er touch 'd earthly faces 
 so should my papers , yellowed with their age 
 be scorn 'd , like old men of less truth than tongue 
 and your true rights be term 'd a poet 's rage 
 and stretched metre of an antique song 
 but were some child of yours alive that time 
 you should live twice , in it and in my rhyme 

there drew he forth the brand excalibur 
 and o'er him , drawing it , the winter moon 
 brightening the skirts of a long cloud , ran forth 
 and sparkled keen with frost against the hilt 
 for all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks 
 myriads of topaz lights , and jacinth work 
 of subtlest jewellery . he gazed so long 
 that both his eyes were dazzled as he stood 
 this way and that dividing the swift mind 
 in act to throw : but at the last it seem 'd 
 better to leave excalibur conceal 'd 
 there in the many knotted water flags 
 that whistled stiff and dry about the marge 
 so strode he back slow to the wounded king 

o world , thou choosest not the better part 
 it is not wisdom to be only wise

 but it is wisdom to believe the heart 
 columbus found a world , and had no chart 
 save one that faith deciphered in the skies 
 to trust the soul 's invincible surmise 
 was all his science and his only art 
 our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine

 across a void of mystery and dread 
 bid , then , the tender light of faith to shine 
 by which alone the mortal heart is led 
 unto the thinking of the thought divine 

if i could trust mine own self with your fate 
 shall i not rather trust it in god 's hand 
 without whose will one lily doth not stand 
 nor sparrow fall at his appointed date 
 who numbereth the innumerable sand 
 who weighs the wind and water with a weight 
 to whom the world is neither small nor great 
 whose knowledge foreknew every plan we planned 
 searching my heart for all that touches you 
 i find there only love and love 's goodwill 
 helpless to help and impotent to do 
 of understanding dull , of sight most dim 
 and therefore i commend you back to him 
 whose love your love 's capacity can fill

the same which pyrrhus and the puissaunce 
 of afrike could not tame , that same brave citie

 sustein 'd the shocke of common enmitie 
 long as her ship , tost with so manie freakes 
 had all the world in armes against her bent 
 was never seene that anie fortunes wreakes 
 could breake her course begun with brave intent 
 but , when the obiect of her vertue failed

when simple macer , now of high renown 
 first sought a poet 's fortune in the town 
 ‘ twas all the ambition his high soul could feel 
 to wear red stockings , and to dine with steele 
 some ends of verse his betters might afford 
 and gave the harmless fellow a good word 
 set up with these , he ventured on the town 
 and with a borrow 'd play , out did poor crowne 
 there he stopp 'd short , nor since has writ a tittle 
 but has the wit to make the most of little 
 like stunted , hide bound trees that just have got 
 sufficient sap at once to bear and rot 
 now he begs verse , and what he gets commends 
 not of the wits , his foes , but fools , his friends 

none other fame mine unambitious muse 
 affected ever but t'eternise thee 
 all other honours do my hopes refuse 
 which meaner prized and momentary be 
 for god forbid i should my papers blot 
 with mercenary lines with servile pen 
 praising virtues in them that have them not 
 basely attending on the hopes of men 
 no , no , my verse respects not thames , nor theatres 
 nor seeks it to be known unto the great 
 but avon , poor in fame , and poor in waters 
 shall have my song , where delia hath her seat 
 avon shall be my thames , and she my song 
 no other prouder brooks shall hear my wrong 

vii . and how shall he whose mission is to bring 
 the soul to worship at its rightful shrine 
 seeing in beauty what is most divine 
 give out the mightiest impulse , and thus fling 
 his soul into the future , scattering 
 the living seed of wisdom ? shall there shine 
 from underneath his hand a matchless line 
 of high earth beauties , till the wide world ring 
 with the far clang that tells a missioned soul 
 kneeling to homage all about his feet 
 alas for such a gift were this the whole 
 the only bread of life men had to eat 
 lo , i behold them dead about him now 
 and him the heart of death , for all that brow 

beholding youth and hope in mockery caught 
 from life ; and mocking pulses that remain 
 when the soul 's death of bodily death is fain 
 honour unknown , and honour known unsought 
 and penury 's sedulous self torturing thought 
 on gold , whose master therewith buys his bane 
 and longed for woman longing all in vain 
 for lonely man with love 's desire distraught 
 and wealth , and strength , and power , and pleasantness 
 given unto bodies of whose souls men say 
 none poor and weak , slavish and foul , as they 
 beholding these things , i behold no less 
 the blushing morn and blushing eve confess 
 the shame that loads the intolerable day 

day 's golden eye had closed , his ruddy light 
 expiring on the bosom of the night 
 and solitary twilight 's deepening shade 
 in dusky robe the firmament array 'd 
 the moon , resplendent , fill 'd her glittering throne 
 and tipp 'd with yellow gems all ether shone 
 the breeze was silent on the glassy deep 
 and half the world was sinking into sleep 
 save where the shepherd led his fleecy train 
 to crop the verdure of the moon light plain 
 save where the warder on the turret 's height 
 trimm 'd his weak lamp , and watch 'd the bell of night 
 and the lone captive , in the dungeon 's gloom 
 with beating pulse look 'd forward to his doom 

let woman fear to teach and bear to learn 
 remembering the first woman 's first mistake 
 eve had for pupil the inquiring snake 
 whose doubts she answered on a great concern 
 but he the tables so contrived to turn 
 it next was his to give and hers to take 
 till man deemed poison sweet for her sweet sake 
 and fired a train by which the world must burn 
 did adam love his eve from first to last 
 i think so ; as we love who works us ill 
 and wounds us to the quick , yet loves us still 
 love pardons the unpardonable past 
 love in a dominant embrace holds fast 
 his frailer self , and saves without her will 

afar in the desert i love to ride 
 with the silent bush boy alone by my side 
 o'er the brown karroo , where the bleating cry 
 of the springbok 's fawn sounds plaintively 
 and the timorous quagga 's shrill whistling neigh 
 is heard by the fountain at twilight gray 
 where the zebra wantonly tosses his mane 
 with wild hoof scouring the desolate plain 
 and the fleet footed ostrich over the waste 
 speeds like a horseman who travels in haste 
 hieing away to the home of her rest 
 where she and her mate have scooped their nest 
 far hid from the pitiless plunderer 's view 
 in the pathless depths of the parched karroo 

up at his attic sill the south wind came 
 and days of sun and storm but never peace 
 along the town 's tumultuous arteries 
 he heard the heart throbs of a sentient frame 
 each night the whistles in the bay , the same 
 whirl of incessant wheels and clanging cars 
 for smoke that half obscured , the circling stars 
 burnt like his youth with but a sickly flame 
 up to his attic came the city cries 
 the throes with which her iron sinews heave 
 and yet forever behind prison doors 
 welled in his heart and trembled in his eyes 
 the light that hangs on desert hills at eve 
 and tints the sea on solitary shores 

o lords our gods , the times are evil : you 
 redeem the time , because of evil days 
 while abject souls in servitude of praise 
 bow down to heads untitled , and the crew 
 whose honour dwells but in the deeds they do 
 from loftier hearts your nobler servants raise 
 more manful salutation : yours are bays 
 that not the dawn 's plebeian pearls bedew 
 yours , laurels plucked not of such hands as wove 
 old age its chaplet in colonos ’ grove 
 our time , with heaven and with itself at odds 
 makes all lands else as seas that seethe and boil 
 but yours are yet the corn and wine and oil 
 and yours our worship yet , o lords our gods 

so is it with this singing art of ours 
 that once with maids went maidenlike , and played 
 with woven dances in the poplar shade 
 and all her song was but of lady 's bowers 
 and the returning swallows , and spring flowers 
 till forth to seek a shadow queen she strayed 
 a shadowy land ; and now hath overweighed 
 her singing chaplet with the snow and showers 
 yea , fair well water for the bitter brine 
 she left , and by the margin of life 's sea 
 sings , and her song is full of the sea 's moan 
 and wild with dread , and love of proserpine 
 and whoso once has listened to her , he 
 his whole life long is slave to her alone 

“ too late , o friend ! my rashness i deplore 
 these shafts , once fatal , carry death no more 
 tydeus ’ and atreus ’ sons their points have found 
 and undissembled gore pursued the wound 
 in vain they bleed : this unavailing bow 
 serves , not to slaughter , but provoke the foe 
 in evil hour these bended horns i strung 
 and seized the quiver where it idly hung 
 cursed be the fate that sent me to the field 
 without a warrior ’ s arms , the spear and shield 
 if e ’ er with life i quit the trojan plain 
 if e ’ er i see my spouse and sire again 
 this bow , unfaithful to my glorious aims 
 broke by my hand , shall feed the blazing flames 

she turns her head and in a flash of laughter 
 looks up at him : and helplessly he feels 
 that life has circled with returning wheels 
 back to a starting point . before and after 
 merge in this instant , momently the same 
 for it was thus she leaned and laughing turned 
 when , manifest , the spirit of beauty burned 
 in her young body with an inward flame 
 and first he knew and loved her . in full tide 
 life halts within him , suddenly stupefied 
 sight blackness , lightning struck ; but blindly tender 
 he draws her up to meet him , and she lies 
 close folded by his arms in glad surrender 
 smiling , and with drooped head and half closed eyes 

how yesterday is long ago ! the past 
 is a fixed infinite distance from to day 
 and bygone things , the first lived as the last 
 in irreparable sameness far away 
 how the to be is infinitely ever 
 out of the place wherein it will be now 
 like the seen wave yet far up in the river 
 which reaches not us , but the new waved flow 
 this thing time is , whose being is having none 
 the equable tyrant of our different fates 
 who could not be bought off by a shattered sun 
 or tricked by new use of our careful dates 
 this thing time is , that to the grave will bear 
 my heart , sure but of it and of my fear 

as the blind man behind his leader walks 
 lest he should err , or stumble unawares 
 on what might harm him , or perhaps destroy 
 i journey 'd through that bitter air and foul 
 still list'ning to my escort 's warning voice 
 “ look that from me thou part not . ” straight i heard 
 voices , and each one seem 'd to pray for peace 
 and for compassion , to the lamb of god 
 that taketh sins away . their prelude still 
 was “ agnus dei , ” and through all the choir 
 one voice , one measure ran , that perfect seem 'd 
 the concord of their song . “ are these i hear 
 spirits , o master ? ” i exclaim 'd ; and he 
 “ thou aim'st aright : these loose the bonds of wrath 

then as a bride in all her glory decked 
 approaches with a gladdened heart t ’ embrace 
 th ’ expectant bridegroom on the nuptial bed 
 e'en so ascended this fair queen the pyre 
 and there embracing lay by her dear lord 
 the fire was lighted and the pyre was closed 
 and speedily to ashes were reduced 
 the lifeless husband and the living wife 
 the moslem came — heard of the death she died 
 amid the flames , repented of his deed 
 and , it is said , he built a lordly town 
 in honour of the queen , who counted it 
 a sin her noble husband to survive 
 and in a moment flung her life away 

above , the sire of gods his thunder rolls 
 and peals on peals redoubled rend the poles 
 beneath , stern neptune shakes the solid ground 
 the forests wave , the mountains nod around 
 through all their summits tremble ida ’ s woods 
 and from their sources boil her hundred floods 
 troy ’ s turrets totter on the rocking plain 
 and the toss ’ d navies beat the heaving main 
 deep in the dismal regions of the dead 
 the infernal monarch rear ’ d his horrid head 
 leap ’ d from his throne , lest neptune ’ s arm should lay 
 his dark dominions open to the day 
 and pour in light on pluto ’ s drear abodes 
 abhorr ’ d by men , and dreadful even to gods 

keep love for youth , and violets for the spring 
 or if these bloom when worn out autumn grieves 
 let them lie hid in double shade of leaves 
 their own , and others dropped down withering 
 for violets suit when home birds build and sing 
 not when the outbound bird a passage cleaves 
 not with dry stubble of mown harvest sheaves 
 but when the green world buds to blossoming 
 keep violets for the spring , and love for youth 
 love that should dwell with beauty , mirth , and hope 
 or if a later sadder love be born 
 let this not look for grace beyond its scope 
 but give itself , nor plead for answering truth 
 a grateful ruth tho ’ gleaning scanty corn 

with how sad steps , o moon ! thou climb'st the skies 
 how silently , and with how wan a face 
 what ! may it be , that even in heavenly place 
 that busy archer his sharp arrows tries 
 sure , if that long with love acquainted eyes 
 can judge of love , thou feel'st a lover 's case 
 i read it in thy looks ; thy languish 'd grace 
 to me that feel the like , thy state descries 
 then , even of fellowship , o moon , tell me 
 is constant love deem 'd there but want of wit 
 are beauties there as proud as here they be 
 do they above love to be loved , and yet 
 those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess 
 do they call virtue there ungratefulness 

my song i do but hold for you in trust 
 i ask you but to blossom from my dust 
 when you have compassed all weak i began 
 diviner poet , and ah ! diviner man 
 the man at feud with the perduring child 
 in you before song 's altar nobly reconciled 
 from the wise heavens i half shall smile to see 
 how little a world , which owned you , needed me 
 if , while you keep the vigils of the night 
 for your wild tears make darkness all too bright 
 some lone orb through your lonely window peeps 
 as it played lover over your sweet sleeps 
 think it a golden crevice in the sky 
 which i have pierced but to behold you by 

o lest the world should task you to recite 
 what merit lived in me that you should love 
 after my death ( dear love ) forget me quite 
 for you in me can nothing worthy prove 
 unless you would devise some virtuous lie 
 to do more for me than mine own desert 
 and hang more praise upon deceased i 
 than niggard truth would willingly impart 
 o lest your true love may seem false in this 
 that you for love speak well of me untrue 
 my name be buried where my body is 
 and live no more to shame nor me , nor you 
 for i am shamed by that which i bring forth 
 and so should you , to love things nothing worth 

bless è d that flock safe penned in paradise 
 bless è d this flock which tramps in weary ways 
 all form one flock , god 's flock ; all yield him praise 
 by joy or pain , still tending toward the prize 
 joy speaks in praises there , and sings and flies 
 where no night is , exulting all its days 
 here , pain finds solace , for , behold , it prays 
 in both love lives the life that never dies 
 here life is the beginning of our death 
 and death the starting point whence life ensues 
 surely our life is death , our death is life 
 nor need we lay to heart our peace or strife 
 but calm in faith and patience breathe the breath 
 god gave , to take again when he shall choose

thus labour 'd thro ’ the night the long hair 'd greeks 
 the gods , assembled in the courts of jove 
 with wonder view 'd the mighty work ; and thus 
 neptune , earth shaking king , his speech began 
 “ o father jove , in all the wide spread earth

let not the scornful ask me what avails 
 so small a pack to follow mighty trails 
 long since i saw what difference must be 
 between a stream like you , a ditch like me 
 this drains a garden and a homely field 
 which scarce at times a living current yield

 so far the breast with fiercer longing pants

 and say , glad soul , rejoice , for thou and i 
 of bliss unpaired are made participants 
 hence have come ardent thoughts and waking dreams

 through her the woman 's perfect beauty gleams 
 that while it gazes lifts the spirit up 
 to that high source from which all beauty springs

 a voice heard singing music , large and free 
 and from that moment life is changed , and we 
 become of more heroic temper , meet 
 to freely ask and give , a man complete 
 radiant because of faith , we dare to be 
 what nature meant us . brave idolatry 
 which can conceive a hero ! no deceit 
 no knowledge taught by unrelenting years 
 can quench this fierce , untamable desire 
 we know that what we long for once achieved 
 will cease to satisfy . be still our fears 
 if what we worship fail us , still the fire 
 burns on , and it is much to have believed 

be it not mine to steal the cultured flower 
 from any garden of the rich and great 
 nor seek with care , through many a weary hour 
 some novel form of wonder to create 
 enough for me the leafy woods to rove 
 and gather simple cups of morning dew 
 or , in the fields and meadows that i love 
 find beauty in their bells of every hue 
 thus round my cottage floats a fragrant air 
 and though the rustic plot be humbly laid 
 yet , like the lilies gladly growing there 
 i have not toiled , but take what god has made 
 my lord ambition passed , and smiled in scorn 
 i plucked a rose , and , lo ! it had no thorn 

was it the worke of nature or of art 
 which tempred so the feature of her face 
 that pride and meeknesse , mist by equall part 
 doe both appeare t'adorne her beauties grace 
 for with mild pleasance , which doth pride displace 
 she to her love doth lookers eyes allure 
 and with stern countenance back again doth chace 
 their looser lookes that stir up lustes impure 
 with such strange termes * her eyes she doth inure 
 that with one looke she doth my life dismay 
 and with another doth it streight recure 
 her smile me drawes ; her frowne me drives away 
 thus doth she traine and teach me with her lookes 
 such art of eyes i never read in bookes 

accuse me thus , that i have scanted all 
 wherein i should your great deserts repay 
 forgot upon your dearest love to call 
 whereto all bonds do tie me day by day 
 that i have frequent been with unknown minds 
 and given to time your own dear purchased right 
 that i have hoisted sail to all the winds 
 which should transport me farthest from your sight 
 book both my wilfulness and errors down 
 and on just proof surmise , accumulate 
 bring me within the level of your frown 
 but shoot not at me in your wakened hate 
 since my appeal says i did strive to prove 
 the constancy and virtue of your love 

what wol ye more ? the crowe anon him tolde 
 by sadde tokenes and by wordes bolde 
 how that his wyf had doon hir lecherye

love is a breach in the walls , a broken gate 
 where that comes in that shall not go again 
 love sells the proud heart 's citadel to fate 
 they have known shame , who love unloved . even then 
 when two mouths , thirsty each for each , find slaking 
 and agony 's forgot , and hushed the crying 
 of credulous hearts , in heaven — such are but taking 
 their own poor dreams within their arms , and lying 
 each in his lonely night , each with a ghost 
 some share that night . but they know love grows colder 
 grows false and dull , that was sweet lies at most 
 astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder 
 but darkens , and dies out from kiss to kiss 
 all this is love ; and all love is but this 

that you were once unkind befriends me now 
 and for that sorrow , which i then did feel 
 needs must i under my transgression bow 
 unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel 
 for if you were by my unkindness shaken 
 as i by yours , y'have passed a hell of time 
 and i a tyrant have no leisure taken 
 to weigh how once i suffered in your crime 
 o that our night of woe might have remembered 
 my deepest sense , how hard true sorrow hits 
 and soon to you , as you to me then tendered 
 the humble salve , which wounded bosoms fits 
 but that your trespass now becomes a fee 
 mine ransoms yours , and yours must ransom me 

“ speak , then , and tell me , sir ganelon 
 how may roland to death be done 
 “ through cizra 's pass will the emperor wind 
 but his rear will linger in march behind 
 roland and olivier there shall be 
 with twenty thousand in company 
 muster your battle against them then 
 a hundred thousand heathen men 
 till worn and spent be the frankish bands 
 though your bravest perish beneath their hands 
 for another battle your powers be massed 
 roland will sink , overcome at last 
 there were a feat of arms indeed 
 and your life from peril thenceforth be freed 

she said , and for her lost galanthis sighs 
 when the fair consort of her son replies 
 ‘ since you a servant 's ravish 'd form bemoan 
 and kindly sigh for sorrows not your own 
 let me ( if tears and grief permit ) relate 
 a nearer woe , a sister 's stranger fate 
 no nymph of all oechalia could compare 
 for beauteous form with dryope the fair 
 her tender mother 's only hope and pride 
 ( myself the offspring of a second bride

vanguard of liberty , ye men of kent 
 ye children of a soil that doth advance 
 it 's haughty brow against the coast of france 
 now is the time to prove your hardiment 
 to france be words of invitation sent 
 they from their fields can see the countenance 
 of your fierce war , may ken the glittering lance 
 and hear you shouting forth your brave intent 
 left single , in bold parley , ye , of yore 
 did from the norman win a gallant wreath 
 confirm 'd the charters that were yours before 
 no parleying now ! in britain is one breath 
 we all are with you now from shore to shore 
 ye men of kent , ‘ tis victory or death 

far yonder , where orchards and gardens lie 
 and dwellings cluster , ‘ tis there men die 
 they are born , they die , and are buried near 
 where the populous grave yard lightens the bier 
 for strict and close are the ties that bind 
 in death the children of human kind 
 yea , stricter and closer than those of life 
 ‘ tis a neighbourhood that knows no strife 
 they are noiselessly gathered — friend and foe 
 to the still and dark assemblies below 
 without a frown or a smile they meet 
 each pale and calm in his winding sheet 
 in that sullen home of peace and gloom 
 crowded , like guests in a banquet room 

we , like the leaf , the summit , or the wave 
 reflect the light our common nature gave 
 but every sunbeam , falling from her throne 
 wears on our hearts some coloring of our own 
 chilled in the slave , and burning in the free 
 like the sealed cavern by the sparkling sea 
 lost , like the lightning in the sullen clod 
 or shedding radiance , like the smiles of god 
 pure , pale in virtue , as the star above 
 or quivering roseate on the leaves of love 
 glaring like noontide , where it glows upon 
 ambition 's sands ,— the desert in the sun 
 or soft suffusing o'er the varied scene 
 life 's common coloring ,— intellectual green 

if thou survive my well contented day 
 when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover 
 and shalt by fortune once more re survey 
 these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover 
 compare them with the bett'ring of the time 
 and though they be outstripped by every pen 
 reserve them for my love , not for their rhyme 
 exceeded by the height of happier men 
 o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought 
 ‘ had my friend 's muse grown with this growing age 
 a dearer birth than this his love had brought 
 to march in ranks of better equipage 
 but since he died and poets better prove 
 theirs for their style i 'll read , his for his love 

in the chill silence of the winter eve 
 thro ’ lichfield 's darken 'd streets i bend my way 
 by that sad mansion , where nerina 's clay 
 awaits the morning knell ;— and awed perceive 
 in the late bridal chamber , the clear ray 
 of numerous lights ; while o'er the ceiling stray 
 shadows of those who frequent pass beneath 
 round the pale dead .— what sounds my senses grieve 
 for now the busy hammer 's stroke appals 
 that , “ in dread note of preparation ,” falls 
 closing the sable lid !— with sighs i bear 
 these solemn warnings from the house of woes 
 pondering how late , for young nerina , there 
 joyous , the love illumin 'd morn arose 

soon as she spreads her hand , th ’ a ë rial guard 
 descend , and sit on each important card 
 first ariel perch 'd upon a matadore 
 then each , according to the rank they bore 
 for sylphs , yet mindful of their ancient race 
 are , as when women , wondrous fond of place 
 behold , four kings in majesty rever 'd 
 with hoary whiskers and a forky beard 
 and four fair queens whose hands sustain a flow'r 
 th ’ expressive emblem of their softer pow'r 
 four knaves in garbs succinct , a trusty band 
 caps on their heads , and halberts in their hand 
 and particolour 'd troops , a shining train 
 draw forth to combat on the velvet plain 

to this the king :— “ rejoice we then to day 
 and on the morrow marshal our array 
 the monarch quick commands the feast of joy 
 and social cares his buoyant mind employ 
 within a bower , beside a crystal spring 
 where opening flowers , refreshing odours fling 
 cheerful he sits , and forms the banquet scene 
 in regal splendour on the crowded green 
 and as around he greets his valiant bands 
 showers golden presents from his bounteous hands 
 voluptuous damsels trill the sportive lay 
 whose sparkling glances beam celestial day 
 fill 'd with delight the heroes closer join 
 and quaff till midnight cups of generous wine 

yea , lord , my mouth would praise thee ere i die 
 the father , and the son , and holy spirit 
 who knittest in his church the just to christ 
 help me , my sons — mine orphans soon to be   
 help me to praise him ; ye that round me sit 
 on those grey rocks ; ye that have faithful been 
 honouring , despite dishonour of my sins 
 his servant : i would praise him yet once more 
 though mine the stammerer 's voice , or as a child 's 
 for it is written , “ stammerers shall speak plain 
 sounding thy gospel . ” “ they whom christ hath sent 
 are christ 's epistle , borne to ends of earth 
 writ by his spirit , and plain to souls elect 
 lord , am not i of thine apostolate 

my love is lyke to yse , and i to fyre 
 how comes it then that this her cold so great 
 is not dissolv 'd through my so hot desyre 
 but harder growes the more i her intreat 
 or how comes it that my exceeding heat 
 is not delayd * by her hart frosen cold 
 but that i burne much more in boyling sweat 
 and feele my flames augmented manifold 
 what more miraculous thing may be told 
 that fire , which all things melts , should harden yse 
 and yse , which is congeald with sencelesse cold 
 should kindle fyre by wonderful devyse 
 such is the powre of love in gentle mind 
 that it can alter all the course of kynd 

then to achilles ’ tomb the host returned 
 and led the maid , as calf by herdmen dragged 
 for sacrifice , from woodland pastures torn 
 from its mother 's side , and lowing long and loud 
 it moans with anguished heart ; so priam 's child 
 wailed in the hands of foes . down streamed her tears 
 as when beneath the heavy sacks of sand 
 olives clear skinned , ne'er blotched by drops of storm 
 pour out their oil , when the long levers creak 
 as strong men strain the cords ; so poured the tears 
 of travail burdened priam 's daughter , haled 
 to stern achilles ’ tomb , tears blent with moans 
 drenched were her bosom folds , glistened the drops 
 on flesh clear white as costly ivory 

‘ come , gentle air ! ’ the aeolian shepherd said 
 while procris panted in the secret shade 
 ‘ come , gentle air ! ’ the fairer delia cries 
 while at her feet her swain expiring lies 
 lo ! the glad gales o'er all her beauties stray 
 breathe on her lips , and in her bosom play 
 in delia 's hand this toy is fatal found 
 nor could that fabled dart more surely wound 
 both gifts destructive to the givers prove 
 alike both lovers fall by those they love 
 yet guiltless too this bright destroyer lives 
 at random wounds , nor knows the wound she gives 
 she views the story with attentive eyes 
 and pities procris , while her lover dies 

i like the man who faces what he must 
 with step triumphant and a heart of cheer 
 who fights the daily battle without fear 
 sees his hopes fail , yet keeps unfaltering trust 
 that god is god ; that somehow , true and just 
 his plans work out for mortals ; not a tear 
 is shed when fortune , which the world holds dear 
 falls from his grasp : better , with love , a crust 
 than living in dishonor : envies not 
 nor loses faith in man ; but does his best 
 nor ever murmurs at his humbler lot 
 but , with a smile and words of hope , gives zest 
 to every toiler : he alone is great 
 who by a life heroic conquers fate 

at length he said :— i know not what to do 
 undressing , by myself , i can n't pursue 
 shall i your valet call ? rejoined the fair 
 on no account , said he , with looks of care 
 i would not have you in my chamber seen 
 nor thought that here , by night , a girl had been 
 your caution is enough , the belle replied 
 myself between the wall and bed i 'll hide 
 ‘ twill what you fear prevent , and ills avoid 
 but bolt the door : you 'll then be not annoyed 
 let no one come ; for once i 'll do my best 
 and as your valet act till you 're undressed 
 to am'rous constance this permission grant 
 the honour would her throbbing breast enchant 

then from the depths , in bitterness she cried 
 ‘ hell is on earth , and heaven is but a dream 
 and human life a troubled aimless stream 
 and god is nowhere . would god so deride 
 a loving creature 's faith ? ’ a voice replied 
 ‘ the stream flows onward to the source supreme 
 where things that are replace the things that seem 
 and where the deeds of all past lives abide 
 once at thy door love languished and was spurned 
 who sorrow plants , must garner sorrow 's sheaf 
 no prayers can change the seedling in the sod 
 by thine own heart love 's anguish must be learned 
 pass on , and know , as one made wise by grief 
 that in thyself dwells heaven and hell and god 

the world is too much with us ; late and soon 
 getting and spending , we lay waste our powers 
 little we see in nature that is ours 
 we have given our hearts away , a sordid boon 
 this sea that bares her bosom to the moon 
 the winds that will be howling at all hours 
 and are up gathered now like sleeping flowers 
 for this , for everything , we are out of tune 
 it moves us not .— great god ! i 'd rather be 
 a pagan suckled in a creed outworn 
 so might i , standing on this pleasant lea 
 have glimpses that would make me less forlorn 
 have sight of proteus rising from the sea 
 or hear old triton blow his wreathed horn 

when these sad sights were overpast and gone 
 my spright was greatly moved in her rest 
 with inward ruth and deare affection 
 to see so great things by so small distrest 
 thenceforth i gan in my engrieved brest 
 to scorne all difference of great and small 
 sith that the greatest often are opprest 
 and unawares doe into daunger fall 
 and ye , that read these ruines tragicall 
 learne , by their losse , to love the low degree 
 and if that fortune chaunce you up to call 
 to honours seat , forget not what you be 
 for he that of himselfe is most secure 
 shall finde his state most fickle and unsure 

look , when the rose to deep vermilion hue 
 adds that sweet odour gracious nature gives 
 when his proud glory gladdens every view 
 and no base worm within his beauties lives 
 we nothing question of what sex it be 
 nor ask more of it than that it should lend 
 his lovely gaze for ravish 'd eye to see 
 and on the blessed air his fragrance spend 
 we ask not that the star which lights the heaven 
 should be or male or female to our sense 
 suffic 'd in this , that it empearls the even 
 and happies all our under reverence 
 then might'st not thou , who wert both rose and star 
 be pure to me as these to others are 

or dost thou mourn that the house of god 
 has ceased to be a divine abode 
 that the holy spirit , which erst did brood 
 o'er the son of man by jordan 's flood 
 in thine own pure form to the eye of sense 
 from its resting place has departed hence 
 and twitters the swallow , and wheels the bat 
 o'er the mercy seat where its presence sat 
 i have marked thy trembling breast , and heard 
 with a heart responsive thy tones , sweet bird 
 and have mourned , like thee , of earth 's fairest things 
 the blight and the loss — oh ! had i thy wings 
 from a world of woe to the realms of the blest 
 i would flee away , and would be at rest 

the winds have talked with him confidingly 
 the trees have whispered to him ; and the night 
 hath held him gently as a mother might 
 and taught him all sad tones of melody 
 the mountains have bowed to him ; and the sea 
 in clamorous waves , and murmurs exquisite 
 hath told him all her sorrow and delight 
 her legends fair — her darkest mystery 
 his verse blooms like a flower , night and day 
 bees cluster round his rhymes ; and twitterings 
 of lark and swallow , in an endless may 
 are mingling with the tender songs he sings 
 nor shall he cease to sing — in every lay 
 of nature 's voice he sings — and will alway 

but soon the morn , on many a distant height 
 fingers the raven locks of lingering night 
 the last dark shadows that precede the day 
 have stripped the splendour from the milky way 
 and nature seems disturbed by fitful dreams 
 as one who shudders when the owlet screams 
 the painful burden of the whippoorwill 
 like a vague sorrow , floats from hill to hill 
 along the vales the doleful accents run 
 where the white vapours dread the burning sun 
 while human voices stir the haunted air 
 one sings “ the plough , ” another warbles “ claire 
 the happy harvesters , a lightsome throng 
 dispersing homewards , prove the excellence of song 

what matters that her multitudinous store 
 the garnered fruit of measureless desire 
 sank in the maelstrom of abysmal fire 
 to be of man beheld on earth no more 
 her loyal children , cheery to the core 
 quailed not , nor blenched , while she , above the ire 
 of elemental ragings , dared aspire 
 on victory 's wings resplendently to soar 
 what matters all the losses of the years 
 since she can count the subjects as her own 
 that share her fortunes under every fate 
 who weave their brightest tissues from her tears 
 and who , although her best be overthrown 
 resolve to make her and to keep her great 

what ! you whip rascals ?— you , whose gutter blood 
 bears , in its dark , dishonorable flood 
 enough of prison birds ’ prolific germs 
 to serve a whole eternity of terms 
 you , for whose back the rods and cudgels strove 
 ere yet the ax had hewn them from the grove 
 you , the de young whose splendor bright and brave 
 is phosphorescence from another 's grave 
 till now unknown , by any chance or luck 
 even to the hearts at which you , feebly struck 
 you whip a rascal out of office ?— you 
 whose leadless weapon once ignobly blew 
 its smoke in six directions to assert 
 your lack of appetite for others ’ dirt 

why dost thou , delia , credit so thy glass 
 gazing thy beauty deigned thee by the skies 
 and dost not rather look on him , alas 
 whose state best shows the force of murdering eyes 
 the broken tops of lofty trees declare 
 the fury of a mercy wanting storm 
 and of what force thy wounding graces are 
 upon myself , you best may find the form 
 then leave thy glass , and gaze thyself on me 
 that mirror shows what power is in thy face 
 to view your form too much may danger be 
 narcissus changed t'a flower in such a case 
 and you are changed , but not t'a hyacinth 
 i fear your eye hath turned your heart to flint 

ye tradefull merchants , that , with weary toyle 
 do seeke most pretious things to make your gain 
 and both the indias of their treasure spoile 
 what needeth you to seeke so farre in vaine 
 for loe , my love doth in her selfe containe 
 all this worlds riches that may farre be found 
 if saphyres , loe , her eies be saphyres plaine 
 if rubies , loe , hir lips be rubies sound 
 if pearles , hir teeth be pearles , both pure and round 
 if yvorie , her forhead yvory weene 
 if gold , her locks are finest gold on ground 
 if silver , her faire hands are silver sheene 
 but that which fairest is but few behold 
 her mind adornd with vertues manifold 

o watcher at the guardless gate of kings 
 o doorkeeper that serving at their feast 
 hast in thine hand their doomsday drink , and seest 
 with eyeless sight the soul of unseen things 
 thou in whose ear the dumb time coming sings 
 death , priest and king that makest of king and priest 
 a name , a dream , a less thing than the least 
 hover awhile above him with closed wings 
 till the coiled soul , an evil snake shaped beast 
 eat its base bodily lair of flesh away 
 if haply , or ever its cursed life have ceased 
 or ever thy cold hands cover his head 
 from sight of france and freedom and broad day 
 he may see these and wither and be dead 

thou , from the first , unborn , undying love 
 albeit we gaze not on thy glories near 
 before the face of god didst breath and move 
 though night and pain and ruin and death reign here 
 thou foldest , like a golden atmosphere 
 the very throne of the eternal god 
 passing through thee the edicts of his fear 
 are mellowed into music , borne abroad 
 by the loud winds , though they uprend the sea 
 even from his central deeps : thine empery 
 is over all : thou wilt not brook eclipse 
 thou goest and returnest to his lips 
 like lightning : thou dost ever brood above 
 the silence of all hearts , unutterable love 

to love and to remember ; that is good 
 to love and to forget ; that is not well 
 to lapse from love to hatred ; that is hell 
 and death and torment , rightly understood 
 soul dazed by love and sorrow , cheer thy mood 
 more blest art thou than mortal tongue can tell 
 ring not thy funeral but thy marriage bell 
 and salt with hope thy life 's insipid food 
 love is the goal , love is the way we wend 
 love is our parallel unending line 
 whose only perfect parallel is christ 
 beginning not begun , end without end 
 for he who hath the heart of god sufficed 
 can satisfy all hearts ,— yea , thine and mine

but to return to our forlorn gallant 
 whose bosom for the lady 's ‘ gan to pant 
 he , to his doctor , not a word had said 
 now here , now there , he tried to pop his head 
 but neither door nor window could he find 
 where he might glimpse the object of his mind 
 or even hear her voice , or sound her name 
 no fortress had he ever found the same 
 yet still to conquer he was quite resolved 
 and oft the manner in his mind revolved 
 this plan at length he thought would best succeed 
 to execute it doubtless he had need 
 of ev'ry wily art he could devise 
 surrounded as he was by eagle eyes 

the kind instructor in these words began 
 “ ere farther thou proceed , know thou art now 
 i ’ th ’ second round , and shalt be , till thou come 
 upon the horrid sand : look therefore well 
 around thee , and such things thou shalt behold 
 as would my speech discredit . ” on all sides 
 i heard sad plainings breathe , and none could see 
 from whom they might have issu 'd . in amaze 
 fast bound i stood . he , as it seem 'd , believ 'd 
 that i had thought so many voices came 
 from some amid those thickets close conceal 'd 
 and thus his speech resum 'd : “ if thou lop off 
 a single twig from one of those ill plants 
 the thought thou hast conceiv 'd shall vanish quite 

but there was more . a jay with skyblue shaft 
 set in blunt wing , skimmed screaming on ahead 
 she followed him . a murrey squirrel eyed 
 her warily , cocked upon tail plumed haunch 
 then , skipping the whirligig of last year leaves 
 whisked himself out of sight and reappeared 
 leering about the hole of a young beech 
 and every time she thought to corner him 
 he scrambled round on little scratchy hands 
 to peek at her about the other side 
 she lost him , bolting branch to branch , at last 
 the impudent brat ! but still high overhead 
 flight on exuberant flight of opal scud 
 or of dissolving mist , florid as flame 

that day , to great achilles son resign 'd 
 hermione , the fairest of her kind 
 was sent to crown the long protracted joy 
 espoused before the final doom of troy 
 with steeds and gilded cars , a gorgeous train 
 attend the nymphs to phthia 's distant reign 
 meanwhile at home , to megapentha 's bed 
 the virgin choir alector 's daughter led 
 brave megapenthas from a stolen amour 
 to great atrides ’ age his handmaid bore 
 to helen 's bed the gods alone assign 
 hermione , to extend the regal line 
 on whom a radiant pomp oh graces wait 
 resembling venus in attractive state 

thro each colonial realm , for wisdom great 
 elected sires assume the cares of state 
 nursed in equality , to freedom bred 
 firm is their step and straight the paths they tread 
 dispensing justice with paternal hand 
 by laws of peace they rule the happy land 
 while reason 's page their statute codes unfold 
 and rites and charters flame in figured gold 
 all rights that britons know they here transfuse 
 their sense invigorate and expand their views 
 dare every height of human soul to scan 
 find , fathom , scope the moral breadth of man 
 learn how his social powers may still dilate 
 and tone their tension to a stronger state 

all day i 've bent my heart beneath the yoke 
 of goading toil , remembering to forget 
 to still upon my lips his kiss that woke 
 me in elysian love one word has broke 
 one stinging word of severance and regret 
 all day i 've blotted from my eyes his face 
 but now at evening tide it comes again 
 and memories into my darkened soul 
 rush as the stars into high heaven 's space 
 as the bright stars ! but , ah , tomorrow ! when 
 once more i must forget and see life 's goal 
 that was so green , with sering laurel hung 
 tomorrow and tomorrow ! till is wrung 
 peace from the piteous hours i strive among 

the prioress , this secret to disclose 
 appeared with spectacles upon her nose 
 and twenty nuns around a dress displayed 
 that convent mantua makers never made 
 imagine to yourself what felt the youth 
 ‘ mid this examination of the truth 
 the nice proportions and the lily charms 
 soon raised within his bosom dire alarms 
 like magick operated on the string 
 and from it , what was tied , soon gave a spring 
 broke loose at once , just like a mettled steed 
 that , having slipt its halter , flies with speed 
 against the abbess ’ nose with force it flew 
 and spectacles from her proboscis threw 

go now , my friend , drink in with all your eyes 
 bronze , silver , marble , gems , and tyrian dyes 
 feel pride when speaking in the sight of rome 
 go early out to ‘ change and late come home 
 for fear your income drop beneath the rate 
 that comes to mutus from his wife 's estate 
 and ( shame and scandal !) , though his line is new 
 you give the pas to him , not he to you

 while things get hid in turn that once looked bright 
 so when agrippa 's mall and appius ’ way 
 have watched your well known figure day by day 
 at length the summons comes , and you must go 
 to numa and to ancus down below 

then mua leads him through the glorious land 
 of matchless splendor , on the border grand 
 of those wide happy fields that spread afar 
 o'er beaming hills and vales , where ambient air 
 with sweetest zephyrs sweeps a grand estrade 
 where softest odors from each flowering glade 
 lull every sense aswoon that breathes not bliss 
 and harmony with world of blessedness 
 ‘ neath trees of luring fruits she leads the way 
 through paths of flowers where night hath fled away 
 a wilderness of varied crystal flowers 
 where fragrance rests o'er clustering , shining bowers 
 each gleaming cup its nectared wine distils 
 for spirit lips each chalice ever fills 

now , mark you , libeler , this course if you 
 dare to maintain , or rather to renew 
 if one short year 's immunity has made 
 you blink again the perils of your trade 
 the ghastly sequence of the maddened “ knave 
 the hot encounter and the colder grave 
 if the grim , dismal lesson you ignore 
 while yet the stains are fresh upon your floor 
 and calmly march upon the fatal brink 
 with eyes averted to your trail of ink

 who pull , to hold you back , your stupid nose 
 the day for you to die is not so far 
 or , at the least , to live the thing you are 

his fancy paints their distant paths so gay 
 that childish fortitude awhile gives way 
 he feels his dreadful loss — yet short the pain

 pond'ring how best his moments to employ 
 he sings his little songs of nameless joy 
 creeps on the warm green turf for many an hour 
 and plucks by chance the white and yellow flow'r 
 smoothing their stems , while resting on his knees 
 he binds a nosegay which he never sees 
 along the homeward path then feels his way 
 lifting his brow against the shining day 
 and , with a playful rapture round his eyes 
 presents a sighing parent with the prize

 faithless am i save to love 's self alone 
 were you not lovely i would leave you now 
 after the feet of beauty fly my own 
 were you not still my hunger 's rarest food 
 and water ever to my wildest thirst 
 i would desert you — think not but i would

 and all your charms more changeful than the tide 
 wherefore to be inconstant is no care 
 i have but to continue at your side 
 so wanton , light and false , my love , are you 
 i am most faithless when i most am true 

beauty ( they called her ) was n't a maid 
 of many things in the world afraid 
 she was n't a maid who turned and fled

 she was n't a maid a man could “ shoo 
 by shouting , however abruptly , “ boo

 and commonly got , the most of the bird

this is the golden book of spirit and sense 
 the holy writ of beauty ; he that wrought 
 made it with dreams and faultless words and thought 
 that seeks and finds and loses in the dense 
 dim air of life that beauty 's excellence 
 wherewith love makes one hour of life distraught 
 and all hours after follow and find not aught 
 here is that height of all love 's eminence 
 where man may breathe but for a breathing space 
 and feel his soul burn as an altar fire 
 to the unknown god of unachieved desire 
 and from the middle mystery of the place 
 watch lights that break , hear sounds as of a quire 
 but see not twice unveiled the veiled god 's face

 she opens not the womb of time , but yours 
 oft has her hands the hapless marian wrung 
 marian , whom gay in sweetest strains has sung 
 the parson 's maid — sore cause had she to rue 
 the gipsy 's tongue ; the parson 's daughter too 
 long had that anxious daughter sighed to know 
 what vellum 's sprucy clerk , the valley 's beau 
 meant by those glances which at church he stole 
 her father nodding to the psalm 's slow drawl 
 long had she sighed ; at length a prophet came 
 by many a sure prediction known to fame

 and so content me that her frowns should be

 while i did for a better state prepare 
 then i 'd not be with any trouble vexed 
 nor have the evening of my days perplexed 
 but by a silent and a peaceful death 
 without a sigh , resign my aged breath 
 and , when committed to the dust , i 'd have 
 few tears , but friendly , dropped into my grave

impetuous steams in spiral colums rise 
 through rifted rocks , impatient for the skies

 the shipwreck of my ill advised youth 
 let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn 
 without the torments of the night 's untruth

 to model forth the passions of to morrow 
 never let the rising sun prove you liars 
 to add more grief , to aggravate my sorrow 
 still let me sleep , embracing clouds in vain 
 and never wake to feel the day 's disdain 

o ye who loved our grandmothers of yore 
 fitzpatrick , sheridan , and many more 
 and thou , my prince ! whose sovereign taste and will 
 it is to love the lovely beldames still 
 thou ghost of queensbury ! whose judging sprite 
 satan may spare to peep a single night 
 pronounce — if ever in your days of bliss 
 asmodeus struck so bright a stroke as this 
 to teach the young ideas how to rise 
 flush in the cheek , and languish in the eyes 
 rush to the heart , and lighten through the frame 
 with half told wish and ill dissembled flame 
 for prurient nature still will storm the breast 
 who , tempted thus , can answer for the rest 

‘ dear native brook ! wild streamlet of the west 
 how many various fated years have passed 
 what blissful and what anguished hours , since last 
 i skimmed the smooth thin stone along thy breast 
 numbering its light leaps ! yet so deep imprest 
 sink the sweet scenes of childhood , that mine eyes 
 i never shut amid the sunny haze 
 but straight with all their tints , thy waters rise 
 thy crowning plank , thy margin 's willowy maze 
 and bedded sand that veined with various dyes 
 gleamed through thy bright transparence to the gaze 
 visions of childhood ! oft have ye beguiled 
 lone manhood 's cares , yet waking fondest sighs 
 ah ! that once more i were a careless child 

i shall forget you presently , my dear 
 so make the most of this , your little day 
 your little month , your little half a year 
 ere i forget , or die , or move away 
 and we are done forever ; by and by 
 i shall forget you , as i said , but now 
 if you entreat me with your loveliest lie 
 i will protest you with my favorite vow 
 i would indeed that love were longer lived 
 and oaths were not so brittle as they are 
 but so it is , and nature has contrived 
 to struggle on without a break thus far 
 whether or not we find what we are seeking 
 is idle , biologically speaking 

you 've money ; learning is beyond your scope 
 deaf to your envy , stubborn to your hope 
 but if upon your undeserving head 
 science and letters had their glory shed 
 if in the cavern of your skull the light 
 of knowledge shone where now eternal night 
 breeds the blind , poddy , vapor fatted naughts 
 of cerebration that you think are thoughts 
 black bats in cold and dismal corners hung 
 that squeak and gibber when you move your tongue 
 you would not write , in avarice 's defense 
 a senseless eulogy on lack of sense 
 nor show your eagerness to sacrifice 
 all noble virtues to one loathsome vice 

“ the prophet bless 'd the parting crew , and last

 for that before is all forbidden ground

if i leave all for thee , wilt thou exchange 
 and be all to me ? shall i never miss 
 home talk and blessing and the common kiss 
 that comes to each in turn , nor count it strange

 of walls and floors , another home than this

 filled by dead eyes too tender to know change

 to conquer grief , tries more , as all things prove

 the domes , the towers , the mountains and the shore 
 that gird or guard thee , venice : cold and black 
 seems now the face we loved as he of yore 
 we have given thee love — no stint , no stay , no lack 
 what gift , what gift is this thou hast given us back 

love is my sin , and thy dear virtue hate 
 hate of my sin , grounded on sinful loving 
 o but with mine , compare thou thine own state 
 and thou shalt find it merits not reproving 
 or if it do , not from those lips of thine 
 that have profaned their scarlet ornaments 
 and sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine

 thy pity may deserve to pitied be

from beauteous windsor 's high and storied halls 
 where edward 's chiefs start from the glowing walls 
 to my low cot , from ivory beds of state 
 pleased i return , unenvious of the great 
 so the bee ranges o'er the varied scenes 
 of corn , of heaths , of fallows , and of greens 
 pervades the thicket , soars above the hill 
 or murmurs to the meadow 's murmuring rill 
 now haunts old hollowed oaks , deserted cells 
 now seeks the low vale lily 's silver bells 
 sips the warm fragrance of the greenhouse bowers 
 and tastes the myrtle and the citron flowers 
 at length returning to the wonted comb 
 prefers to all his little straw built home

 till on thine idle armor lie the late

 reminds thee ; then , in subtle mockery 
 thou smilest at the window where i wait 
 who bade thee ride for life . in empty state 
 my days go on , while false hours prophesy 
 thy quick return ; at last , in sad despair 
 i cease to bid thee , leave thee free as air

i wish i could remember that first day 
 first hour , first moment of your meeting me 
 if bright or dim the season , it might be 
 summer or winter for aught i can say 
 so unrecorded did it slip away 
 so blind was i to see and to foresee 
 so dull to mark the budding of my tree 
 that would not blossom yet for many a may 
 if only i could recollect it , such 
 a day of days ! i let it come and go 
 as traceless as a thaw of bygone snow 
 it seemed to mean so little , meant so much 
 if only now i could recall that touch 
 first touch of hand in hand — did one but know 

“ o plant ! from whence i spring ! rever 'd and lov 'd 
 who soar'st so high a pitch , thou seest as clear 
 as earthly thought determines two obtuse 
 in one triangle not contain 'd , so clear 
 dost see contingencies , ere in themselves 
 existent , looking at the point whereto 
 all times are present , i , the whilst i scal 'd 
 with virgil the soul purifying mount 
 and visited the nether world of woe

 were satisfied to know the lot awaits me 
 the arrow , seen beforehand , slacks its flight 

the permutation could not well be made 
 but scandal would such practices upbraid 
 in country villages each step is seen 
 thus , round the whisper went of what had been 
 and placed at length the thorn where all was ease 
 the pow'rs divine alone it could displease 
 ‘ twas pleasant them together to behold 
 the wives , in emulation , were not cold 
 in easy talk they 'd to each other say 
 how pleasing to exchange from day to day

 for once we 've something new , and valets truck 
 this last , if made , the secret had respect 
 the other had at first a good effect 

two days had passed , when came a youthful friend 
 fair nancy with her often would unbend 
 howe'er , so very thoughtful alice seemed 
 that nancy ( who was penetrating deemed 
 was well convinced whatever alice sought 
 so very absent she was not for naught 
 in questioning she managed with such art 
 that soon she learned — what alice could impart 
 to listen she was thoroughly disposed 
 while t'other ev'ry circumstance disclosed 
 from first to last , each point and mystick hit 
 and e'en the largeness of the friar 's wit 
 the repetitions , and the wondrous skill 
 with which he managed ev'ry thing at will 

and gawayne rubbed his arms , his chest he beat 
 then grasped the battle axe and braced his feet 
 and swung the ponderous weapon high in air 
 and brought it down like lightning , fair and square 
 upon the stranger 's neck . the axe flashed through 
 cutting the green knight cleanly right in two 
 and split the hard stone floor like kindling wood 
 the head dropped off ; out gushed the thick , hot blood 
 like — i can n't find the simile i want 
 but let us say a flood of cr ê me de menthe 
 and then the warriors standing round about 
 sent up from fifty throats a mighty shout 
 as when o'er bloodhyppphensprent fields the long cheers roll 
 cacophonous , for him who kicks a goal 

not for less love , all glorious france , to thee 
 “ sweet enemy ” called in days long since at end 
 now found and hailed of england sweeter friend 
 bright sister of our freedom now , being free 
 not for less love or faith in friendship we 
 whose love burnt ever toward thee reprehend 
 the vile vain greed whose pursy dreams portend 
 between our shores suppression of the sea 
 not by dull toil of blind mechanic art 
 shall these be linked for no man 's force to part 
 nor length of years and changes to divide 
 but union only of trust and loving heart 
 and perfect faith in freedom strong to abide 
 and spirit at one with spirit on either side 

on th ’ other side the greeks in silence mov 'd 
 breathing firm courage , bent on mutual aid 
 as when the south wind o'er the mountain tops 
 spreads a thick veil of mist , the shepherd 's bane 
 and friendly to the nightly thief alone 
 that a stone 's throw the range of vision bounds 
 so rose the dust cloud , as in serried ranks 
 with rapid step they mov 'd across the plain 
 but when th ’ opposing forces near were met 
 a panther 's skin across his shoulders flung 
 arm 'd with his bow and sword , in front of all 
 advanc 'd the godlike paris ; in his hand 
 he pois 'd two brass tipp 'd jav'lins , and defied 
 to mortal combat all the chiefs of greece 

think not , because i wonder where you fled 
 that i would lift a pin to see you there 
 you may , for me , be prowling anywhere 
 so long as you show not your little head 
 no dark and evil story of the dead 
 would leave you less pernicious or less fair 
 not even lilith , with her famous hair 
 and lilith was the devil , i have read 
 i cannot hate you , for i loved you then 
 the woods were golden then . there was a road 
 through beeches ; and i said their smooth feet showed 
 like yours . truth must have heard me from afar 
 for i shall never have to learn again 
 that yours are cloven as no beech 's are 

look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest 
 now is the time that face should form another 
 whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest 
 thou dost beguile the world , unbless some mother 
 for where is she so fair whose uneared womb 
 disdains the tillage of thy husbandry 
 or who is he so fond will be the tomb 
 of his self love to stop posterity 
 thou art thy mother 's glass and she in thee 
 calls back the lovely april of her prime 
 so thou through windows of thine age shalt see 
 despite of wrinkles this thy golden time 
 but if thou live remembered not to be 
 die single and thine image dies with thee 

ah me ! and i am now the man whose muse 
 in happier times was wont to laugh at love 
 and those who suffer 'd that blind boy abuse 
 the noble gifts were given them from above 
 what metamorphose strange is this i prove i 
 myself now scarce i find myself to be 
 and think no fable circe 's tyranny 
 and all the tales are told of changed jove 
 virtue hath taught with her philosophy 
 my mind into a better course to move 
 reason may chide her fill , and oft reprove 
 affection 's power , but what is that to me 
 who ever think , and never think on ought 
 but that bright cherubim which thralls my thought 

she back four paces drew , at first , through shame 
 then , led by love , eight others forward came 
 but scruples still arose that ardour foiled 
 and nearly ey'ry thing had truly spoiled 
 anne had a conscience pure as holy fire 
 but how could she abstain from soft desire 
 if , in the bosom chance a flame should raise 
 is there a pow'r can then subdue the blaze 
 at first these inclinations she withstood 
 but doubting soon , how those of flesh and blood 
 could sins commit by stepping in advance 
 she took her seat upon the green expanse 
 and there attentively the lad observed 
 with eyes that scarcely from him ever swerved 

take of the first fruits , father , of thy care 
 wrapped in the fresh leaves of my gratitude 
 late waked for early gifts ill understood 
 claiming in all my harvests rightful share 
 whether with song that mounts the joyful air 
 i praise my god , or , in yet deeper mood 
 sit dumb because i know a speechless good 
 needing no voice , but all the soul for prayer 
 thou hast been faithful to my highest need 
 and i , thy debtor , ever , evermore 
 shall never feel the grateful burden sore 
 yet most i thank thee , not for any deed 
 but for the sense thy living self did breed 
 of fatherhood still at the great world 's core 

howbeit i know not whether as he slept 
 a voice from out the depth of dream upleapt 
 and whispered in his ear ; or whether he 
 grew to the knowledge blindly , as a tree 
 waxes from bloom to fruitage , knowing not 
 the manner of its growth : but this i wot 
 that rising from that sleep beside the spring 
 the prince had knowledge of a certain thing 
 whereof he had not wist until that hour 
 to wit , that two contending spirits had power 
 over his spirit , ruling him with sway 
 altern ; as ‘ twere dominion now of day 
 and now of dark ; for one was of the light 
 and one was of the blackness of the night 

science ! true daughter of old time thou art 
 who alterest all things with thy peering eyes 
 why preyest thou thus upon the poet 's heart 
 vulture , whose wings are dull realities 
 how should he love thee ? or how deem thee wise 
 who wouldst not leave him in his wandering 
 to seek for treasure in the jewelled skies 
 albeit he soared with an undaunted wing 
 hast thou not dragged diana from her car 
 and driven the hamadryad from the wood 
 to seek a shelter in some happier star 
 hast thou not torn the naiad from her flood 
 the elfin from the green grass , and from me 
 the summer dream beneath the tamarind tree 

no sooner on my vision streaming , smote 
 the heav'nly influence , which years past , and e'en 
 in childhood , thrill 'd me , than towards virgil i 
 turn 'd me to leftward , panting , like a babe 
 that flees for refuge to his mother 's breast 
 if aught have terrified or work 'd him woe 
 and would have cried : “ there is no dram of blood 
 that doth not quiver in me . the old flame 
 throws out clear tokens of reviving fire 
 but virgil had bereav 'd us of himself

 to whom i gave me up for safety : nor

the cat runs races with her tail . the dog 
 leaps oer the orchard hedge and knarls the grass 
 the swine run round and grunt and play with straw 
 snatching out hasty mouthfuls from the stack 
 sudden upon the elmtree tops the crow 
 unceremonious visit pays and croaks 
 then swops away . from mossy barn the owl 
 bobs hasty out — wheels round and , scared as soon 
 as hastily retires . the ducks grow wild 
 and from the muddy pond fly up and wheel 
 a circle round the village and soon , tired

 snatch from the orchard hedge the mizzled clothes 
 and laughing hurry in to keep them dry 

was time not harsh to you , or was he kind 
 o pale erinna of the perfect lyre 
 that he has left no word of singing fire 
 whereby you waked the dreaming lesbian wind 
 and kindled night along the lyric shore 
 o girl whose lips erato stooped to kiss 
 do you go sorrowing because of this 
 in fields where poets sing forevermore 
 or are you glad and is it best to be 
 a silent music men have never heard 
 a dream in all our souls that we may say 
 “ her voice had all the rapture of the sea 
 and all the clear cool quiver of a bird 
 deep in a forest at the break of day 

“ there were but two , and we were forty ! yet 
 the captain wrote , “ that dauntless couple throve 
 and faced our wildering faces ; and i said 
 ‘ lie to awhile ! ’ i did not choose to let 
 a strife go on of little worth to us 
 and so unequal ! but the dying tread 
 of flying kinsmen moved them not : for wet 
 with surf and wild with streaks of white and black 
 the pair remained . ” — o stout caractacus 
 ‘ twas thus you stood when caesar 's legions strove 
 to beat their few , fantastic foemen back 
 your patriots with their savage stripes of red 
 to drench the stormy cliff and moaning cove 
 with faithful blood , as pure as any ever shed 

false hope prolongs my ever certain grief 
 traitor to me , and faithful to my love 
 a thousand times it promised me relief 
 yet never any true effect i prove 
 oft when i find in her no truth at all 
 i banish her , and blame her treachery 
 yet soon again i must her back recall 
 as one that dies without her company 
 thus often , as i chase my hope from me 
 straightway she hastes her unto delia 's eyes 
 fed with some pleasing look , there shall she be 
 and so sent back . and thus my fortune lies 
 looks feed my hope , hope fosters me in vain 
 hopes are unsure when certain is my pain 

he finish 'd ; and , one soul inspiring all 
 form 'd in a wedge , the foot approach the wall 
 without the town , an unprovided train 
 of gaping , gazing citizens are slain 
 some firebrands , others scaling ladders bear 
 and those they toss aloft , and these they rear 
 the flames now launch 'd , the feather 'd arrows fly 
 and clouds of missive arms obscure the sky 
 advancing to the front , the hero stands 
 and , stretching out to heav'n his pious hands 
 attests the gods , asserts his innocence 
 upbraids with breach of faith th ’ ausonian prince 
 declares the royal honor doubly stain 'd 
 and twice the rites of holy peace profan 'd 

high deeds , o germans , are to come from you 
 thus in your books the record shall be found 
 “ a watchword was pronounced , a potent sound 
 arminius !— all the people quaked like dew 
 stirr 'd by the breeze — they rose , a nation , true 
 true to itself — the mighty germany 
 she of the danube and the northern sea 
 she rose ,— and off at once the yoke she threw 
 all power was given her in the dreadful trance 
 those new born kings she wither 'd like a flame 
 — woe to them all ! but heaviest woe and shame 
 to that bavarian , who did first advance 
 his banner in accursed league with france 
 first open traitor to her sacred name 

the elect angels and the souls in bliss 
 the citizens of heaven , when , that first day 
 my lady passed from me and went their way 
 of marvel and pity full , did round her press 
 “ what light is this , and what new loveliness 
 they said among them ; “ for such sweet display 
 did never mount , that from the earth did stray 
 to this high dwelling , all this age , we guess 
 she , well content her lodging chang 'd to find 
 shows perfect , by her peers most perfect placed 
 and now and then half turning looks behind 
 to see if i walk in the way she traced 
 hence i lift heavenward all my heart and mind 
 because i hear her pray me to make haste 

“ this circuit , ” said my teacher , “ knots the scourge 
 for envy , and the cords are therefore drawn 
 by charity 's correcting hand . the curb 
 is of a harsher sound , as thou shalt hear 
 ( if i deem rightly ) , ere thou reach the pass 
 where pardon sets them free . but fix thine eyes 
 intently through the air , and thou shalt see 
 a multitude before thee seated , each 
 along the shelving grot . ” then more than erst 
 i op 'd my eyes , before me view 'd , and saw 
 shadows with garments dark as was the rock 
 and when we pass 'd a little forth , i heard 
 a crying , “ blessed mary ! pray for us 
 michael and peter ! all ye saintly host 

who lives enthralled to cupid and his flame 
 from day to day is changed in sundry sort 
 the proof whereof myself may well report 
 who oft transformed by him may teach the same 
 i first was turned into a wounded hart 
 that bare the bloody arrow in my side 
 then to a swan that midst the waters glide 
 with piteous voice presaged my deadly smart 
 eftsoons i waxed a faint and fading flower 
 then was i made a fountain sudden dry 
 distilling all my tears from troubled eye 
 now am i salamander by his power 
 living in flames , but hope ere long to be 
 a voice , to talk my mistress ’ majesty 

peter , when thou this pleasant world dost see 
 believe , thou seest mere dreams and vanity 
 not real things , but false , and through the air 
 each where an empty , slipp'ry scene , though fair 
 the chirping birds , the fresh woods ’ shady boughs 
 the leaves ’ shrill whispers , when the west wind blows 
 the swift , fierce greyhounds coursing on the plains 
 the flying hare , distress 'd ‘ twixt fear and pains 
 the bloomy maid decking with flow'rs her head 
 the gladsome , easy youth by light love led 
 and whatsoe'er here with admiring eyes 
 thou seem'st to see , ‘ tis but a frail disguise 
 worn by eternal things , a passive dress 
 put on by beings that are passiveless 

alaciel 's story 's of another kind 
 and i 've a little altered it , you 'll find 
 faults some may see , and others disbelieve 
 ‘ tis all the same :— ‘ twill never make me grieve 
 alaciel 's mem'ry , it is very clear 
 can scarcely by it lose ; there 's naught to fear 
 two facts important i have kept in view 
 in which the author fully i pursue 
 the one — no less than eight the belle possessed 
 before a husband 's sight her eyes had blessed 
 the other is , the prince she was to wed 
 ne'er seemed to heed this trespass on his bed 
 but thought , perhaps , the beauty she had got 
 would prove to any one a happy lot 

when my love swears that she is made of truth 
 i do believe her though i know she lies 
 that she might think me some untutored youth 
 unlearned in the world 's false subtleties 
 thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young 
 although she knows my days are past the best 
 simply i credit her false speaking tongue 
 on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed 
 but wherefore says she not she is unjust 
 and wherefore say not i that i am old 
 o love 's best habit is in seeming trust 
 and age in love , loves not to have years told 
 therefore i lie with her , and she with me 
 and in our faults by lies we flattered be 

passing i saw her as she stood beside 
 a lonely stream between two barren wolds 
 her loose vest hung in rudely gathered folds 
 on her swart bosom , which in maiden pride 
 pillowed a string of pearls ; among her hair 
 twined the light bluebell and the stone crop gay 
 and not far thence the small encampment lay 
 curling its wreathed smoke into the air 
 she seemed a child of some sun favored clime 
 so still , so habited to warmth and rest 
 and in my wayward musings on past time 
 when my thought fills with treasured memories 
 that image nearest borders on the blest 
 creations of pure art that never dies 

if thou hadst been a painter , what fresh looks 
 what outbursts of pent glories , what new grace 
 had shone upon us from the great world 's face 
 how had we read , as in eternal books 
 the love of god in loneliest shiest nooks 
 a lily , in merest lines thy hand did trace 
 had plainly been god 's child of lower race 
 and oh how strong the hills , songful the brooks 
 to thee all nature 's meanings lie light bare 
 because thy heart is nature 's inner side 
 clear as , to us , earth on the dawn 's gold tide 
 her notion vast up in thy soul did rise 
 thine is the world , thine all its splendours rare 
 thou man ideal , with the unsleeping eyes 

“ smooth roll 'd my vernal years , while on my head 
 fate 's early smiles a meteor lustre shed 
 no painful fear , no troubles , then had power 
 to break the current of one peaceful hour 
 oft as i trod the meadow 's verdant round 
 or pierced the echoing forest 's gloomy bound 
 or traced the willowy margin of the stream 
 lost in the wildering maze of fancy 's dream 
 before me life 's long years in prospect rose 
 by fears unbroken , undisturb 'd by woes 
 yes ! i remember well ,— my dizzy brain 
 feels those bright hours not yet effaced by pain 
 still on my soul they cast a distant light 
 and gild with transitory gleams the night 

and why shou 'd not a man adore his wife 
 since she 's the only comfort of his life 
 a gift presented by the gods above 
 a lively emblem of the charms of love 
 all o 're divine , a heaven , here below 
 man 's paradice , where joys in plenty flow 
 no shame , but honour does bless 'd wedlock crown 
 and ushers in both glory and renown 
 sweet pretty babes , the product of each charm 
 in marriage bed protects us from all harm 
 their innocence like lambs and doves appear 
 which make our hearts and minds quite void of care 
 no sorrow can lay hold of man or wife 
 where love and virtue is the rule of life 

i am so weary with the burden old 
 of foregone faults , and power of custom base 
 that much i fear to perish from the ways 
 and fall into my enemy 's grim fold 
 true , a high friend , to free me , not with gold 
 came , of ineffable and utmost grace 
 then straightway vanished from before my face 
 so that in vain i strive him to behold 
 but his voice yet comes echoing below 
 o ye that labour , the way open lies 
 come unto me lest some one shut the gate 
 — what heavenly grace — what love will — or what fate 
 the pinions of a dove on me bestow 
 that i may rest , and from the earth arise 

mary , since first i knew thee , to this hour 
 my love hath deepened , with my wiser sense 
 of what in woman is to reverence 
 thy clear heart , fresh as e'er was forest flower 
 still opens more to me its beauteous dower 
 but let praise hush ,— love asks no evidence 
 to prove itself well placed : we know not whence 
 it gleans the straws that thatch its humble bower 
 we can but say we found it in the heart 
 spring of all sweetest thoughts , arch foe of blame 
 sower of flowers in the dusty mart 
 pure vestal of the poet 's holy flame 
 this is enough , and we have done our part 
 if we but keep it spotless as it came 

when to the garden of untroubled thought 
 i came of late , and saw the open door 
 and wished again to enter , and explore 
 the sweet , wild ways with stainless bloom inwrought 
 and bowers of innocence with beauty fraught 
 it seemed some purer voice must speak before 
 i dared to tread that garden loved of yore 
 that eden lost unknown and found unsought 
 then just within the gate i saw a child 
 a stranger child , yet to my heart most dear 
 who held his hands to me and softly smiled 
 with eyes that knew no shade of sin or fear 
 “ come in , ” he said , “ and play awhile with me 
 i am the little child you used to be 

the husband , while the holy pastor spoke 
 appeared to grumble and his stars invoke 
 the wife was in a rage , and ‘ gan to scold 
 said she to peter , wretch that i behold 
 thou'lt be through life a prey to pain and grief 
 come not to me and bray and hope relief 
 the worthy pastor would have us procured 
 the means that might much comfort have ensured 
 can he deserve such treatment to receive 
 good mister john this goose i now would leave 
 and ev'ry morning , while he gathers fruits 
 or plants , herbs , cabbages , and various roots 
 without averting him , pray , here repair 
 you 'll soon transform me to a charming mare 

so drives self love , through just and through unjust 
 to one man 's power , ambition , lucre , lust 
 the same self love , in all , becomes the cause 
 of what restrains him , government and laws 
 for , what one likes , if others like as well 
 what serves one will , when many wills rebel 
 how shall he keep what , sleeping or awake 
 a weaker may surprise , a stronger take 
 his safety must his liberty restrain 
 all join to guard what each desires to gain 
 forced into virtue thus by self defence 
 even kings learn 'd justice and benevolence 
 self love forsook the path it first pursued 
 and found the private in the public good 

few words they said ; the balmy odorous wind 
 wandered about , some resting place to find 
 the young leaves rustled ‘ neath its gentle breath 
 and here and there some blossom burst his sheath 
 adding unnoticed fragrance to the night 
 but , as they pondered , a new golden light 
 streamed over the green garden , and they heard 
 sweet voices sing some ancient poet 's word 
 in praise of may , and then in sight there came 
 the minstrels ’ figures underneath the flame 
 of scented torches passing ‘ twixt the trees 
 and soon the dusky hall grew bright with these 
 and therewithal they put all thought away 
 and midst the tinkling harps drank deep to may 

let not the mitre england 's prelate wears 
 next to the crown whose regal pomp it shares 
 though low before it courtly christians bow 
 leave its red mark on younger england 's brow 
 we love , we honor , the maternal dame 
 but let her priesthood wear a modest name 
 while through the waters of the pilgrim 's bay 
 a new born mayflower shows her keels the way 
 too old grew britain for her mother 's beads 
 must we be necklaced with her children 's creeds 
 welcome alike in surplice or in gown 
 the loyal lieges of the heavenly crown 
 we greet with cheerful , not submissive , mien 
 a sister church , but not a mitred queen 

and oh ! if a blissful communion with heaven 
 to earth wearied spirits has ever been given 
 if the loved and the distant , the lost and the dead 
 who smiled on our pathway a moment , and fled 
 who darkened our sunshine and saddened our mirth 
 to prove that the soul has no home upon earth 
 are sent in the night time of gloom and distress 
 as heralds of mercy to comfort and bless 
 to place , while the tempest is fearfully loud 
 the bright bow of peace on the dark thundercloud 
 to whisper of purer and holier ties 
 of a land where the blossom of joy never dies 
 such tidings to welcome , oh ! where shall we flee 
 if not , dearest woodburn , to silence and thee 

arise , o master artist of the age 
 and paint the picture which at once shall be 
 immortal art and bless 'd prophecy 
 the bruised vision of the world assuage 
 to earth 's dark book add one illumined page 
 so scintillant with truth , that all who see 
 shall break from superstition and stand free 
 now let this wondrous work thy hand engage 
 the mortal sorrow of the nazarene 
 too long has been faith 's symbol and its sign 
 too long a dying saviour has sufficed 
 give us the glowing emblem which shall mean 
 mankind awakened to the self divine 
 the living emblem of the radiant christ 

to whom the queen ( whilst yet in pensive mind 
 was in the silent gates of sleep confined 
 “ o sister to my soul forever dear 
 why this first visit to reprove my fear 
 how in a realm so distant should you know 
 from what deep source ceaseless sorrows flow 
 to all my hope my royal lord is lost 
 his country 's buckler , and the grecian boast 
 and with consummate woe to weigh me down 
 the heir of all his honours and his crown 
 my darling son is fled ! an easy prey 
 to the fierce storms , or men more fierce than they 
 who , in a league of blood associates sworn 
 will intercept the unwary youth 's return 

god give us men ! a time like this demands 
 strong minds , great hearts , true faith , and ready hands 
 men whom the lust of office does not kill 
 men whom the spoils of office cannot buy 
 men who possess opinions and a will 
 men who have honor — men who will not lie 
 men who can stand before a demagogue 
 and damn his treacherous flatteries without winking 
 tall men , sun crowned , who live above the fog 
 in public duty and in private thinking 
 for while the rabble , with their thumb worn creeds 
 their large professions and their little deeds 
 mingle in selfish strife , lo ! freedom weeps 
 wrong rules the land , and waiting justice sleeps 

in wiser days , my darling rosebud , blown 
 to beauty proud as was your mother 's prime 
 in that desired , delayed , incredible time 
 you 'll ask why i abandoned you , my own 
 and the dear heart that was your baby throne 
 to dice with death . and oh ! they 'll give you rhyme 
 and reason : some will call the thing sublime 
 and some decry it in a knowing tone 
 so here , while the mad guns curse overhead 
 and tired men sigh with mud for couch and floor 
 know that we fools , now with the foolish dead 
 died not for flag , nor king , nor emperor 
 but for a dream , born in a herdsman 's shed 
 and for the secret scripture of the poor 

achilles speeds from tent to tent , and warms 
 his hardy myrmidons to blood and arms 
 all breathing death , around the chief they stand 
 a grim , terrific , formidable band 
 grim as voracious wolves , that seek the springs 
 when scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings 
 when some tall stag , fresh slaughtered in the wood 
 has drench ’ d their wide insatiate throats with blood 
 to the black fount they rush , a hideous throng 
 with paunch distended , and with lolling tongue 
 fire fills their eye , their black jaws belch the gore 
 and gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more 
 like furious , rush ’ d the myrmidonian crew 
 such their dread strength , and such their deathful view 

to whom the godlike paris thus replied 
 “ hector , since blameless i incur thy blame 
 ne'er have i less withdrawn me from the fight 
 and me not wholly vile my mother bore 
 for since thou gav'st command to attack the ships 
 we here against the greeks unflinching war 
 have wag 'd ; our comrades , whom thou seek'st , are slain 
 only deiphobus hath left the field 
 and helenus ; both wounded by the spear 
 both through the hand ; but jove their life hath spar 'd 
 but thou , where'er thy courage bids , lead on 
 we shall be prompt to follow ; to our pow'r 
 thou shalt in us no lack of valour find 
 beyond his pow'r the bravest cannot fight 

already , if my mem'ry do not fail 
 i 've said , the youth 's estates were put to sale 
 to pay for feasts the fair to entertain 
 and what he 'd left was only one domain 
 a petty farm to which he now retired 
 ashamed to show where once so much admired 
 and wretched too , a prey to lorn despair 
 unable to obtain by splendid care 
 a beauty he 'd pursued six years and more 
 and should for ever fervently adore 
 his want of merit was the cause he thought 
 that she could never to his wish be brought 
 while from him not a syllable was heard 
 against the lovely belle his soul preferred 

but i have seen pictures the work of man 
 in which at first appeared but chaos wild 
 so high the art transcended , they beguiled 
 the eye as formless , and without a plan 
 not soon , the spirit , brooding o'er , began 
 to see a purpose rise , like mountain isled 
 when god said , let the dry appear ! and , piled 
 above the waves , it rose in twilight wan 
 so might thy pictures then have been too strange 
 for us to pierce beyond their outmost look 
 a vapour and a darkness ; a sealed book 
 an atmosphere too high for wings to range 
 and so we could but , gazing , pale and change 
 and tremble as at a void thought cannot brook 

they knelt in silent anguish by her bed 
 and could not weep ; but calmly there she lay 
 all pain had left her ; and the sun 's last ray 
 shone through upon her , warming into red 
 the shady curtains . in her heart she said 
 “ heaven opens ; i leave these and go away 
 the bridegroom calls ,— shall the bride seek to stay 
 then low upon her breast she bowed her head 
 o lily flower , o gem of priceless worth 
 o dove with patient voice and patient eyes 
 o fruitful vine amid a land of dearth 
 o maid replete with loving purities 
 thou bowedst down thy head with friends on earth 
 to raise it with the saints in paradise 

those who have tact their poverty to mask 
 before their chief get more than those who ask 
 it makes , you see , a difference , if you take 
 as modest people do , or snatch your cake 
 yet that 's the point from which our question starts 
 by what way best to get at patrons ’ hearts 
 “ my mother 's poor , my sister 's dower is due 
 my farm wo n't sell or yield us corn enow 
 what is all this but just the beggar 's cry 
 “ i 'm starving ; give me food for charity 
 “ ah ! ” whines another in a minor key 
 “ the loaf 's in out ; pray spare a slice for me 
 but if in peace the raven would have fed 
 he 'd have had less of clawing , more of bread 

she clapped her hands , and through the gallery pour 
 equipped for flight , her vassals — greek and moor 
 silent but quick they stoop , his chains unbind 
 once more his limbs are free as mountain wind 
 but on his heavy heart such sadness sate 
 as if they there transferred that iron weight 
 no words are uttered — at her sign , a door 
 reveals the secret passage to the shore 
 the city lies behind — they speed , they reach 
 the glad waves dancing on the yellow beach 
 and conrad following , at her beck , obeyed 
 nor cared he now if rescued or betrayed 
 resistance were as useless as if seyd 
 yet lived to view the doom his ire decreed 

the sea was sapphire coloured , and the sky 
 burned like a heated opal through the air 
 we hoisted sail ; the wind was blowing fair 
 for the blue lands that to the eastward lie 
 from the steep prow i marked with quickening eye 
 zakynthos , every olive grove and creek 
 ithaca 's cliff , lycaon 's snowy peak 
 and all the flower strewn hills of arcady 
 the flapping of the sail against the mast 
 the ripple of the water on the side 
 the ripple of girls ’ laughter at the stern 
 the only sounds : when ‘ gan the west to burn 
 and a red sun upon the seas to ride 
 i stood upon the soil of greece at last 

or i shall live your epitaph to make 
 or you survive when i in earth am rotten 
 from hence your memory death cannot take 
 although in me each part will be forgotten 
 your name from hence immortal life shall have 
 though i ( once gone ) to all the world must die 
 the earth can yield me but a common grave 
 when you entombed in men 's eyes shall lie 
 your monument shall be my gentle verse 
 which eyes not yet created shall o'erhyppphenread 
 and tongues to be , your being shall rehearse 
 when all the breathers of this world are dead 
 you still shall live ( such virtue hath my pen 
 where breath most breathes , even in the mouths of men 

i watched them long in my curious dream 
 till they stood by the border of the stream 
 then , just as i thought , the two ways met 
 but all the brethren were talking yet 
 and would talk on , till the heaving tide 
 carried them over , side by side 
 side by side , for the way was one 
 the toilsome journey of life was done 
 and priest and quaker , and all who died 
 came out alike on the other side 
 no forms or crosses , or books had they 
 no gowns of silk , or suits of gray 
 no creeds to guide them , or mss 
 for all had put on “ christ 's righteousness 

over the threshold of his pleasant home 
 set in green clearings passed the exiled friend 
 in simple trust , misdoubting not the end 
 “ dear heart of mine ! ” he said , “ the time has come 
 to trust the lord for shelter . ” one long gaze 
 the goodwife turned on each familiar thing 
 the lowing kine , the orchard blossoming 
 the open door that showed the hearth fire 's blaze 
 and calmly answered , “ yes , he will provide 
 silent and slow they crossed the homestead 's bound 
 lingering the longest by their child 's grave mound 
 “ move on , or stay and hang ! ” the sheriff cried 
 they left behind them more than home or land 
 and set sad faces to an alien strand 

if this be love , to draw a weary breath 
 to paint on floods till the shore cry to th'air 
 with downward looks still reading on the earth 
 these sad memorials of my love 's despair 
 if this be love , to war against my soul 
 lie down to wail , rise up to sigh and grieve 
 the never resting stone of care to roll 
 still to complain my griefs , whilst none relieve 
 if this be love , to clothe me with dark thoughts 
 haunting untrodden paths to wail apart 
 my pleasures horror , music tragic notes 
 tears in mine eyes and sorrow at my heart 
 if this be love , to live a living death 
 then do i love , and draw this weary breath 

the world has no such flower in any land 
 and no such pearl in any gulf the sea 
 as any babe on any mother 's knee 
 but all things blessed of men by saints are banned 
 god gives them grace to read and understand 
 the palimpsest of evil , writ where we 
 poor fools and lovers but of love , can see 
 nought save a blessing signed by love 's own hand 
 the smile that opens heaven on us for them 
 hath sin 's transmitted birthmark hid therein 
 the kiss it craves calls down from heaven a rod 
 if innocence be sin that gods condemn 
 praise we the men who so being born in sin 
 first dared the doom and broke the bonds of god 

safer with winds and waves than human wrath 
 with ravening wolves than those whose zeal for god 
 was cruelty to man , the exiles trod 
 drear leagues of forest without guide or path 
 or launching frail boats on the uncharted sea 
 round storm vexed capes , whose teeth of granite ground 
 the waves to foam , their perilous way they wound 
 enduring all things so their souls were free 
 oh , true confessors , shaming them who did 
 anew the wrong their pilgrim fathers bore 
 for you the mayflower spread her sail once more 
 freighted with souls , to all that duty bid 
 faithful as they who sought an unknown land 
 o'er wintry seas , from holland 's hook of sand 

i had forgotten what i had lightly said 
 and without speech , without a thought i went 
 steeped in that golden quiet , all content 
 to drink the transient beauty as it sped 
 out of eternal darkness into time 
 to light and burn and know itself a fire 
 yet doomed — ah , fate of the fulfilled desire 
 to fade , a meteor , paying for the crime 
 of living glorious in the denser air 
 of our material earth . a strange despair 
 an agony , yet strangely , subtly sweet 
 and tender as an unpassionate caress 
 filled me ... oh laughter ! youth 's conceit 
 grown almost conscious of youth 's feebleness 

on many a saddened hearth the evening fire 
 burns paler as the children 's hour draws near 
 that joyous hour his song made doubly dear 
 and tender memories touch the faltering choir 
 he sings no more on earth ; our vain desire 
 aches for the voice we loved so long to hear 
 in dorian flute notes breathing soft and clear 
 the sweet contralto that could never tire 
 deafened with listening to a harsher strain 
 the maenad 's scream , the stark barbarian 's cry 
 still for those soothing , loving tones we sigh 
 oh , for our vanished orpheus once again 
 the shadowy silence hears us call in vain 
 his lips are hushed ; his song shall never die 

beside the fruitfull shore of muddie nile 
 upon a sunnie banke outstretched lay 
 in monstrous length , a mightie crocodile 
 that , cram 'd with guiltles blood and greedie pray 
 of wretched people travailing that way 
 thought all things lesse than his disdainfull pride 
 i saw a little bird , cal 'd tedula 
 the least of thousands which on earth abide 
 that forst this hideous beast to open wide 
 the greisly gates of his devouring hell 
 and let him feede , as nature doth provide 
 upon his iawes , that with blacke venime swell 
 why then should greatest things the least disdaine 
 sith that so small so mightie can constraine 

one day the doctor found the bottle full 
 and , being thirsty , took a vigorous pull 
 put back the “ elixir ” where ‘ t was always found 
 and had old dobbin saddled and brought round 
 — you know those old time rhubarb colored nags 
 that carried doctors and their saddle bags 
 sagacious beasts ! they stopped at every place 
 where blinds were shut — knew every patient 's case 
 looked up and thought — the baby 's in a fit 
 that wo n't last long — he 'll soon be through with it 
 but shook their heads before the knockered door 
 where some old lady told the story o'er 
 whose endless stream of tribulation flows 
 for gastric griefs and peristaltic woes 

master of human destinies am i 
 fame , love and fortune on my footsteps wait 
 cities and fields i walk : i penetrate 
 deserts and fields remote , and , passing by 
 hovel and mart and palace , soon or late 
 i knock unbidden once at every gate 
 if sleeping , wake : if feasting , rise before 
 i turn away . it is the hour of fate 
 and they who follow me reach every state 
 mortals desire , and conquer every foe 
 save death ; but those who doubt or hesitate 
 condemned to failure , penury and woe 
 seek me in vain and uselessly implore 
 i answer not , and i return no more 

the train ! the twelve o'clock for paradise 
 hurry , or it will try to creep away 
 out in the country every one is wise 
 we can be only wise on saturday 
 there you are waiting , little friendly house 
 those are your chimney stacks with you between 
 surrounded by old trees and strolling cows 
 staring through all your windows at the green 
 your homely floor is creaking for our tread 
 the smiling tea pot with contented spout 
 thinks of the boiling water , and the bread 
 longs for the butter . all their hands are out 
 to greet us , and the gentle blankets seem 
 purring and crooning : ‘ lie in us , and dream 

“ was the prophecy fulfilled 
 the sullen disc of the declining sun 
 was crimson with a curse and a portent 
 and scarce his angry ray lit up the land 
 that lay below , whose lurid gloom appeared 
 freaked with a moving mist , which , reeking up 
 from dim tarns hateful with a horrid ban 
 took shapes forbidden and without a name 
 gigantic night birds , rising from the reeds 
 with cries discordant , startled all the air 
 and bodiless voices babbled in the gloom 
 but not to me came any voice again 
 and , covering my face with thin , dead hands 
 i wept , and woke , and cried aloud to god 

insult me not with tombs ! the monster cried 
 let closing clods thy coward carcase hide 
 but these brave bones , unburied on the plain 
 touch not with dust , nor dare with rites profane 
 let no curst earth conceal this gory head 
 nor songs proclaim the dreadful zamor dead 
 me , whom the hungry gods from plain to plain 
 have follow 'd , feasting on thy slaughter 'd train 
 me wouldst thou cover ? no ! from yonder sky 
 the wide beak 'd hawk , that now beholds me die 
 soon with his cowering train my flesh shall tear 
 and wolves and tigers vindicate their share 
 receive , dread powers ( since i can slay no more 
 my last glad victim , this devoved gore 

but do thy worst to steal thy self away 
 for term of life thou art assured mine 
 and life no longer than thy love will stay 
 for it depends upon that love of thine 
 then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs 
 when in the least of them my life hath end 
 i see , a better state to me belongs 
 than that , which on thy humour doth depend 
 thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind 
 since that my life on thy revolt doth lie 
 o what a happy title do i find 
 happy to have thy love , happy to die 
 but what 's so blessed fair that fears no blot 
 thou mayst be false , and yet i know it not 

resembling none , and none so poor as i 
 poor to the world , and poor in each esteem 
 whose first born loves at first obscured did die 
 and bred no fame but flame of base misdeem 
 under the ensign of whose tir è d pen 
 love 's legions forth have masked , by others masked 
 think how i live wrong è d by ill tongued men 
 not master of myself , to all wrongs tasked 
 oh thou that canst , and she that may do all things 
 support these languishing conceits that perish 
 look on their growth ; perhaps these silly small things 
 may win this wordly palm , so you do cherish 
 homer hath vowed , and i with him do vow this 
 he will and shall revive , if you allow this 

happy the first of men , ere yet confined 
 to smoky cities ; who in sheltering groves 
 warm caves , and deep sunk valleys lived and loved 
 by cares unwounded ; what the sun and showers 
 and genial earth untillaged , could produce 
 they gathered grateful , or the acorn brown 
 or blushing berry ; by the liquid lapse 
 of murmuring waters called to slake their thirst 
 or with fair nymphs their sun brown limbs to bathe 
 with nymphs who fondly clasped their favourite youths 
 unawed by shame , beneath the beechen shade 
 nor wiles nor artificial coyness knew 
 then doors and walls were not ; the melting maid 
 nor frown of parents feared , nor husband 's threats

 and over al this , if any lady bright 
 hath set hir herte on any maner wight

‘ twas but a moment , for that respect 
 which clothes all courage their voices checked 
 and something the wildest could understand 
 spake in the old man 's strong right hand 
 and his corded throat , and the lurking frown 
 of his eyebrows under his old bell crown 
 until , as they gazed , there crept an awe 
 through the ranks in whispers , and some men saw 
 in the antique vestments and long white hair 
 the past of the nation in battle there 
 and some of the soldiers since declare 
 that the gleam of his old white hat afar 
 like the crested plume of the brave navarre 
 that day was their oriflamme of war 

‘ first may the yawning earth her bosom rend 
 and let me hence to hell alive descend 
 or die the death i dread no less than hell

 ere i my fame by one lewd act disgrace 
 or once renounce the honour of my race 
 for know , sir knight , of gentle blood i came 
 i loathe a whore , and startle at the name 
 but jealous men on their own crimes reflect 
 and learn from thence their ladies to suspect 
 else why these heedless cautions , sir , to me 
 these doubts and fears of female constancy 
 this chime still rings in every lady 's ear 
 the only strain a wife must hope to hear 

i do compare unto thy youthly clear 
 which always bides within thy flow'ring prime 
 the month of april , that bedews our clime 
 with pleasant flowers , when as his showers appear 
 before thy face shall fly false cruelty 
 before his face the doly season fleets 
 mild been his looks , thine eyes are full of sweets 
 firm is his course , firm is thy loyalty 
 he paints the fields through liquid crystal showers 
 thou paint'st my verse with pallas , learn è d flowers 
 with zephirus ’ sweet , breath he fills the plains 
 and thou my heart with weeping sighs dost wring 
 his brows are dewed with morning 's crystal spring 
 thou mak'st my eyes with tears bemoan my pains 

one night , when i came home unusual late 
 too hungry and too tired to feel first rate 
 her supper struck me wrong ( though i 'll allow 
 she had n't much to strike with , anyhow 
 and when i went to milk the cows , and found 
 they 'd wandered from their usual feeding ground 
 and maybe 'd left a few long miles behind ‘ em 
 which i must copy , if i meant to find ‘ em 
 flash quick the stay chains of my temper broke 
 and in a , trice these hot words i had spoke 
 “ you ought to 've kept the animals in view 
 and drove ‘ em in ; you 'd nothing else to do 
 the heft of all our life on me must fall 
 you just lie round and let me do it all 

me doubt possess 'd , and “ speak , ” it whisper 'd me 
 “ speak , speak unto thy lady , that she quench 
 thy thirst with drops of sweetness . ” yet blank awe 
 which lords it o'er me , even at the sound 
 of beatrice 's name , did bow me down 
 as one in slumber held . not long that mood 
 beatrice suffer 'd : she , with such a smile 
 as might have made one blest amid the flames 
 beaming upon me , thus her words began 
 “ thou in thy thought art pond'ring ( as i deem 
 and what i deem is truth how just revenge 
 could be with justice punish 'd : from which doubt 
 i soon will free thee ; so thou mark my words 
 for they of weighty matter shall possess thee 

falsely doth envy of your praises blame 
 my tongue , my pen , my heart of flattery 
 because i said there was no sun but thee 
 it called my tongue the partial trump of fame 
 and saith my pen hath flatter è d thy name 
 because my pen did to my tongue agree 
 and that my heart must needs a flatterer be 
 which taught both tongue and pen to say the same 
 no , no , i flatter not when thee i call 
 the sun , sith that the sun was never such 
 but when the sun thee i compared withal 
 doubtless the sun i flatter è d too much 
 witness mine eyes , i say the truth in this 
 they have seen thee and know that so it is 

“ now through the rocks , appall 'd with deep dismay 
 we bend our course , and stem the desperate way 
 dire scylla there a scene of horror forms 
 and here charybdis fills the deep with storms 
 when the tide rushes from her rumbling caves 
 the rough rock roars , tumultuous boil the waves 
 they toss , they foam , a wild confusion raise 
 like waters bubbling o'er the fiery blaze 
 eternal mists obscure the aerial plain 
 and high above the rock she spouts the main 
 when in her gulfs the rushing sea subsides 
 she drains the ocean with the refluent tides 
 the rock re bellows with a thundering sound

o queenly month of indolent repose 
 i drink thy breath in sips of rare perfume 
 as in thy downy lap of clover bloom 
 i nestle like a drowsy child and doze 
 the lazy hours away . the zephyr throws 
 the shifting shuttle of the summer 's loom 
 and weaves a damask work of gleam and gloom 
 before thy listless feet . the lily blows 
 a bugle call of fragrance o'er the glade 
 and wheeling into ranks , with plume and spear 
 thy harvest armies gather on parade 
 while faint and far away , yet pure and clear 
 a voice calls out of alien lands of shade 
 all hail the peerless goddess of the year 

the battle quickly raged ; alike they erred 
 the pirates slaughter loved , and blood preferred 
 and , long accustomed to the stormy tide

 in numbers , too , superior they were found 
 but hisipal 's valour greatly shone around 
 and kept the combat undecided long 
 at length grifonio , wond'rous large and strong

 and many soon lay gasping by the sword

 at length , the round the noble hispal gained

 rage marked his eyes , whene'er he dealt a blow 

brave little people , of large aims , you bow 
 too often , and too low before the past 
 you sit too long in worship of the dead 
 yet have you risen , open eyed , to greet 
 the great material present . now salute 
 the greater future , blazing its bold trail 
 through old traditions . leave your dead to sleep 
 in quiet peace with god . let your concern 
 be with the living , and the yet unborn 
 bestow on them your thoughts , and waste no time 
 in costly honours to insensate dust 
 unlock the doors of usefulness , and lead 
 your lovely daughters forth to larger fields 
 away from jungles of the ancient sin 

o spring , that flutter'st the slow winter by 
 to drop thy buds before his frosty feet 
 dost thou not grieve to see thy darlings lie 
 in trodden death , and weep their beauty sweet 
 yet must thou cast thy tender offering 
 and make thy way above thy mourn è d dead 
 or frowning winter would be always king 
 and thou wouldst never walk with crown è d head 
 so gentle love must make his venturous way 
 among the shaken buds of his own pain 
 and many a hope blown garland meekly lay 
 before the chilly season of disdain 
 but as no beauty may the spring outglow

 he graced her with his sweet melodious song 
 and made her subject of his poesies 
 the warrior mars bequeathed her fierce disdain 
 venus her smile , and phoebe all her fair 
 python his voice , and ceres all her grain

 her distance from the shore , the course begun

in april 's gilded morn when south winds blow 
 and gently shake the hawthorn 's silver crown 
 wafting its scent the forest glade adown 
 the dewy shelter of the bounding doe 
 then , under trees , soft tufts of primrose show 
 their palely yellowing flowers ;— to the moist sun 
 blue harebells peep , while cowslips stand unblown 
 plighted to riper may ;— and lavish flow 
 the lark 's loud carols in the wilds of air 
 o ! not to nature 's glad enthusiast cling

contented evening ; comfortable joys 
 the snoozing fire , and all the fields are still 
 tranquil delight , no purpose , and no noise 
 unless the slow wind flowing round the hill 
 ‘ murry ’ ( the kettle ) dozes ; little mouse 
 is rambling prudently about the floor 
 there 's lovely conversation in this house 
 words become princes that were slaves before 
 what a sweet atmosphere for you and me 
 the people that have been here left behind 
 oh , but i fear it may turn out to be 
 built of a dream , erected in the mind 
 so if we speak too loud , we may awaken 
 to find it vanished , and ourselves mistaken 

the fields have faded , the groves look dead 
 the summer is gone , its beauty has fled 
 and there breathes a low and plaintive sound 
 from each stream and solemn wood around 
 in unison with their tone , my breast 
 with a spirit of kindred gloom is opprest 
 and the sighs burst forth as i gaze , the while 
 on the crumbling stone of the reverend pile 
 and list to the sounds of the moaning wind 
 as it stirs the old ivy boughs entwined 
 sighs mournful along through chancel and nave 
 and shakes the loose panel and architrave 
 while the mouldering branches and withered leaves 
 are rustling around the moss grown eaves 

nor deem he lived unto himself alone 
 his was the public spirit of his sire 
 and in those eyes , soft with domestic fire 
 a quenchless light of fiercer temper shone 
 what time about , the world our shame was blown 
 on every wind ; his soul would not conspire 
 with selfish men to soothe the mob 's desire 
 veiling with garlands moloch 's bloody stone 
 the high bred instincts of a better day 
 ruled in his blood , when to be citizen 
 rang roman yet , and a free people 's sway 
 was not the exchequer of impoverished men 
 nor statesmanship with loaded votes to play 
 nor public office a tramps ’ boosing ken 

nor were his aethiopian comrades left 
 to wander of their king forlorn : a god 
 suddenly winged those eager souls with speed 
 such as should soon be theirs for ever , changed 
 to flying fowl , the children of the air 
 wailing their king in the winds ’ track they sped 
 as when a hunter mid the forest brakes 
 is by a boar or grim jawed lion slain 
 and now his sorrowing friends take up the corse 
 and bear it heavy hearted ; and the hounds 
 follow low whimpering , pining for their lord 
 in that disastrous hunting lost ; so they 
 left far behind that stricken field of blood 
 and fast they followed after those swift winds 

much have i travell 'd in the realms of gold 
 and many goodly states and kingdoms seen 
 round many western islands have i been 
 which bards in fealty to apollo hold 
 oft of one wide expanse had i been told 
 that deep brow 'd homer rul 'd as his demesne 
 yet did i never breathe its pure serene 
 till i heard chapman speak out loud and bold 
 then felt i like some watcher of the skies 
 when a new planet swims into his ken 
 or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes 
 he star 'd at the pacific — and all his men 
 looked at each other with a wild surmise 
 silent , upon a peak in darien 

who 'll , know it ? richard earnestly replied 
 in jack 's concealment we may both confide 
 excuse the trick i 've played and ne'er repine 
 address , force , treachery , in love combine 
 all are permitted when intrigue ‘ s the word 
 to hold the contrary were quite absurd 
 till stratagem was used i naught could gain 
 but looks and darts from eyes , for all my pain 
 i 've paid myself ;— would you have done it ?— no 
 ‘ tis all as might be wished ;— come , smiles bestow 
 i 'm satisfied , the fault was not with you 
 in this , to make you wretched , naught i view 
 why sigh and groan ?— what numbers could i name 
 who would be happy to be served the same 

say that thou didst forsake me for some fault 
 and i will comment upon that offence 
 speak of my lameness , and i straight will halt 
 against thy reasons making no defence 
 thou canst not ( love ) disgrace me half so ill 
 to set a form upon desired change 
 as i 'll my self disgrace , knowing thy will 
 i will acquaintance strangle and look strange 
 be absent from thy walks and in my tongue 
 thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell 
 lest i ( too much profane ) should do it wrong 
 and haply of our old acquaintance tell 
 for thee , against my self i 'll vow debate 
 for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate 

ah , woe is me for pleasure that is vain 
 ah , woe is me for glory that is past 
 pleasure that bringeth sorrow at the last 
 glory that at the last bringeth no gain 
 so saith the sinking heart ; and so again 
 it shall say till the mighty angel blast 
 is blown , making the sun and moon aghast 
 and showering down the stars like sudden rain 
 and evermore men shall go fearfully 
 bending beneath their weight of heaviness 
 and ancient men shall lie down wearily 
 and strong men shall rise up in weariness 
 yea , even the young shall answer sighingly 
 saying one to another : how vain it is 

“ thou too , ernestus ! what protecting doom 
 has guided thee thro ’ fate 's tremendous gloom 
 unhappy relic of a patriot line 
 dost thou with all their ancient glory shine 
 and , unappall 'd by labour or by fear 
 lift for thy country the protecting spear 
 or , wrapt in fetters , and in darkness lost 
 say , dost thou languish for thy native coast 
 perhaps , unnoted , by the tyrant 's eyes 
 in unknown solitude secure he lies 
 whate'er his fate , nor terror 's base control 
 nor hostile bribes , can e'er have moved his soul 
 no ! taught by me , ernestus nobly spurns 
 each vulgar aim , and for his country burns 

one day i wrote her name upon the strand 
 but came the waves and washed it away 
 agayne i wrote it with a second hand 
 but came the tyde , and made my paynes his pray 
 “ vayne man , ” sayd she , “ that doest in vaine assay 
 a mortall thing so to immortalize 
 for i my selve shall lyke to this decay 
 and eke my name bee wyped out lykewize 
 “ not so , ” quod i ; “ let baser things devize 
 to dy in dust , but you shall live by fame 
 my verse your vertues rare shall eternize 
 and in the hevens wryte your glorious name 
 where , when as death shall all the world subdew 
 our love shall live , and later life renew 

when i had chosen on the river 's edge 
 such station , that the distance of the stream 
 alone did separate me ; there i stay 'd 
 my steps for clearer prospect , and beheld 
 the flames go onward , leaving , as they went 
 the air behind them painted as with trail 
 of liveliest pencils ! so distinct were mark 'd 
 all those sev'n listed colours , whence the sun 
 maketh his bow , and cynthia her zone 
 these streaming gonfalons did flow beyond 
 my vision ; and ten paces , as i guess 
 parted the outermost . beneath a sky 
 so beautiful , came foul and twenty elders 
 by two and two , with flower de luces crown 'd 

when she comes home again ! a thousand ways 
 i fashion , to myself , the tenderness 
 of my glad welcome : i shall tremble — yes 
 and touch her , as when first in the old days 
 i touched her girlish hand , nor dared upraise 
 mine eyes , such was my faint heart 's sweet distress 
 then silence : and the perfume of her dress 
 the room will sway a little , and a haze 
 cloy eyesight — soulsight , even — for a space 
 and tears — yes ; and the ache here in the throat 
 to know that i so ill deserve the place 
 her arms make for me ; and the sobbing note 
 i stay with kisses , ere the tearful face 
 again is hidden in the old embrace 

we are ambitious overmuch in life 
 straining at ends of hard accomplishment 
 and goaded onward by poor discontent 
 we build our little babels up through strife 
 and bitterness of soul , and motions rife 
 with passions that oft slay the innocent 
 like priests of lust plunging the cruel knife 
 into the victims of their wilderment 
 not thus do thou , but with a patient hand 
 place thou thine acorn in the fertile soil 
 labouring ever with unhurtful toil 
 and cheerful hope until the seed expand 
 grow with the strength of truth , and ripening time 
 and stand at last in majesty sublime 

on high hills top i saw a stately frame 
 an hundred cubits high by iust assize 
 with hundreth pillours fronting faire the same 
 all wrought with diamond after dorick wize 
 nor brick nor marble was the wall in view 
 but shining christall , which from top to base 
 out of her womb a thousand rayons ** threw 
 on hundred steps of afrike golds enchase 
 golde was the parget ,$ and the seeling bright 
 did shine all scaly with great plates of golde 
 the floore of iasp and emeraude was dight 
 o worlds vainesse ! whiles thus i did behold 
 an earthquake shooke the hill from lowest seat 
 and overthrew this frame with ruine great

when hither you come , do enter our door 
 i 'll give you my hand , perhaps something more 
 let me urge , if inclined , to this you 'll reply 
 i 'll again do my best , yes , surely i 'll try

thus mourn 'd the hapless man : a thundering sound 
 roll 'd thro the shuddering walls and shook the ground 
 o'er all the dungeon , where black arches bend 
 the roofs unfold , and streams of light descend 
 the growing splendor fills the astonish 'd room 
 and gales etherial breathe a glad perfume 
 robed in the radiance , moves a form serene 
 of human structure , but of heavenly mien 
 near to the prisoner 's couch he takes his stand 
 and waves , in sign of peace , his holy hand 
 tall rose his stature , youth 's endearing grace 
 adorn 'd his limbs and brighten 'd in his face 
 loose o'er his locks the star of evening hung 
 and sounds melodious moved his cheerful tongue 

as a bad orator , badly o ’ er book skilled 
 doth overflow his purpose with made heat 
 and , like a clock , winds with withoutness willed 
 what should have been an inner instinct ’ s feat 
 or as a prose wit , harshly poet turned 
 lacking the subtler music in his measure 
 with useless care labours but to be spurned 
 courting in alien speech the muse ’ s pleasure 
 i study how to love or how to hate 
 estranged by consciousness from sentiment 
 with a thought feeling forced to be sedate 
 even when the feeling ’ s nature is violent 
 as who would learn to swim without the river 
 when nearest to the trick , as far as ever 

upon my word , replied another fair 
 if he were mine , i openly declare 
 to judge from what so pleasantly you say 
 i 'd make a present of him new year 's day 
 for pleasure never gives me full delight 
 unless a little pain the bliss invite 
 no doubt your husband moves as he is led 
 thank heav'n a different mortal claims my bed 
 to take him in , great nicety we need 
 but howsoe'er , at times i can succeed 
 the satisfaction doubly then is felt 
 in fond emotion bosoms freely melt 
 with neither of you , husband or gallant 
 would i exchange , though these so much you vaunt 

thinking of you , and all that was , and all 
 that might have been and now can never be 
 i feel your honored excellence , and see 
 myself unworthy of the happier call 
 for woe is me who walk so apt to fall 
 so apt to shrink afraid , so apt to flee 
 apt to lie down and die ( ah , woe is me 
 faithless and hopeless turning to the wall 
 and yet not hopeless quite nor faithless quite 
 because not loveless ; love may toil all night 
 but take at morning ; wrestle till the break 
 of day , but then wield power with god and man 
 so take i heart of grace as best i can 
 ready to spend and be spent for your sake 

“ thus having pass 'd the night in fruitless pain 
 i to my longing friends return again 
 amaz 'd th ’ augmented number to behold 
 of men and matrons mix 'd , of young and old 
 a wretched exil 'd crew together brought 
 with arms appointed , and with treasure fraught 
 resolv 'd , and willing , under my command 
 to run all hazards both of sea and land 
 the morn began , from ida , to display 
 her rosy cheeks ; and phosphor led the day 
 before the gates the grecians took their post 
 and all pretense of late relief was lost 
 i yield to fate , unwillingly retire 
 and , loaded , up the hill convey my sire 

the whole world on a raft ! a duke is here 
 at sight of whose lank jaw the muses leer 
 journeyman printer , lamb with ferret eyes 
 in life 's skullduggery he takes the prize 
 yet stands at twilight wrapped in hamlet dreams 
 into his eyes the mississippi gleams 
 the sandbar sings in moonlit veils of foam 
 a candle shines from one lone cabin home 
 the waves reflect it like a drunken star 
 a banjo and a hymn are heard afar 
 no solace on the lazy shore excels 
 the duke 's blue castle with its steamer bells 
 the floor is running water , and the roof 
 the stars ’ brocade with cloudy warp and woof 

each soul i might have succored , may have slain 
 all souls shall face me at the last appeal 
 that great last moment poised for woe or weal 
 that final moment for man 's bliss or bane 
 vanity of vanities , yea all is vain 
 which then will not avail or help or heal 
 disfeatured faces , worn out knees that kneel 
 will more avail than strength or beauty then 
 lord , by thy passion ,— when thy face was marred 
 in sight of earth and hell tumultuous 
 and thy heart failed in thee like melting wax 
 and thy blood dropped more precious than the nard 
 lord , for thy sake , not ours , supply our lacks 
 for thine own sake , not ours , christ , pity us 

another that has got a handsome wife 
 makes her the only heaven of his life 
 keeps her extravagantly , fine and gay 
 and never thinks she makes too much away 
 the treats and balls she is invited to 
 and he good man , consents that she shall go 
 believes her company is much desired 
 and 's proud to think she shou 'd be so admired 
 until at length , by chance he finds the truth 
 and catches her with some enamour 'd youth 
 surpriz 'd — but dare not make the matter known 
 conceals her shame , that he may hide his own 
 he ever after spends an anxious life 
 heavy his sorrow , and as light his wife 

as to some lovely temple , tenantless 
 long since , that once was sweet with shivering brass 
 knowing well its altars ruined and the grass 
 grown up between the stones , yet from excess 
 of grief hard driven , or great loneliness 
 the worshiper returns , and those who pass 
 marvel him crying on a name that was 
 so is it now with me in my distress 
 your body was a temple to delight 
 cold are its ashes whence the breath is fled 
 yet here one time your spirit was wont to move 
 here might i hope to find you day or night 
 and here i come to look for you , my love 
 even now , foolishly , knowing you are dead 

thou man of science , who , with practised eye 
 and glance untiring sweep'st the starry sky 
 speeding in thought along those trackless ways 
 where planets burn and constellations blaze 
 leaving uncounted worlds behind thee far 
 listen — “ i am the bright and morning star 
 he says — and does not thought more gladly stray 
 where the meek herald of the rising day 
 sits like a peaceful vestal bearing high 
 her radiant urn on the soft eastern sky 
 thence , rising , seek the morning star of heaven 
 who to night 's myriad suns their light has given 
 and , bowing low light 's sacred fount before 
 in wondering , reverential awe adore 

sweet bird , that sing'st away the early hours 
 of winters past or coming , void of care 
 well pleased with delights which present are 
 fair seasons , budding sprays , sweet smelling flowers 
 to rocks , to springs , to rills , from leafy bowers 
 thou thy creator 's goodness dost declare 
 and what dear gifts on thee he did not spare 
 a stain to human sense in sin that lowers 
 what soul can be so sick , which by thy songs 
 attired in sweetness , sweetly is not driven 
 quite to forget earth 's turmoils , spites , and wrongs 
 and lift a reverend eye and thought to heaven 
 sweet artless songster , thou my mind dost raise 
 to airs of spheres , yes , and to angels ’ lays 

nay , we are children : we will not mature 
 a blessed gift must seem a theft ; and tears 
 must storm our eyes when but a joy appears 
 in drear disguise of sorrow ; and how poor 
 we seem when we are richest ,— most secure 
 against all poverty the lifelong years 
 we yet must waste in childish doubts and fears 
 that , in despite of reason , still endure 
 alas ! the sermon of the rose we will 
 not wisely ponder ; nor the sobs of grief 
 lulled into sighs of rapture ; nor the cry 
 of fierce defiance that again is still 
 be patient — patient with our frail belief 
 and stay it yet a little ere we die 

“ oh bless 'd ulysses ! ( thus the king express 'd 
 his sudden rapture ) in thy consort bless 'd 
 not more thy wisdom than her virtue shined 
 not more thy patience than her constant mind 
 icarius ’ daughter , glory of the past 
 and model to the future age , shall last 
 the gods , to honour her fair fame , shall rise 
 ( their great reward ) a poet in her praise 
 not such , o tyndarus ! thy daughter 's deed 
 by whose dire hand her king and husband bled 
 her shall the muse to infamy prolong 
 example dread , and theme of tragic song 
 the general sex shall suffer in her shame 
 and e'en the best that bears a woman 's name 

if that one care had our two hearts possessed 
 or you once ( felt ) what i long suffer è d 
 then should thy heart accuse in my heart 's stead 
 the rigour of itself for mine unrest 
 then should thine arm upon my shoulder rest 
 and weight of grief sway down thy troubled head 
 then should thy tears upon my sheet be shed 
 and then thy heart should pant upon my breast 
 but when that other cares thy heart do seize 
 alas , what succour gain i then by this 
 but double grief for thine and mine unease 
 yet when thou see'st thy hurts to wound my heart 
 and so art taught by me what pity is 
 perhaps thy heart will learn to feel my smart 

to them zorobabel , on themes like these 
 “ seek ye the monarch of mankind to please 
 “ to wine superior or to power 's strong arms 
 “ be mine to sing resistless woman 's charms 
 “ to him victorious in the rival lays 
 “ shall just darius give the meed of praise 
 “ the purple robe his honor 'd frame shall fold 
 “ the beverage sparkle in his cup of gold 
 “ a golden couch support his bed of rest 
 “ the chain of honor grace his favor 'd breast 
 “ his the soft turban , his the car 's array 
 “ o'er babylon 's high wall to wheel its way 
 “ and for his wisdom seated on the throne 
 “ for the king 's cousin shall the bard be known 

in march , his natal month , through sleet and rain 
 he bore his wife , who did not once complain 
 no wedding jaunt could their small means afford 
 yet they had pleasure in true love 's accord 
 and what they lacked in way of outward show 
 was quite made up by warm affection 's glow 
 they were a happy couple , with warm hearts 
 both striving eagerly to act their parts 
 if ever twain were blended into one 
 ‘ twas in their case , as all who knew them own 
 he , working soon and late to rid his debt 
 she taking care of all he chanced to get 
 and , with sweet smiles upon her face 
 dispelling of despondency each trace 

vanity of vanities , the preacher saith 
 all things are vanity . the eye and ear 
 cannot be filled with what they see and hear 
 like early dew , or like the sudden breath 
 of wind , or like the grass that withereth 
 is man , tossed to and fro by hope and fear 
 so little joy hath he , so little cheer 
 till all things end in the long dust of death 
 to day is still the same as yesterday 
 to morrow also even as one of them 
 and there is nothing new under the sun 
 until the ancient race of time be run 
 the old thorns shall grow out of the old stem 
 and morning shall be cold and twilight grey 

that god forbid , that made me first your slave 
 i should in thought control your times of pleasure 
 or at your hand th ’ account of hours to crave 
 being your vassal bound to stay your leisure 
 o let me suffer ( being at your beck 
 th ’ imprisoned absence of your liberty 
 and patience tame to sufferance bide each check 
 without accusing you of injury 
 be where you list , your charter is so strong 
 that you your self may privilage your time 
 to what you will , to you it doth belong 
 your self to pardon of self doing crime 
 i am to wait , though waiting so be hell 
 not blame your pleasure be it ill or well 

as where two raging venoms are united 
 which of themselves dissevered life would sever 
 the sickly wretch of sickness is acquited 
 which else should die , or pine in torments ever 
 so fire and frost , that hold my heart in seizure 
 restore those ruins which themselves have wrought 
 where if apart they both had had their pleasure 
 the earth long since her fatal claim had caught 
 thus two united deaths keep me from dying 
 i burne in ice , and quake amidst the fire 
 no hope midst these extremes or favour spying 
 thus love makes me a martyr in his ire 
 so that both cold and heat do rather feed 
 my ceaseless pains , than any comfort breed 

“ thus fierce he said : we sighing went our way 
 and with desponding hearts put off to sea 
 the sailors spent with toils their folly mourn 
 but mourn in vain ; no prospect of return 
 six days and nights a doubtful course we steer 
 the next proud lamos ’ stately towers appear 
 and laestrygonia 's gates arise distinct in air 
 the shepherd , quitting here at night the plain 
 calls , to succeed his cares , the watchful swain 
 but he that scorns the chains of sleep to wear 
 and adds the herdsman 's to the shepherd 's care 
 so near the pastures , and so short the way 
 his double toils may claim a double pay 
 and join the labours of the night and day 

the prince return 'd : “ renown 'd in days of yore 
 has stood our father 's hospitable door 
 no other roof a stranger should receive 
 no other hands than ours the welcome give 
 but in my absence riot fills the place 
 nor bears the modest queen a stranger 's face 
 from noiseful revel far remote she flies 
 but rarely seen , or seen with weeping eyes 
 no — let eurymachus receive my guest 
 of nature courteous , and by far the best 
 he woos the queen with more respectful flame 
 and emulates her former husband 's fame 
 with what success , ‘ tis jove 's alone to know 
 and the hoped nuptials turn to joy or woe 

“ ‘ tis strange what very strong advising 
 by word of mouth , or advertising 
 by chalking on walls , or placarding on vans 
 with fifty other different plans 
 the very high pressure , in fact , of pressing 
 it needs to persuade one to purchase a blessing 
 whether the soothing american syrup 
 a safety hat , or a safety stirrup 
 infallible pills for the human frame 
 or rowland 's o don'thypppheno ( an ominous name 
 a doudney 's suit which the shape so hits 
 that it beats all others into fits 
 a mechi 's razor for beards unshorn 
 or a ghost of a whisper catching horn 

the irresponsive silence of the land 
 the irresponsive sounding of the sea 
 speak both one message of one sense to me 
 aloof , aloof , we stand aloof , so stand 
 thou too aloof bound with the flawless band 
 of inner solitude ; we bind not thee 
 but who from thy self chain shall set thee free 
 what heart shall touch thy heart ? what hand thy hand 
 and i am sometimes proud and sometimes meek 
 and sometimes i remember days of old 
 when fellowship seemed not so far to seek 
 and all the world and i seemed much less cold 
 and at the rainbow 's foot lay surely gold 
 and hope felt strong and life itself not weak 

‘ here let us walk , ’ he said , ‘ observed by none 
 conscious of pleasures to the world unknown 
 so may my soul have joy , as thou , my wife 
 art far the dearest solace of my life 
 and rather would i choose , by heaven above 
 to die this instant , than to lose thy love 
 reflect what truth was in my passion shown 
 when , unendow 'd , i took thee for my own 
 and sought no treasure but thy heart alone 
 old as i am , and now deprived of sight 
 whilst thou art faithful to thy own true knight 
 nor age , nor blindness rob me of delight 
 each other loss with patience i can bear 
 the loss of thee is what i only fear 

then tall wak â wa arose and said 
 “ brave warriors , listen , and give due heed 
 great is hey ó ka , the magical god 
 he can walk on the air ; he can float on the flood 
 he 's a worker of magic and wonderful wise 
 he cries when he laughs and he laughs when he cries 
 he sweats when he 's cold , and he shivers when hot 
 and the water is cold in his boiling pot 
 he hides in the earth and he walks in disguise 
 but he loves the brave and their sacrifice 
 we are sons of hey ó ka . the giant commands 
 in the boiling water to thrust our hands 
 and the warrior that scorneth the foe and fire 
 hey ó ka will crown with his hearts desire 

now gentle sleep hath clos è d up those eyes 
 which waking kept my boldest thoughts in awe 
 and free access unto that sweet lip lies 
 from whence i long the rosy breath to draw 
 methinks no wrong it were if i should steal 
 from those two melting rubies , one poor kiss 
 none sees the theft that would the thief reveal 
 nor rob i her of aught which she can miss 
 nay , should i twenty kisses take away 
 there would be little sign i had done so 
 why then should i this robbery delay 
 oh , she may wake , and therewith angry grow 
 well , if she do , i 'll back restore that one

thou art the rock of empire , set mid seas 
 between the east and west , that god has built 
 advance thy roman borders where thou wilt 
 while run thy armies true with his decrees 
 law , justice , liberty ,— great gifts are these 
 watch that they spread where english blood is spilt 
 lest , mixt and sullied with his country 's guilt 
 the soldier 's life stream flow and heaven displease 
 two swords there are : one naked , apt to smite 
 thy blade of war ; and , battled storied , one 
 rejoices in the sheath and hides from light 
 american i am ; would wars were done 
 now westward look , my country bids good night 
 peace to the world from ports without a gun 

what , cringe to europe ! band it all in one 
 stilt its decrepit strength , renew its age 
 wipe out its debts , contract a loan to wage 
 its venal battles ,— and , by yon bright sun 
 our god is false , and liberty undone 
 if slaves have power to win your heritage 
 look on your country , god 's appointed stage 
 where man 's vast mind its boundless course shall run 
 for that it was your stormy coast he spread 
 a fear in winter ; girded you about 
 with granite hills , and made you strong and dread 
 let him who fears before the foemen shout 
 or gives an inch before a vein has bled 
 turn on himself , and let the traitor out 

dark vault of heaven , that greet his daily throne 
 where flee the glories of your absent sun 
 ye starry hosts , who kindle from his eye 
 can you behold him in the western sky 
 or if unseen beneath his watery bed 
 the wearied god reclines his radiant head 
 when next his morning steps your courts inflame 
 and seek on earth for young azonto 's name 
 then point these ashes , mark the smoky pile 
 and say the hero suffer 'd with a smile 
 so shall the power in vengeance view the place 
 in crimson clothe his terror beaming face 
 pour swift destruction on these curst abodes 
 whelm the grim tribes and all their savage gods 

here is the place where loveliness keeps house 
 between the river and the wooded hills 
 within a valley where the springtime spills 
 her firstling wind flowers under blossoming boughs 
 where summer sits braiding her warm , white brows 
 with bramble roses ; and where autumn fills 
 her lap with asters ; and old winter frills 
 with crimson haw and hip his snowy blouse 
 here you may meet with beauty . here she sits 
 gazing upon the moon , or all the day 
 tuning a wood thrush flute , remote , unseen 
 or when the storm is out , ‘ t is she who flits 
 from rock to rock , a form of flying spray 
 shouting , beneath the leaves ’ tumultuous green 

great soul , thou sittest with me in my room 
 uplifting me with thy vast , quiet eyes 
 on whose full orbs , with kindly lustre , lies 
 the twilight warmth of ruddy ember gloom 
 thy clear , strong tones will oft bring sudden bloom 
 of hope secure , to him who lonely cries 
 wrestling with the young poet 's agonies 
 neglect and scorn , which seem a certain doom 
 yes ! the few words which , like great thunder drops 
 thy large heart down to earth shook doubtfully 
 thrilled by the inward lightning of its might 
 serene and pure , like gushing joy of light 
 shall track the eternal chords of destiny 
 after the moon led pulse of ocean stops 

the light of life has faded from thy cause 
 high priest of heaven and hell and purgatory 
 thy lips are loud with strains of oldworld story 
 but the red prey was rent out of thy paws 
 long since : and they that dying brake down thy laws 
 have with the fires of death enkindled glory 
 put out the flame that faltered on thy hoary 
 high altars , waning with the world 's applause 
 this italy was dante 's : bruno died 
 here : campanella , too sublime for pride 
 endured thy god 's worst here , and hence went home 
 and what art thou , that time 's full tide should shrink 
 for thy sake downward ? what art thou , to think 
 thy god shall give thee back for birthright rome 

who hath not glowed above the page where fame 
 hath fixed high caledon 's unconquered name 
 the mountain land which spurned the roman chain 
 and baffled back the fiery crested dane 
 whose bright claymore and hardihood of hand 
 no foe could tame — no tyrant could command 
 that race is gone — but still their children breathe 
 and glory crowns them with redoubled wreath 
 o'er gael and saxon mingling banners shine 
 and , england ! add their stubborn strength to thine 
 the blood which flowed with wallace flows as free 
 but now ‘ tis only shed for fame and thee 
 oh ! pass not by the northern veteran 's claim 
 but give support — the world hath given him fame 

impelled by feelings in their nature kind 
 but slightly weak and somewhat undefined 
 rush at each other , make a sudden stand 
 begin to talk , expatiate , and expand 
 each looks quite radiant , seems extremely struck 
 their meeting so was such a piece of luck 
 each thinks the other thinks he ‘ s greatly pleased 
 to screw the vice in which they both are squeezed 
 so there they talk , in dust , or mud , or snow 
 both bored to death , and both afraid to go 
 your hat once lifted , do not hang your fire 
 nor , like slow ajax , fighting still , retire 
 when your old castor on your crown you clap 
 go off ; you 've mounted your percussion cap 

death , what hast thou to do with one for whom 
 time is not lord , but servant ? what least part 
 of all the fire that fed his living heart 
 of all the light more keen than sundawn 's bloom 
 that lit and led his spirit , strong as doom 
 and bright as hope , can aught thy breath may dart 
 quench ? nay , thou knowest he knew thee what thou art 
 a shadow born of terror 's barren womb 
 that brings not forth save shadows . what art thou 
 to dream , albeit thou breathe upon his brow 
 that power on him is given thee ,— that thy breath 
 can make him less than love acclaims him now 
 and hears all time sound back the word it saith 
 what part hast thou then in his glory , death 

being your slave what should i do but tend 
 upon the hours , and times of your desire 
 i have no precious time at all to spend 
 nor services to do till you require 
 nor dare i chide the world without end hour 
 whilst i ( my sovereign ) watch the clock for you 
 nor think the bitterness of absence sour 
 when you have bid your servant once adieu 
 nor dare i question with my jealous thought 
 where you may be , or your affairs suppose 
 but like a sad slave stay and think of nought 
 save where you are , how happy you make those 
 so true a fool is love , that in your will 
 ( though you do any thing ) he thinks no ill 

the rumour runs that here in isis swim 
 such stately swans so confident in dying 
 that when they feel themselves near lethe 's brim 
 they sing their fatal dirge when death is nighing 
 and i like these that feel my wounds are mortal 
 contented die for her whom i adore 
 and in my joyful hymns do still exhort all 
 to die for such a saint or love no more 
 not that my torments or her tyranny 
 enforce me to enjoin so hard a task 
 but for i know , and yield no reason why 
 but will them try that have desire to ask 
 as love hath wreaths his pretty eyes to seel 
 so lovers must keep secret what they feel 

of all the causes which conspire to blind 
 man 's erring judgment and misguide the mind 
 what the weak head with strongest bias rules 
 is pride , the never failing vice of fools 
 whatever nature has in worth denied 
 she gives in large recruits of needful pride 
 for as in bodies , thus in souls , we find 
 what wants in blood and spirits , swelled with wind 
 pride where wit fails steps in to our defense 
 and fills up all the mighty void of sense 
 if once right reason drives that cloud away 
 truth breaks upon us with resistless day 
 trust not yourself , but your defects to know 
 make use of every friend — and every foe 

christ , dost thou live indeed ? or are thy bones 
 still straitened in their rock hewn sepulchre 
 and was thy rising only dreamed by her 
 whose love of thee for all her sin atones 
 for here the air is horrid with men 's groans 
 the priests who call upon thy name are slain 
 dost thou not hear the bitter wail of pain 
 from those whose children lie upon the stones 
 come down , o son of god ! incestuous gloom 
 curtains the land , and through the starless night 
 over thy cross a crescent moon i see 
 if thou in very truth didst burst the tomb 
 come down , o son of man ! and show thy might 
 lest mahomet be crowned instead of thee 

when she comes home again ! a thousand ways 
 i fashion , to myself , the tenderness 
 of my glad welcome : i shall tremble — yes 
 and touch her , as when first in the old days 
 i touched her girlish hand , nor dared upraise 
 mine eyes , such was my faint heart 's sweet distress 
 then silence : and the perfume of her dress 
 the room will sway a little , and a haze 
 cloy eyesight — soul sight , even — for a space 
 and tears — yes ; and the ache here in the throat 
 to know that i so ill deserve the place 
 her arms make for me ; and the sobbing note 
 i stay with kisses , ere the tearful face 
 again is hidden in the old embrace 

if truth there be in old cratinus ’ song 
 no verse , you know , maecenas , can live long 
 writ by a water drinker . since the day 
 when bacchus took us poets into pay 
 with fauns and satyrs , the celestial nine 
 have smelt each morning of last evening 's wine 
 the praises heaped by homer on the bowl 
 at once convict him as a thirsty soul 
 and father ennius ne'er could be provoked 
 to sing of battles till his lips were soaked 
 “ let temperate folk write verses in the hall 
 where bonds change hands , abstainers not at all 
 so ran my edict : now the clan drinks hard 
 and vinous breath distinguishes a bard 

“ o mother ida , harken ere i die 
 still she spake on and still she spake of power 
 ‘ which in all action is the end of all 
 power fitted to the season ; wisdom bred 
 and throned of wisdom — from all neighbour crowns 
 alliance and allegiance , till thy hand 
 fail from the sceptre staff . such boon from me 
 from me , heaven 's queen , paris to thee king born 
 a shepherd all thy life but yet king born 
 should come most welcome , seeing men , in power 
 only , are likest gods , who have attain 'd 
 rest in a happy place and quiet seats 
 above the thunder , with undying bliss 
 in knowledge of their own supremacy 

there is a race of men , who master life 
 their victory being inversely as their strife 
 who capture by refraining from pursuit 
 shake not the bough , yet load their hands with fruit 
 the earth 's high places who attain to fill 
 by most indomitably sitting still 
 while others , full upon the fortress hurled 
 lay fiery siege to the embattled world 
 of such rude arts their natures feel no need 
 greatly inert , they lazily succeed 
 find in the golden mean their proper bliss 
 and doing nothing , never do amiss 
 but lapt in men 's good graces live , and die 
 by all regretted , nobody knows why 

and then with her round , brown arms she pressed 
 his phantom form to her throbbing breast 
 and whispered the name , in her happy sleep 
 of her h ó h é hunter so fair and far 
 and then she saw in her dreams the deep 
 where the spirit wailed , and a falling star 
 then stealthily crouching under the trees 
 by the light of the moon , the kan ó ti dan 
 the little , wizened , mysterious man 
 with his long locks tossed by the moaning breeze 
 then a flap of wings , like a thunder bird 
 and a wailing spirit the sleeper heard 
 and lo , through the mists of the moon , she saw 
 the hateful visage of h â rpstin à. 

to whom earth shaking neptune thus replied 
 “ immortal iris , weighty are thy words 
 and in good season spoken ; and ‘ tis well 
 when envoys are by sound discretion led 
 yet are my heart and mind with grief oppress 'd 
 when me , his equal both by birth and fate 
 he seeks with haughty words to overbear 
 i yield , but with indignant sense of wrong 
 this too i say , nor shall my threat be vain 
 let him remember , if in my despite 
 ‘ gainst pallas ’ , juno 's , hermes ’ , vulcan 's will 
 he spare to overthrow proud ilium 's tow'rs 
 and crown with victory the grecian arms 
 the feud between us never can be heal 'd 

around her grew a stillness unto death 
 the waves their ever restless motion stayed 
 all living nature seemed to hold its breath 
 as if by some stupendous power o'erweighed 
 and right athwart the sunset 's fading glow 
 a great black cloud , like some huge monstrous thing 
 threw round and round the sun 's last dipping ring 
 the impress of its shadow drooping low 
 and lower , lower fell that mighty cloud 
 with menacing shape as in defiance proud 
 until at last all sky and earth and sea 
 seemed filled with shadows from its darkening wings 
 that dreadful spell cast over waves once free 
 hushed into silence deep all living things 

the birds sung their sorrows the whole summer long 
 and the robin first mixed up his ills with his song 
 he sung of his griefs — how in love he 'd been crossed 
 and gave up his heart as eternally lost 
 ‘ t was burnt to a coal , as sly cupid let fall 
 a spark that scorched through both the feathers and all 
 to cure it time tried , but ne'er found out the way 
 so the mark on his bosom he wears to this day 
 and when birds are all silent , and not a leaf seen 
 on the trees , but the ivy and holly so green 
 in frost and in snow little robin will sing 
 to put off the sorrow that ruffles his wing 
 and that is the cause in our gardens we hear 
 the robin 's sweet note at the close of the year 

gold counts for more than silver , all men hold

 though soul , tongue , morals , credit , all the while

 but mark those children at their play ; they sing 
 “ deal fairly , youngster , and we 'll crown you king

is it a reed that 's shaken by the wind 
 or what is it that ye go forth to see 
 lords , lawyers , statesmen , squires of low degree

 with first fruit offerings crowd to bend the knee 
 in france , before the new born majesty

 a seemly reverence may be paid to power

his brother thus with counsels wise dismiss 'd 
 the king to aged nestor took his way 
 him by his tent and dark ribb 'd ship he found 
 on a soft couch ; beside him lay his arms 
 his shield , two lances , and a glitt'ring helm 
 there lay the rich wrought belt the old man wore 
 when to the battle , arm 'd , he led his troops 
 for nought to age 's weakness would he yield

ser federigo thought not of the chase 
 the tender vision of her lovely face 
 i will not say he seems to see , he sees 
 in the leaf shadows of the trellises 
 herself , yet not herself ; a lovely child 
 with flowing tresses , and eyes wide and wild 
 coming undaunted up the garden walk 
 and looking not at him , but at the hawk 
 “ beautiful falcon ! ” said he , “ would that i 
 might hold thee on my wrist , or see thee fly 
 the voice was hers , and made strange echoes start 
 through all the haunted chambers of his heart 
 as an aeolian harp through gusty doors 
 of some old ruin its wild music pours 

as an unperfect actor on the stage 
 who with his fear is put beside his part 
 or some fierce thing replete with too much rage 
 whose strength 's abundance weakens his own heart 
 so i for fear of trust , forget to say 
 the perfect ceremony of love 's rite 
 and in mine own love 's strength seem to decay 
 o'ercharged with burthen of mine own love 's might 
 o let my looks be then the eloquence 
 and dumb presagers of my speaking breast 
 who plead for love , and look for recompense 
 more than that tongue that more hath more expressed 
 o learn to read what silent love hath writ 
 to hear with eyes belongs to love 's fine wit 

more then most faire , full of the living fire 
 kindled above unto the maker nere 
 no eies , but ioyes , in which al powers conspire 
 that to the world naught else be counted deare 
 thrugh your bright beams doth not the blinded guest 
 shoot out his darts to base affections wound 
 but angels come , to lead fraile mindes to rest 
 in chast desires , on heavenly beauty bound 
 you frame my thoughts , and fashion me within 
 you stop my toung , and teach my hart to speake 
 you calme the storme that passion did begin 
 strong thrugh your cause , but by your vertue weak 
 dark is the world where your light shined never 
 well is he borne that may behold you ever 

“ ah follow me ! ( she cried ) what plaintive noise 
 invades my ear ? ’ tis sure my mother ’ s voice 
 my faltering knees their trembling frame desert 
 a pulse unusual flutters at my heart 
 some strange disaster , some reverse of fate 
 ( ye gods avert it !) threats the trojan state 
 far be the omen which my thoughts suggest 
 but much i fear my hector ’ s dauntless breast 
 confronts achilles ; chased along the plain 
 shut from our walls ! i fear , i fear him slain 
 safe in the crowd he ever scorn ’ d to wait 
 and sought for glory in the jaws of fate 
 perhaps that noble heat has cost his breath 
 now quench ’ d for ever in the arms of death 

whether he lurked in the oldtown fen 
 or the gray earth flax of the devil 's den 
 or swam in the wooded artichoke 
 or coiled by the northman 's written rock 
 nothing on record is left to show 
 only the fact that be lived , we know 
 and left the cast of a double head 
 in the scaly mask which he yearly shed 
 for he carried a head where his tail should be 
 and the two , of course , could never agree 
 but wriggled about with main and might 
 now to the left and now to the right 
 pulling and twisting this way and that 
 neither knew what the other was at 

‘ sing , happy land ! the isle that , prescient long 
 long waiting , hid her monarch in her heart 
 shall look on him and cry , “ my flesh , my bone 
 my son , my king ! ” to him shall cambria bow 
 and alba 's self . his strength is in his god 
 the third part of his time he gives to prayer 
 and god shall hear his vows ! hail , mighty king 
 for aye thine england 's glory ! as i gaze 
 methinks i see a likeness on thy brow 
 likeness to one who kneels beside my feet 
 the sceptre comes to him who sceptre spurned 
 through him it comes who sceptre clasped in sport 
 from wessex ’ soil shall england 's hope be born 
 two centuries hence ; and alfred is his name 

autumn comes laden with her ripened load 
 of fruitage and so scatters them abroad 
 that each fern smothered heath and mole hill waste 
 are black with bramble berries — where in haste 
 the chubby urchins from the village hie 
 to feast them there , stained with the purple dye 
 while painted woods around my rambles be 
 in draperies worthy of eternity 
 yet will the leaves soon patter on the ground 
 and death 's deaf voice awake at every sound 
 one drops — then others — and the last that fell 
 rings for those left behind their passing bell 
 thus memory every where her tidings brings 
 how sad death robs us of life 's dearest things 

to whom , with fierce aspect , achilles thus 
 “ knee me no knees , vile hound ! nor prate to me 
 of parents ! such my hatred , that almost 
 i could persuade myself to tear and eat 
 thy mangled flesh ; such wrongs i have to avenge 
 he lives not , who can save thee from the dogs 
 not though with ransom ten and twenty fold 
 he here should stand , and yet should promise more 
 no , not though priam 's royal self should sue 
 to be allow 'd for gold to ransom thee 
 no , not e'en so , thy mother shall obtain 
 to lay thee out upon the couch , and mourn 
 o'er thee , her offspring ; but on all thy limbs 
 shall dogs and carrion vultures make their feast 

pale are my looks , forsaken of my life 
 cinders my bones , consum è d with thy flame 
 floods are my tears , to end this burning strife 
 and yet i sigh for to increase the same 
 i mourn alone because alone i burn 
 who doubts of this , then let him learn to love 
 her looks cold ice into a flame can turn 
 as i distress è d in myself do prove 
 respect , fair licia , what my torments are 
 count but the tithe both of my sighs and tears 
 see how my love doth still increase my care 
 and care 's increase my life to nothing wears 
 send but a sigh my flame for to increase 
 or lend a tear and cause it so to cease 

against my love shall be as i am now 
 with time 's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn 
 when hours have drained his blood and filled his brow 
 with lines and wrinkles , when his youthful morn 
 hath travelled on to age 's steepy night 
 and all those beauties whereof now he 's king 
 are vanishing , or vanished out of sight 
 stealing away the treasure of his spring 
 for such a time do i now fortify 
 against confounding age 's cruel knife 
 that he shall never cut from memory 
 my sweet love 's beauty , though my lover 's life 
 his beauty shall in these black lines be seen 
 and they shall live , and he in them still green 

the other meets me in the public throng 
 her hair streams backward from her loose attire 
 she hath a trumpet and an eye of fire 
 she points me downward , steadily and long 
 “ there is thy grave — arise , my son , be strong 
 hands are upon thy crown — awake , aspire 
 to immortality ; heed not the lyre 
 of the enchantress , nor her poppy song 
 but in the stillness of the summer calm 
 tremble for what is godlike in thy being 
 listen a while , and thou shall hear the psalm 
 of victory sung by creatures past thy seeing 
 and from far battle fields there comes the neighing 
 of dreadful onset , though the air is balm 

sir ambrose higham , in his eightieth year 
 with memory unimpair 'd , and conscience clear 
 his english heart untrammell 'd , and full blown 
 his senatorial honours and renown 
 now , basking in his plenitude of fame 
 resolved , in concert with his noble dame 
 to drive to town no more — no more by night 
 to meet in crowded courts a blaze of light 
 in streets a roaring mob with flags unfurl 'd 
 and all the senseless discord of the world 
 but calmly wait the hour of his decay 
 the broad bright sunset of his glorious day 
 and where he first drew breath at last to fall 
 beneath the towering shades of oakly hall [ a 

him thus inactive , with an ardent look 
 the prince beheld , and high resenting spoke 
 “ thy hate to troy , is this the time to show 
 ( o wretch ill fated , and thy country ’ s foe 
 paris and greece against us both conspire 
 thy close resentment , and their vengeful ire 
 for thee great ilion ’ s guardian heroes fall 
 till heaps of dead alone defend her wall 
 for thee the soldier bleeds , the matron mourns 
 and wasteful war in all its fury burns 
 ungrateful man ! deserves not this thy care 
 our troops to hearten , and our toils to share

 and all the phrygian glories at an end 

the silvery dimness of a happy dream 
 i 've known of late . methought where byron moans 
 like some wild gulf in melancholy zones 
 i passed tear blinded . once a lurid gleam 
 of stormy sunset loitered on the sea 
 while , travelling troubled like a straitened stream 
 the voice of shelley died away from me 
 still sore at heart , i reached a lake lit lea 
 and then the green mossed glades with many a grove 
 where lies the calm which wordsworth used to love 
 and , lastly , locksley hall , from whence did rise 
 a haunting song that blew and breathed and blew 
 with rare delights . ‘ twas there i woke and knew 
 the sumptuous comfort left in drowsy eyes 

eventful volume ! whatsoe'er the change 
 of scene and clime — the adventures bold and strange 
 the griefs — the frailties but too frankly told 
 the loves , the feuds thy pages may unfold 
 if truth with half so prompt a hand unlocks 
 his virtues as his failings , we shall find 
 the record there of friendships held like rocks 
 and enmities like sun touched snow resigned 
 of fealty , cherisht without change or chill 
 in those who served him , young , and serve him still 
 of generous aid given , with that noiseless art 
 which wakes not pride , to many a wounded heart 
 of acts — but , no — not from himself must aught 
 of the bright features of his life be sought 

unquiet thought ! whom at the first i bred 
 of th'inward bale of my love pined hart 
 and sithens have with sighes and sorrowes fed 
 till greater then my wombe thou woxen art 
 breake forth at length out of the inner part 
 in which thou lurkest lyke to vipers brood 
 and seeke some succour both to ease my smart 
 and also to sustayne thy selfe with food 
 but if in presence of that fayrest proud 
 thou chance to come , fall lowly at her feet 
 and with meek humblesse and afflicted mood 
 pardon for thee , and grace for me , intreat 
 which if she graunt , then live , and my love cherish 
 if not , die soone , and i with thee will perish 

where silent zephyrs sported with the dust 
 of the bastille , i sate in the open sun 
 and from the rubbish gathered up a stone 
 and pocketed the relic , [ g ] in the guise 
 of an enthusiast ; yet , in honest truth 
 i looked for something that i could not find 
 affecting more emotion than i felt 
 for ‘ tis most certain , that these various sights 
 however potent their first shock , with me 
 appeared to recompense the traveller 's pains 
 less than the painted magdalene of le brun , [ h 
 a beauty exquisitely wrought , with hair 
 dishevelled , gleaming eyes , and rueful cheek 
 pale and bedropped with everflowing tears 

that time was come , or seem 'd as it was come 
 when death no longer makes the grave his home 
 when waking spirits leave their earthly rest 
 to mix for ever with the damn 'd or blest 
 when years , in drowsy thousands counted by 
 are hung on minutes with their destiny 
 when time in terror drops his draining glass 
 and all things mortal , like to shadows , pass 
 as ‘ neath approaching tempests sinks the sun 
 when time shall leave eternity begun 
 life swoon 'd in terror at that hour 's dread birth 
 as in an ague , shook the fearful earth 
 and shuddering nature seemed herself to shun 
 whilst trembling conscience felt the deed was done 

how long shall i in mine affliction mourn 
 a burden to myself , distressed in mind 
 when shall my interdicted hopes return 
 from out despair wherein they live confined 
 when shall her troubled brow charged with disdain 
 reveal the treasure which her smiles impart 
 when shall my faith the happiness attain 
 to break the ice that hath congealed her heart 
 unto herself , herself my love doth summon 
 ( if love in her hath any power to move 
 and let her tell me , as she is a woman 
 whether my faith hath not deserved her love 
 i know her heart cannot but judge with me 
 although her eyes my adversaries be 

surprised by joy — impatient as the wind 
 i turned to share the transport — oh ! with whom 
 but thee , deep buried in the silent tomb 
 that spot which no vicissitude can find 
 love , faithful love , recalled thee to my mind 
 but how could i forget thee ? through what power 
 even for the least division of an hour 
 have i been so beguiled as to be blind 
 to my most grievous loss ?— that thought 's return 
 was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore 
 save one , one only , when i stood forlorn 
 knowing my heart 's best treasure was no more 
 that neither present time , nor years unborn 
 could to my sight that heavenly face restore 

common are cooks , professed , plain alike 
 and common , youths their sustenance who feed on 
 common ( i 'm told ) a breach of promise suit 
 and common , damages , in courts agreed on 
 common are briefs as blackberries ; and fees 
 are common quite as “ leather and prunella 
 common are “ unprotected ” witnesses 
 ( “ credat ” — as horace somewhere sings — “ apella 
 but most uncommon seems a lowly cook 
 who with sincerity can kiss the book 
 and swear ( to shame her betters !) ne'er she took 
 by sad “ mistake or otherwise , ” by hook 
 or , as will eventuate , by crook 
 be it silk or gingham — any one 's umbrella 

the swift assailants still no fire return 
 but , tow'rd the batteries that above them burn 
 climb hard from crag to crag ; and scaling higher 
 they pierce the long dense canopy of fire 
 that sheeted all the sky ; then rush amain 
 storm every outwork , each dread summit gain 
 hew timber 'd gates , the sullen drawbridge fall 
 file thro and form within the sounding wall 
 the britons strike their flag , the fort forgo 
 descend sad prisoners to the plain below 
 a thousand veterans , ere the morning rose 
 received their handcuffs from five hundred foes 
 and stonypoint beheld , with dawning day 
 his own starr 'd standard on his rampart play 

then arthur rose and lancelot followed him 
 and while they stood without the doors , the king 
 turned to him saying , ‘ is it then so well 
 or mine the blame that oft i seem as he 
 of whom was written , “ a sound is in his ears 
 the foot that loiters , bidden go ,— the glance 
 that only seems half loyal to command 
 a manner somewhat fallen from reverence 
 or have i dreamed the bearing of our knights 
 tells of a manhood ever less and lower 
 or whence the fear lest this my realm , upreared 
 by noble deeds at one with noble vows 
 from flat confusion and brute violences 
 reel back into the beast , and be no more 

he needs no praise of us , who wrought so well 
 who has the master 's praise ; who at his post 
 stood to the last . yet , now , from coast to coast 
 let memory of him peal like some great bell 
 of him as woodsman , workman , let it tell 
 of him as lawyer , statesman , without boast 
 and for what qualities we love him most 
 and recollections that no time can quell 
 he needs no praise of us , yet let us praise 
 albeit his simple soul we may offend 
 that liked not praise , being most diffident 
 still let us praise him , praise him in such ways 
 as his were , and in words that shall transcend 
 marble , and outlast any monument

it was a land of plenty and of wealth 
 there god 's indulgent hand made for a race 
 supremely blest a paradise on earth 
 a land of virtue , truth , and charity 
 where nature 's choicest treasures man enjoyed 
 with little toil , where youth respected age 
 where each his neighbour 's wife his sister deemed 
 where side by side the tiger and the lamb 
 the water drank , and sported oft in mirth 
 a land where each man deemed him highly blest 
 when he relieved the miseries of the poor 
 when to his roof the wearied traveller came 
 to share his proffered bounty with good cheer 
 such was the far famed land of panchala 

oh , cruel liquor ! thou hast millions slain 
 and still their death throes cry to thee in vain 
 ten thousand broken hearts may soon be found 
 in almost every land the world around 
 millions of orphans ’ cries thine ears assail 
 while parents ’ early death they loud bewail 
 the prisons and asylums which we build 
 from thy sad victims ’ ranks are chiefly filled 
 war 's dreadful ravages are justly blamed 
 but war with thee deserves not to be named 
 and still , insatiate monster ! thy dread jaws 
 are daily filled — being unrestrained by laws 
 when will the day , the happy day , arrive

i wrote in mirrha 's bark , and as i wrote 
 poor mirrha wept because i wrote forsaken 
 ‘ twas of thy pride i sung in weeping note 
 when as her leaves great moan for pity maken 
 the falling fountains from the mountains falling 
 cried out , alas , so fair and be so cruel 
 and babbling echo never ceas è d calling 
 phillis , disdain is fit for none but truthless 
 the rising pines wherein i had engraved 
 thy memory consulting with the wind 
 are trucemen to thy heart and thoughts depraved 
 and say , thy kind should not be so unkind 
 but , out alas ! so fell is phillis fearless 
 that she hath made her damon well nigh tearless 

from yonder realms of empyrean day 
 bursts on my ear the indignant lay 
 there sit the sainted sage , the bard divine 
 the few whom genius gave to shine 
 through every unborn age and undiscover 'd clime 
 rapt in celestial transport they 
 yet hither oft a glance from high 
 they send of tender sympathy 
 to bless the place where on their opening soul 
 first the genuine ardour stole 
 ‘ twas milton struck the deep toned shell 
 and , as the choral warblings round him swell 
 meek newton 's self bends from his state sublime 
 and nods his hoary head , and listens to the rhyme 

no sooner ceased the sound , than i beheld 
 four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps 
 of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad 
 when thus my master kind began : “ mark him 
 who in his right hand bears that falchion keen 
 the other three preceding , as their lord 
 this is that homer , of all bards supreme 
 flaccus the next , in satire 's vein excelling 
 the third is naso ; lucan is the last 
 because they all that appellation own 
 with which the voice singly accosted me 
 honouring they greet me thus , and well they judge 
 so i beheld united the bright school 
 of him the monarch of sublimest song 

if faithful souls be alike glorified 
 as angels , then my father 's soul doth see 
 and adds this even to full felicity 
 that valiantly i hell 's wide mouth o'erstride 
 but if our minds to these souls be descried 
 by circumstances and by signs that be 
 apparent in us not immediately 
 how shall my mind 's white truth by them be tried 
 they see idolatrous lovers weep and mourn 
 and style blasphemous conjurors to call 
 on jesus ’ name , and pharisaical 
 dissemblers feign devotion . then turn 
 o pensive soul ! to god , for he knows best 
 thy grief , for he put it into my breast 

i went to listen to my teacher friend 
 o friend above , thanks for the friend below 
 who having been made wise , deep things to know 
 with brooding spirit over them doth bend 
 until they waken words , as wings , to send 
 their seeds far forth , seeking a place to grow 
 the lesson past , with quiet foot i go 
 and towards his silent room , expectant wend 
 seeking a blessing , even leave to dwell 
 for some eternal minutes in his eyes 
 and he smiled on me in his loving wise 
 his hand spoke friendship , satisfied me well 
 my presence was some pleasure , i could tell 
 then forth we went beneath the smoky skies 

how can i woo you in this ancient suit 
 you do not notice it , of course ; i know it 
 my soul is burdened with a shapeless boot 
 your heart is singing welcome to your poet 
 here in the shadowy settle i can sit 
 and sparkle with you , brightly confidential 
 but when into the lamp bright zone you flit 
 i shrink into some corner penitential 
 a well dressed crowd , their tailors all unpaid 
 throng round you there , and cuffs and collars glisten 
 of pity 's blindness , as of scorn , afraid 
 i shun the merry fray , and darkling listen 
 for who could urge the timidest of suits 
 conscious of such indifferent clothes and boots 

i saw a spring out of a rocke forth rayle 
 as cleare as christall gainst the sunnie beames 
 the bottome yeallow , like the golden grayle 
 that bright pactolus washeth with his streames 
 it seem 'd that art and nature had assembled 
 all pleasure there for which mans hart could long 
 and there a noyse alluring sleepe soft trembled 
 of manie accords , more sweete than mermaids song 
 the seates and benches shone as yvorie 
 and hundred nymphes sate side by side about 
 when from nigh hills , with hideous outcrie 
 a troupe of satyres in the place did rout 
 which with their villeine feete the streame did ray 
 threw down the seats , and drove the nymphs away 

no ; cast by fortune on a frowning coast 
 which neither groves nor happy valleys boast 
 where other cares than those the muse relates 
 and other shepherds dwell with other mates 
 by such examples taught , i paint the cot 
 as truth will paint it and as bards will not 
 nor you , ye poor , of lettered scorn complain 
 to you the smoothest song is smooth in vain 
 o'ercome by labour and bowed down by time 
 feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme 
 can poets soothe you , when you pine for bread 
 by winding myrtles round your ruined shed 
 can their light tales your weighty griefs o'erpower 
 or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour 

the latian virgins , valiant with despair 
 arm 'd on the tow'rs , the common danger share 
 so much of zeal their country 's cause inspir 'd 
 so much camilla 's great example fir 'd 
 poles , sharpen 'd in the flames , from high they throw 
 with imitated darts , to gall the foe 
 their lives for godlike freedom they bequeath 
 and crowd each other to be first in death 
 meantime to turnus , ambush 'd in the shade 
 with heavy tidings came th ’ unhappy maid 
 “ the volscians overthrown , camilla kill 'd 
 the foes , entirely masters of the field 
 like a resistless flood , come rolling on 
 the cry goes off the plain , and thickens to the town 

immortal eloquence of mystic art 
 how strangely o'er oblivion and gray time 
 that hand doth speak , as in the painter 's prime 
 it uttered thus his own and mary 's heart 
 at sight of it , what rich conjectures start 
 adown the years , what wistful aves chime 
 that wake the soul to rapture how sublime 
 wherewith we , too , must bear in him our part 
 for unto each to bring redemption 's share 
 whereby adown the ages christ is borne 
 there comes the angel of the lilied rod 
 and though our souls with anguish sore are torn 
 we pray once more the world o'ercoming prayer 
 and then is born in us the word of god 

when flora fair the pleasant tidings bringeth 
 of summer sweet with herbs and flowers adorn è d 
 the nightingale upon the hawthorn singeth 
 and boreas ’ blasts the birds and beasts have scorn è d 
 when fresh aurora with her colours painted 
 mingled with spears of gold , the sun appearing 
 delights the hearts that are with love acquainted 
 and maying maids have then their time of cheering 
 all creatures then with summer are delighted 
 the beasts , the birds , the fish with scale of silver 
 then stately dames by lovers are invited 
 to walk in meads or row upon the river 
 i all alone am from these joys exil è d 
 no summer grows where love yet never smil è d 

then all the lords and ladies rubbed their eyes 
 and slowly roused themselves from dumb surprise 
 the great hall echoed once more with the clatter 
 of laughing men 's and frightened women 's chatter 
 but gawayne , with the axe in hand , stood still 
 heedless of what was passing , with no will 
 for life or death , for all that made life dear 
 was fled like summer when the leaves fall sere 
 and arthur spoke , misreading gawayne 's thought 
 “ heaven send we have not all too dearly bought 
 our evening 's pastime , gawayne . you have done 
 as fits a fearless knight , and nobly won 
 our thanks in equal measure with our praise 
 be both remembered in the after days 

the sire return 'd : my great desire you know 
 to shield from slaughter and preserve the foe 
 in bands of concord all their tribes to bind 
 and live the friend and guardian of mankind 
 should strife begin , thy youthful arm shall share 
 the toils of glory thro the walks of war 
 but o'er their hills to seek alone the foes 
 to gain their confidence or brave their blows 
 bend their proud souls to reason 's voice divine 
 claims hardier limbs and riper years than thine 
 yet one of heavenly race the task requires 
 whose mystic rites control the solar fires 
 so the sooth 'd godhead proves to faithless eyes 
 his love to man , his empire of the skies 

such gifts are sweetest when unsought . to me 
 as i was loitering lately in my dreams 
 passing from one remembrance to another 
 like him who reads upon an outstretched map 
 content and idly happy , these rose up 
 out of that magic well stored picture house 
 no dream , rather a thing most keenly real 
 the memory of a moment , when with feet 
 arrested and spell bound , and captured eyes 
 made wide with joy and wonder , i beheld 
 the spaces of a white and wintery land 
 swept with the fire of sunset , all its width 
 vale , forest , town , and misty eminence 
 a miracle of color and of beauty 

in sunday school engaged twice each lord 's day 
 and hearing three discourses , some would say 
 no time could then remain for aught beside 
 but this , my friends , has only to be tried 
 for cooper , in reserve , two hours still kept 
 an elder 's invitation to accept 
 him to accompany to his home , and there 
 join in sweet conversation , hymn or prayer 
 thus mostly passed his sabbaths for two years 
 which kept him free from many doubts and fears 
 enabled him to work at business still 
 with easy mind , and with right hearty will 
 and find that wisdom 's ways are pleasantness 
 while all her paths are peace and heart felt bliss 

england ! the time is come when thou shouldst wean 
 thy heart from its emasculating food 
 the truth should now be better understood 
 old things have been unsettled ; we have seen 
 fair seed time , better harvest might have been 
 but for thy trespasses ; and , at this day 
 if for greece , egypt , india , africa 
 aught good were destined , thou wouldst step between 
 england ! all nations in this charge agree 
 but worse , more ignorant in love and hate 
 far , far more abject is thine enemy 
 therefore the wise pray for thee , though the freight 
 of thy offences be a heavy weight 
 oh grief ! that earth 's best hopes rest all with thee 

the days pass by , empty of thought and will 
 his thought grows stagnant at its very springs 
 with every channel on the world of things 
 dammed up , and thus , by its long standing still 
 poisons itself and sickens to decay 
 all his high love for her , his fair desire 
 loses its light ; and a dull rancorous fire 
 burning darkness and bitterness that prey 
 upon his heart are left . his spirit burns 
 sometimes with hatred , or the hatred turns 
 to a fierce lust for her , more cruel than hate 
 till he is weary wrestling with its force 
 and evermore she haunts him , early and late 
 as pitilessly as an old remorse 

my angel sister , tho ’ thy lovely form 
 perish 'd in youth 's gay morning , yet is mine 
 this precious ringlet !— still the soft hairs shine 
 still glow the nut brown tints , all bright and warm 
 with sunny gleam !— alas ! each kindred charm 
 vanish 'd long since ; deep in the silent shrine 
 wither 'd to shapeless dust !— and of their grace 
 memory alone retains the faithful trace 
 dear lock , had thy sweet owner liv 'd , ere now 
 time on her brow had faded thee !— my care 
 screen 'd from the sun and dew thy golden glow 
 and thus her early beauty dost thou wear 
 thou all of that fair frame my love cou 'd save 
 from the resistless ravage of the grave 

“ for lo ! i haste to those remote abodes 
 where the great parents , ( sacred source of gods 
 ocean and tethys their old empire keep 
 on the last limits of the land and deep 
 in their kind arms my tender years were past 
 what time old saturn , from olympus cast 
 of upper heaven to jove resign ’ d the reign 
 whelm ’ d under the huge mass of earth and main 
 for strife , i hear , has made the union cease 
 which held so long that ancient pair in peace 
 what honour , and what love , shall i obtain 
 if i compose those fatal feuds again 
 once more their minds in mutual ties engage 
 and , what my youth has owed , repay their age 

yet take the colder copy from my hand 
 not for its own but for the master 's sake 
 take it , as thou , returning home , wilt take 
 from that divinest soft italian land 
 fixed shadows of the beautiful and grand 
 in sunless pictures that the sun doth make 
 reflections that may pleasant memories wake 
 of all that raffael touched , or angelo planned 
 as these may keep what memory else might lose 
 so may this photograph of verse impart 
 an image , though without the native hues 
 of calderon 's fire , and yet with calderon 's art 
 of what thou lovest through a kindred muse 
 that sings in heaven , yet nestles in the heart 

if thou hadst been a poet ! on my heart 
 the thought dashed . it recoiled , as , with the gift 
 light blinded , and joy saddened , so bereft 
 and the hot fountain tears , with sudden start 
 thronged to mine eyes , as if with that same smart 
 the husk of vision had in twain been cleft 
 its hidden soul in naked beauty left 
 and we beheld thee , nature , as thou art 
 o poet , poet , poet ! at thy feet 
 i should have lien , sainted with listening 
 my pulses answering aye , in rhythmic beat 
 each parting word that with melodious wing 
 moved on , creating still my being sweet 
 my soul thy harp , thy word the quivering string 

the time will come when a diviner flame 
 shall warm my breast to sing of c æ sar 's fame 
 meanwhile , permit that my preluding muse 
 in theban wars an humbler theme may choose 
 of furious hate surviving death she sings 
 a fatal throne to two contending kings 
 and funeral flames , that , parting wide in air 
 express the discord of the souls they bear 
 of towns dispeopled , and the wandering ghosts 
 of kings unburied in the wasted coasts 
 when dirce 's fountain blush 'd with grecian blood 
 and thetis , near ismenos ’ swelling flood 
 with dread beheld the rolling surges sweep 
 in heaps his slaughter 'd sons into the deep 

more she had spoke , but yawn 'd — all nature nods 
 what mortal can resist the yawn of gods

 the convocation gaped , but could not speak 
 lost was the nation 's sense , nor could be found 
 while the long solemn unison went round 
 wide , and more wide , it spread o'er all the realm 
 even palinurus nodded at the helm 
 the vapour mild o'er each committee crept 
 unfinish 'd treaties in each office slept 
 and chiefless armies dozed out the campaign 
 and navies yawn 'd for orders on the main 

and therefore if to love can be desert 
 i am not all unworthy . cheeks as pale 
 as these you see , and trembling knees that fail 
 to bear the burden of a heavy heart 
 this weary minstrel life that once was girt 
 to climb aornus , and can scarce avail 
 to pipe now ‘ gainst the valley nightingale 
 a melancholy music ,— why advert 
 to these things ? o beloved , it is plain 
 i am not of thy worth nor for thy place 
 and yet , because i love thee , i obtain 
 from that same love this vindicating grace 
 to live on still in love , and yet in vain 
 to bless thee , yet renounce thee to thy face 

the silent room , the heavy creeping shade 
 the dead that travel fast , the opening door 
 the murdered brother rising through the floor 
 the ghost 's white fingers on thy shoulders laid 
 and then the lonely duel in the glade 
 the broken swords , the stifled scream , the gore 
 thy grand revengeful eyes when all is o'er 
 these things are well enough ,— but thou wert made 
 for more august creation ! frenzied lear 
 should at thy bidding wander on the heath 
 with the shrill fool to mock him , romeo 
 for thee should lure his love , and desperate fear 
 pluck richard 's recreant dagger from its sheath 
 thou trumpet set for shakespeare 's lips to blow

why thus unjustly , say , my cruel fate 
 dost thou adjudge my luckless eyes and heart 
 the one to live exiled from that sweet smart 
 where th ’ other pines , imprisoned without date 
 my luckless eyes must never more debate 
 of those bright beams that eased my love apart 
 and yet my heart , bound to them with love 's dart 
 must there dwell ever to bemoan my state

 often they had my heart 's unquiet eased 
 or had my heart with banishment been blest

 but since these cross effects hath fortune wrought

 as are the deepest bottoms of the main 
 wheresoe'er you were , with you my love should go 
 were you the earth , dear love , and i the skies 
 my love should shine on you , like to the sun 
 and look upon you with ten thousand eyes

 wheresoe'er i am ,— below , or else above you 
 wheresoe'er you are , my heart shall truly love you

since there is no escape , since at the end 
 my body will be utterly destroyed 
 this hand i love as i have loved a friend 
 this body i tended , wept with and enjoyed 
 since there is no escape even for me 
 who love life with a love too sharp to bear 
 the scent of orchards in the rain , the sea 
 and hours alone too still and sure for prayer 
 since darkness waits for me , then all the more 
 let me go down as waves sweep to the shore 
 in pride ; and let me sing with my last breath 
 in these few hours of light i lift my head 
 life is my lover — i shall leave the dead 
 if there is any way to baffle death

 nor pleasure may to pleasure me dispose

 was never time gave term to my despite 
 nor joy that dried the tears of my lament 
 nor hold i hope of weal in memory 
 nor have i thought to change my restless grief 
 nor doth my conquest yield me sovereignty 
 nor hope repose , nor confidence relief 
 for why ? she sorts her frowns and favours so 
 as when i gain or lose i cannot know 

the sister nuns so vigilant had been 
 one night when darkness overspread the scene 
 and all was proper mysteries to hide 
 some words escaped her cell that doubts supplied 
 and other matters too were heard around 
 that in her breviary could not be found 
 ‘ tis her gallant ! said they : he 's clearly caught 
 alarm pervaded ; swarms were quickly brought 
 rage seemed to triumph ; sentinels were placed 
 the abbess too must know they were disgraced 
 away they hastened to convey surprise 
 and , thund'ring at her door , cried , madam rise 
 for sister isabella , in her cell 
 has got a man , which surely can n't be well 

dark and more dark the shades of evening fell 
 the wished for point was reached — but at an hour 
 when little could be gained from that rich dower 
 of prospect , whereof many thousands tell 
 yet did the glowing west with marvellous power 
 salute us ; there stood indian citadel 
 temple of greece , and minster with its tower 
 substantially expressed — a place for bell 
 or clock to toll from ! many a tempting isle 
 with groves that never were imagined , lay 
 ‘ mid seas how steadfast ! objects all for the eye 
 of silent rapture , but we felt the while 
 we should forget them ; they are of the sky 
 and from our earthly memory fade away 

his friends , for sure they well that title claim 
 first thought the licence of his tongue to blame 
 but , when they mark 'd how deeply he was mov 'd 
 they sooth 'd and cherish 'd rather than reprov 'd 
 each day , as mute he sat in desperate grief 
 they spoke kind words of comfort and relief 
 each day , howe'er they sought , howe'er they sued 
 scarce might they win his lips to taste of food 
 ‘ come , welcome death ! ’ forever was his cry 
 ‘ lo , here a wretch who wishes but to die 
 so still he wail 'd , till woe such mastery wan 
 they trembled for his nobler powers of man 
 they fear 'd lest reason 's tottering rule should end 
 and to a moping ideot sink their friend 

could'st thou resign the park and play , content 
 for the fair banks of severn or of trent 
 there might'st thou find some elegant retreat 
 some hireling senator 's deserted seat 
 and stretch thy prospects o'er the smiling land 
 for less than rent the dungeons of the strand 
 there prune thy walks , support thy drooping flowers 
 direct thy rivulets , and twine thy bowers 
 and , while thy grounds a cheap repast afford 
 despise the dainties of a venal lord 
 there every bush with nature 's music rings 
 there every breeze bears health upon its wings 
 on all thy hours security shall smile 
 and bless thine evening walk and morning toil 

upon an hill a bright flame i did see 
 waving aloft with triple point to skie 
 which , like incense of precious cedar tree 
 with balmie odours fil 'd th'ayre farre and nie 
 a bird all white , well feathered on each wing 
 hereout up to the throne of gods did flie 
 and all the way most pleasant notes did sing 
 whilst in the smoake she unto heaven did stie 
 of this faire fire the scattered rayes forth threw 
 on everie side a thousand shining beames 
 when sudden dropping of a silver dew 
 ( o grievous chance !) gan quench those precious flames 
 that it , which earst ** so pleasant sent did yeld 
 of nothing now but noyous sulphure smeld 

yet in the darksome crypt i left so late 
 whose only altar is its rusted grate 
 sepulchral , rayless , joyless as it seems 
 shamed by the glare of may 's refulgent beams 
 while the dim seasons dragged their shrouded train 
 its paler splendors were not quite in vain 
 from these dull bars the cheerful firelight 's glow 
 streamed through the casement o'er the spectral snow 
 here , while the night wind wreaked its frantic will 
 on the loose ocean and the rock bound hill 
 rent the cracked topsail from its quivering yard 
 and rived the oak a thousand storms had scarred 
 fenced by these walls the peaceful taper shone 
 nor felt a breath to slant its trembling cone 

fair art thou , phillis , ay , so fair , sweet maid 
 as nor the sun , nor i have seen more fair 
 for in thy cheeks sweet roses are embayed 
 and gold more pure than gold doth gild thy hair 
 sweet bees have hived their honey on thy tongue 
 and hebe spiced her nectar with thy breath 
 about thy neck do all the graces throng 
 and lay such baits as might entangle death 
 in such a breast what heart would not be thrall 
 from such sweet arms who would not wish embraces 
 at thy fair hands who wonders not at all 
 wonder itself through ignorance embases 
 yet natheless though wondrous gifts you call these 
 my faith is far more wonderful than all these 

we soon approach 'd it . o thou lombard spirit 
 how didst thou stand , in high abstracted mood 
 scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes

 eyeing us as a lion on his watch 
 but virgil with entreaty mild advanc 'd 
 requesting it to show the best ascent 
 it answer to his question none return 'd 
 but of our country and our kind of life 
 demanded . when my courteous guide began 
 “ mantua , ” the solitary shadow quick 
 rose towards us from the place in which it stood 
 and cry 'd , “ mantuan ! i am thy countryman

 what wondrous vertue is contayn 'd in you

 into the obiect of your mighty view 
 for when ye mildly looke with lovely hew 
 then is my soule with life and love inspired

stern diomed with either ajax stood 
 and great ulysses , bathed in hostile blood 
 embodied close , the labouring grecian train 
 the fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain 
 unmoved and silent , the whole war they wait 
 serenely dreadful , and as fix ’ d as fate 
 so when the embattled clouds in dark array 
 along the skies their gloomy lines display 
 when now the north his boisterous rage has spent 
 and peaceful sleeps the liquid element 
 the low hung vapours , motionless and still 
 rest on the summits of the shaded hill 
 till the mass scatters as the winds arise 
 dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies 

the sea is never quiet : east and west 
 the nations hear it , like the voice of fate 
 within vast shores its strife makes desolate 
 still murmuring mid storms that to its breast 
 return , as eagles screaming to their nest 
 is it the voice of worlds and isles that wait 
 while old earth crumbles to eternal rest 
 or some hoar monster calling to his mate 
 o ye , that hear it moan about the shore 
 be still and listen ! that loud voice hath sung 
 where mountains rise , where desert sands are blown 
 and when man 's voice is dumb , forevermore 
 ‘ twill murmur on its craggy shores among 
 singing of gods and nations overthrown 

when , looking on the present face of things 
 i see one man , of men the meanest too 
 rais 'd up to sway the world , to do , undo 
 with mighty nations for his underlings 
 the great events with which old story rings 
 seem vain and hollow ; i find nothing great 
 nothing is left which i can venerate 
 so that almost a doubt within me springs 
 of providence , such emptiness at length 
 seems at the heart of all things . but , great god 
 i measure back the steps which i have trod 
 and tremble , seeing , as i do , the strength 
 of such poor instruments , with thoughts sublime 
 i tremble at the sorrow of the time 

“ the branching forehead with diverging horns 
 crests the bold bull , the jealous stag adorns 
 fierce rival boars with side long fury wield 
 the pointed tusk , and guard with shoulder shield 
 bounds the dread tiger o'er the affrighted heath 
 arm 'd with sharp talons , and resistless teeth 
 the pouncing eagle bears in clinched claws 
 the struggling lamb , and rends with ivory jaws 
 the tropic eel , electric in his ire 
 alarms the waves with unextinguish 'd fire 
 the fly of night illumes his airy way 
 and seeks with lucid lamp his sleeping prey 
 fierce on his foe the poisoning serpent springs 
 and insect armies dart their venom 'd stings 

“ trojans and lycians , and ye dardans , fam 'd

 at ajax , as he spoke , his gleaming spear 
 he threw , but miss 'd his aim ; yet lycophron 
 his comrade , of cythera , mastor 's son 
 ( who flying from cythera 's lovely isle 
 with guilt of bloodshed , near to ajax dwelt

thee i invoke , the lord of life and light 
 beyond imagination pure and bright 
 to thee , sufficing praise no tongue can give 
 we are thy creatures , and in thee we live 
 thou art the summit , depth , the all in all 
 creator , guardian of this earthly ball 
 whatever is , thou art — protector , king 
 from thee all goodness , truth , and mercy spring 
 o pardon the misdeeds of him who now 
 bends in thy presence with a suppliant brow 
 teach them to tread the path thy prophet trod 
 to wash his heart from sin , to know his god 
 and gently lead him to that home of rest 
 where filled with holiest rapture dwell the blest 

if modest youth , with cool reflection crown 'd 
 and every opening virtue blooming round 
 could save a parent 's justest pride from fate 
 or add one patriot to a sinking state

 or sadly told how many hopes lie here 
 the living virtue now had shone approved 
 the senate heard him , and his country loved 
 yet softer honours , and less noisy fame 
 attend the shade of gentle buckingham 
 in whom a race , for courage famed and art 
 ends in the milder merit of the heart 
 and chiefs or sages long to britain given 
 pays the last tribute of a saint to heaven 

then was the faire dodonian tree far seene 
 upon seaven hills to spread his gladsome gleame 
 and conquerours bedecked with his greene 
 along the bancks of the ausonian streame 
 there many an auncient trophee was addrest 
 and many a spoyle , and many a goodly show 
 which that brave races greatnes did attest 
 that whilome from the troyan blood did flow 
 ravisht i was so rare a thing to vew 
 when lo ! a barbarous troupe of clownish fone 
 the honour of these noble boughs down threw 
 under the wedge i heard the tronck to grone

 a twinne of forked trees send forth againe 

are we , then , wholly fallen ? can it be 
 that thou , north wind , that from thy mountains bringest 
 their spirit to our plains , and thou , blue sea 
 who on our rocks thy wreaths of freedom flingest 
 as on an altar ,— can it be that ye 
 have wasted inspiration on dead ears 
 dulled with the too familiar clank of chains 
 the people 's heart is like a harp for years 
 hung where some petrifying torrent rains 
 its slow incrusting spray : the stiffened chords 
 faint and more faint make answer to the tears 
 that drip upon them : idle are all words 
 only a golden plectrum wakes the tone 
 deep buried ‘ neath that ever thickening stone 

instant the queen , observant of the king 
 commands her train a spacious vase to bring 
 the spacious vase with ample streams suffice 
 heap the high wood , and bid the flames arise 
 the flames climb round it with a fierce embrace 
 the fuming waters bubble o'er the blaze 
 herself the chest prepares ; in order roll 'd 
 the robes , the vests are ranged , and heaps of gold 
 and adding a rich dress inwrought with art 
 a gift expressive of her bounteous heart 
 thus spoke to ithacus : “ to guard with bands 
 insolvable these gifts , thy care demands 
 lest , in thy slumbers on the watery main 
 the hand of rapine make our bounty vain 

i know myself . not servile for applause 
 my muse permits no deprecating clause 
 modest or vain , she will not be denied 
 one bold confession due to honest pride 
 and well she knows the drooping veil of song 
 shall save her boldness from the caviller 's wrong 
 her sweeter voice the heavenly maid imparts 
 to tell the secrets of our aching hearts 
 for this , a suppliant , captive , prostrate , bound 
 she kneels imploring at the feet of sound 
 for this , convulsed in thought 's maternal pains 
 she loads her arms with rhyme 's resounding chains 
 faint though the music of her fetters be 
 it lends one charm ,— her lips are ever free

 can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure 
 the which he will not every hour survey 
 for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure 
 therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare 
 since seldom coming in that long year set 
 like stones of worth they thinly placed are 
 or captain jewels in the carcanet 
 so is the time that keeps you as my chest 
 or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide 
 to make some special instant special blest 
 by new unfolding his imprisoned pride 
 blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope 
 being had to triumph , being lacked to hope 

hearkening to her they called their sire to mind 
 his deeds for helen 's sake , and how the sons 
 of zeus the thunderer in the old time smote 
 aphidnae , when , because these were but babes 
 their nurses hid them far from peril of fight 
 and aethra they remembered — all she endured 
 through wars , as mother in law at first , and thrall 
 thereafter of helen . dumb for joy were they 
 till spake demophoon to that wistful one 
 “ even now the gods fulfil thine heart 's desire 
 we whom thou seest are the sons of him 
 thy noble son : thee shall our loving hands 
 bear to the ships : with joy to hellas ’ soil

 achilles wrought amid the trojan host 

the prayers i make will then be sweet indeed 
 if thou the spirit give by which i pray 
 my unassisted heart is barren clay 
 which of its native self can nothing feed 
 of good and pious works thou art the seed 
 which quickens only where thou say'st it may 
 unless thou shew to us thine own true way 
 no man can find it : father ! thou must lead 
 do thou , then , breathe those thoughts into my mind 
 by which such virtue may in me be bred 
 that in thy holy footsteps i may tread 
 the fetters of my tongue do thou unbind 
 that i may have the power to sing of thee 
 and sound thy praises everlastingly 

in quest of peace great montezuma stands 
 a sovereign supplicant with lifted hands 
 brings all his treasure , yields the regal sway 
 bids vassal millions their new lord obey 
 and plies the victor with incessant prayer 
 thro ravaged realms the harmless race to spare 
 but treasures , tears and sceptres plead in vain 
 nor threats can move him , nor a world restrain 
 while blind religion 's prostituted name 
 and monkish fury guide the sacred flame 
 o'er crowded fanes their fires unhallow 'd bend 
 climb the wide roofs , the lofty towers ascend 
 pour thro the lowering skies the smoky flood 
 and stain the fields , and quench the blaze in blood 

the good shah akbar ( peace be his alway 
 came forth from the divan at close of day 
 bowed with the burden of his many cares 
 worn with the hearing of unnumbered prayers 
 wild cries for justice , the importunate 
 appeals of greed and jealousy and hate 
 and all the strife of sect and creed and rite 
 santon and gouroo waging holy fight 
 for the wise monarch , claiming not to be 
 allah 's avenger , left his people free 
 with a faint hope , his book scarce justified 
 that all the paths of faith , though severed wide 
 o'er which the feet of prayerful reverence passed 
 met at the gate of paradise at last 

when i consider how my light is spent 
 ere half my days , in this dark world and wide 
 and that one talent which is death to hide 
 lodg 'd with me useless , though my soul more bent 
 to serve therewith my maker , and present 
 my true account , lest he , returning , chide 
 doth god exact day labour , light denied 
 i fondly ask : but patience , to prevent 
 that murmur , soon replies , god doth not need 
 either man 's work , or his own gifts ; who best 
 bear his mild yoke , they serve him best ; his state 
 is kingly ; thousands at his bidding speed 
 and post o'er land and ocean without rest 
 they also serve who only stand and wait

 or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie 
 or wedged whole ages in a bodkin 's eye 
 gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain 
 while clogged he beats his silken wings in vain 
 or alum styptics with contracting power 
 shrink his thin essence like a rivelled flower 
 or , as ixion fixed , the wretch shall feel 
 the giddy motion of the whirling mill 
 in fumes of burning chocolate shall glow

 a deal of youth , ere this , is come 
 back , and with white thorn laden home 
 some have despatched their cakes and cream 
 before that we have left to dream 
 and some have wept , and wooed and plighted troth 
 and chose their priest , ere we can cast off sloth 
 many a green gown has been given 
 many a kiss , both odd and even

 poor child , and be not to thyself abhorred

 and the long strips of river silver flow

 drinking their lips , catch thou the dream in flight 
 about their fragile hairs ’ aerial gold 
 thou art divine , thou livest , — as of old 
 apollo springing naked to the light 
 and all his island shivered into flowers 

to him the monarch : “ just is thy decree 
 thy words give joy , and wisdom breathes in thee 
 each due atonement gladly i prepare 
 and heaven regard me as i justly swear 
 here then awhile let greece assembled stay 
 nor great achilles grudge this short delay 
 till from the fleet our presents be convey ’ d 
 and jove attesting , the firm compact made 
 a train of noble youths the charge shall bear 
 these to select , ulysses , be thy care 
 in order rank ’ d let all our gifts appear 
 and the fair train of captives close the rear 
 talthybius shall the victim boar convey 
 sacred to jove , and yon bright orb of day 

the grecian muse has all their gods survived 
 nor jove at us , nor phoebus is arrived 
 frail deities ! which first the poets made 
 and then invoked , to give their fancies aid 
 yet if they still divert us with their rage 
 what may be hoped for in a better age 
 when not from helicon 's imagined spring 
 but sacred writ , we borrow what we sing 
 this with the fabric of the world begun 
 elder than light , and shall outlast the sun 
 before this oracle , like dagon , all 
 the false pretenders , delphos , ammon , fall 
 long since despised and silent , they afford 
 honour and triumph to th'eternal word 

how into worthless lead pure gold is changed 
 who is that priest slain in the holy place 
 weep , weep jerusalem , perfidious city 
 wretched destroyer of the sacred seers 
 god of his love for thee divests himself 
 thy incense in his eyes is incense foul 
 where do you take those children and those wives 
 the queen of cities god has overthrown 
 her priests are captives , and her kings disowned 
 temple be overthrown ! cedars cast your flames 
 jerusalem , thou object of my grief 
 who in one day has ravished all thy charms 
 o who will change , to weep thy miseries 
 mine eyes to two fountains of tears 

good kosciusko , thy great name alone 
 is a full harvest whence to reap high feeling 
 it comes upon us like the glorious pealing 
 of the wide spheres — an everlasting tone 
 and now it tells me , that in worlds unknown 
 the names of heroes , burst from clouds concealing 
 and changed to harmonies , for ever stealing 
 through cloudless blue , and round each silver throne 
 it tells me too , that on a happy day 
 when some good spirit walks upon the earth 
 thy name with alfred 's , and the great of yore 
 gently commingling , gives tremendous birth 
 to a loud hymn , that sounds far , far away 
 to where the great god lives for evermore 

sol thro ’ white curtains shot a tim'rous ray 
 and oped those eyes that must eclipse the day 
 now lap dogs give themselves the rousing shake 
 and sleepless lovers , just at twelve , awake 
 thrice rung the bell , the slipper knock 'd the ground 
 and the press 'd watch return 'd a silver sound 
 belinda still her downy pillow prest 
 her guardian sylph prolong 'd the balmy rest 
 ‘ twas he had summon 'd to her silent bed 
 the morning dream that hover 'd o'er her head 
 a youth more glitt'ring than a birth night beau 
 ( that ev'n in slumber caus 'd her cheek to glow 
 seem 'd to her ear his winning lips to lay 
 and thus in whispers said , or seem 'd to say 

and beatrice : “ the first diving soul 
 that ever the first virtue fram 'd , admires 
 within these rays his maker . ” like the leaf 
 that bows its lithe top till the blast is blown 
 by its own virtue rear 'd then stands aloof 
 so i , the whilst she said , awe stricken bow 'd 
 then eagerness to speak embolden 'd me 
 and i began : “ o fruit ! that wast alone 
 mature , when first engender 'd ! ancient father 
 that doubly seest in every wedded bride 
 thy daughter by affinity and blood 
 devoutly as i may , i pray thee hold 
 converse with me : my will thou seest ; and i 
 more speedily to hear thee , tell it not 

if laura — lady of the flower soft face 
 should light upon these verses , she may take 
 the tenderest line , and through its pulses trace 
 what man can suffer for a woman 's sake 
 for in the nights that burn , the days that break 
 a thin pale figure stands in passion 's place 
 and peace comes not , nor yet the perished grace 
 of youth , to keep old faiths and fires awake 
 ah ! marvellous maid . life sobs , and sighing saith 
 “ she left me , fleeting like a fluttered dove 
 but i would have a moment of her breath 
 so i might taste the sweetest sense thereof 
 and catch from blossoming , honeyed lips of love 
 some faint , some fair , some dim , delicious death 

since we must sleep the endless sleep at last 
 since life 's grim juggernaut ‘ neath ruthless wheels 
 crushes the heart ; since age like winter steals 
 on youth 's fair flowered fields with blighting blast 
 then to the gods our doubts and fears be cast 
 enough of sorrow ! joyance is our due 
 gather the roses ! spurn th ’ envenomed rue 
 fling to the waiting winds the pallid past 
 steep thee in mellow moods and dear desires 
 pluck love 's flame hearted flower ere it dies 
 cull nectared kisses sweet as morning 's breath 
 warm chastity at passion 's purple fires 
 nepenthe quaff — till drained the chalice lies 
 after ... the shrouded sleep , the dreamless dark of death 

the weary old year is dead at last 
 his corpse ‘ mid the ruins of time is cast 
 where the mouldering wrecks of lost thought lie 
 and the rich hued blossoms of passion die 
 to a withering grass that droops o'er his grave 
 the shadowy titan 's refuge cave 
 strange lights from pale moony memory lie 
 on the weedy columns beneath its eye 
 and strange is the sound of the ghostlike breeze 
 in the lingering leaves on the skeleton trees 
 and strange is the sound of the falling shower 
 when the clouds of dead pain o'er the spirit lower 
 unheard in the home he inhabiteth 
 the land where all lost things are gathered by death 

my poet , thou canst touch on all the notes 
 god set between his after and before 
 and strike up and strike off the general roar 
 of the rushing worlds a melody that floats 
 in a serene air purely . antidotes 
 of medicated music , answering for 
 mankind 's forlornest uses , thou canst pour 
 from thence into their ears . god 's will devotes 
 thine to such ends , and mine to wait on thine 
 how , dearest , wilt thou have me for most use 
 a hope , to sing by gladly ? or a fine 
 sad memory , with thy songs to interfuse 
 a shade , in which to sing — of palm or pine 
 a grave , on which to rest from singing ? choose 

when in the widening circle of rebirth 
 to a new flesh my travelled soul shall come 
 and try again the unremembered earth 
 with the old sadness for the immortal home 
 shall i revisit these same differing fields 
 and cull the old new flowers with the same sense 
 that some small breath of foiled remembrance yields 
 of more age than my days in this pretence 
 shall i again regret strange faces lost 
 of which the present memory is forgot 
 and but in unseen bulks of vagueness tossed 
 out of the closed sea and black night of thought 
 were thy face one , what sweetness will ’ t not be 
 though by blind feeling , to remember thee 

six thousand years of commune , god with man 
 two thousand years of ohrist ; yet from such roots 
 immortal , earth reaps only bitterest fruits 
 the fiends rage now as when they first began 
 hate , lust , greed , vanity , triumphant still 
 yell , shout , exult , and lord o'er human will 
 the sun moves back ! the fond convictions felt 
 that , in the progress of the race , we stood 
 two thousand years of height above the flood 
 before the day 's experience sink and melt 
 as frost beneath the fire ! and what remains 
 of all our grand ideals and great gains 
 with goth , hun , vandal , warring in their pride 
 while the meek christ is hourly crucified 

impelled by feelings in their nature kind 
 but slightly weak and somewhat undefined 
 rush at each other , make a sudden stand 
 begin to talk , expatiate , and expand 
 each looks quite radiant , seems extremely struck 
 their meeting so was such a piece of luck 
 each thinks the other thinks he ‘ s greatly pleased 
 to screw the vice in which they both are squeezed 
 so there they talk , in dust , or mud , or snow 
 both bored to death , and both afraid to go 
 your hat once lifted , do not hang your fire 
 nor , like slow ajax , fighting still , retire 
 when your old castor on your crown you clap 
 go off ; you 've mounted your percussion cap 

those pretty wrongs that liberty commits 
 when i am sometime absent from thy heart 
 thy beauty , and thy years full well befits 
 for still temptation follows where thou art 
 gentle thou art , and therefore to be won 
 beauteous thou art , therefore to be assailed 
 and when a woman woos , what woman 's son 
 will sourly leave her till he have prevailed 
 ay me , but yet thou mightst my seat forbear 
 and chide thy beauty , and thy straying youth 
 who lead thee in their riot even there 
 where thou art forced to break a twofold truth 
 hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee 
 thine by thy beauty being false to me 

me doubt possess 'd , and “ speak , ” it whisper 'd me 
 “ speak , speak unto thy lady , that she quench 
 thy thirst with drops of sweetness . ” yet blank awe 
 which lords it o'er me , even at the sound 
 of beatrice 's name , did bow me down 
 as one in slumber held . not long that mood 
 beatrice suffer 'd : she , with such a smile 
 as might have made one blest amid the flames 
 beaming upon me , thus her words began 
 “ thou in thy thought art pond'ring ( as i deem 
 and what i deem is truth how just revenge 
 could be with justice punish 'd : from which doubt 
 i soon will free thee ; so thou mark my words 
 for they of weighty matter shall possess thee 

the suffering chief at this began to melt 
 and , “ o eumaeus ! thou ( he cries ) hast felt 
 the spite of fortune too ! her cruel hand 
 snatch 'd thee an infant from thy native land 
 snatch 'd from thy parents ’ arms , thy parents ’ eyes 
 to early wants ! a man of miseries 
 the whole sad story , from its first , declare 
 sunk the fair city by the rage of war 
 where once thy parents dwelt ? or did they keep 
 in humbler life , the lowing herds and sheep 
 so left perhaps to tend the fleecy train 
 rude pirates seized , and shipp 'd thee o'er the main 
 doom 'd a fair prize to grace some prince 's board 
 the worthy purchase of a foreign lord 

these five kings said one to another 
 ‘ king unto king o'er the world is brother 
 seeing that now , for a sign and a wonder 
 a red eclipse and a tongue of thunder 
 a shape and a finger of desolation 
 is come against us a kingless nation 
 gibeon hath failed us : it were not good 
 that a man remember where gibeon stood 
 then gibeon sent to our captain , crying 
 ‘ son of nun , let a shaft be flying 
 for unclean birds are gathering greedily 
 slack not thy hand , but come thou speedily 
 yea , we are lost save thou maintain'st us 
 for the kings of the mountains are gathered against us 

“ all , all ( ulysses instant made reply 
 i tell thee all , my child , my only joy 
 phaeacians bore me to the port assign 'd 
 a nation ever to the stranger kind 
 wrapp 'd in the embrace of sleep , the faithful train 
 o'er seas convey 'd me to my native reign 
 embroider 'd vestures , gold , and brass , are laid 
 conceal 'd in caverns in the sylvan shade 
 hither , intent the rival rout to slay 
 and plan the scene of death , i bend my way 
 so pallas wills — but thou , my son , explain 
 the names and numbers of the audacious train 
 ‘ tis mine to judge if better to employ 
 assistant force , or singly to destroy 

as when above orchestral undertone 
 the plaining wail of muted violin 
 the hushed ob ö e and the distant din 
 of muffled drum or viol 's raucous groan 
 sudden arises one pure voice like tone 
 a silver trumpet 's tongue that stirs the soul 
 to feel the theme , and the harmonious whole 
 a sonant setting seems for that alone 
 so , high above earth 's murmurous stir and strife 
 riseth thy voice in clear enringing song 
 no minor plaint of dull despairing pain 
 but one true note of hope that bids us long 
 for higher things ; and all the din of life 
 seems to subserve the sweetness of thy strain 

once on the year 's last eve in my mind 's might 
 sitting in dreams , not sad , nor quite elysian 
 balancing all ‘ twixt wonder and derision 
 methought my body and all this world took flight 
 and vanished from me , as a dream , outright 
 leaning out thus in sudden strange decision 
 i saw as it were in the flashing of a vision 
 far down between the tall towers of the night 
 borne by great winds in awful unison 
 the teeming masses of mankind sweep by 
 even as a glittering river with deep sound 
 and innumerable banners , rolling on 
 over the starry border glooms that bound 
 the last gray space in dim eternity 

thou art the rock of empire , set mid seas 
 between the east and west , that god has built 
 advance thy roman borders where thou wilt 
 while run thy armies true with his decrees 
 law , justice , liberty — great gifts are these 
 watch that they spread where english blood is spilt 
 lest , mixed and sullied with his country 's guilt 
 the soldier 's life stream flow , and heaven displease 
 two swords there are : one naked , apt to smite 
 thy blade of war ; and , battle storied , one 
 rejoices in the sheath , and hides from light 
 american i am ; would wars were done 
 now westward , look , my country bids good night 
 peace to the world from ports without a gun 

victorious saw , when the seat he came near to 
 gold treasure sparkling spread on the bottom 
 wonder on the wall , and the worm creature 's cavern 
 the ancient dawn flier 's , vessels a standing 
 10 cups of the ancients of cleansers bereav è d 
 robbed of their ornaments : there were helmets in numbers 
 old and rust eaten , arm bracelets many 
 artfully woven . wealth can easily 
 gold on the sea bottom , turn into vanity 
 15 each one of earthmen , arm him who pleaseth 
 and he saw there lying an all golden banner 
 high o'er the hoard , of hand wonders greatest 
 link è d with lacets : a light from it sparkled 
 that the floor of the cavern he was able to look on 

so passed some days whose length and count we lost 
 our bitterest trial . then a respite came 
 one who had interest with the governor 
 wrought our removal daily for some hours 
 into an upper chamber , where we sat 
 and held each other 's hands in childish joy 
 receiving the sweet gift of light and air 
 with wonder and exceeding thankfulness 
 and then began that life of daily growth 
 in mutual exaltation and sweet help 
 that bore us as a gently widening stream 
 unto the ocean of our martyrdom 
 uniting all our feebler souls in one 
 a mightier — we reached forth with this to god 

since shunning pain , i ease can never find 
 since bashful dread seeks where he knows me harmed 
 since will is won , and stopped ears are charmed 
 since force doth faint , and sight doth make me blind 
 since loosing long , the faster still i bind 
 since naked sense can conquer reason armed 
 since heart , in chilling fear , with ice is warmed 
 in fine , since strife of thought but mars the mind 
 i yield , o love , unto thy loathed yoke 
 yet craving law of arms , whose rule doth teach 
 that , hardly used , who ever prison broke 
 in justice quit , of honour made no breach 
 whereas , if i a grateful guardian have 
 thou art my lord , and i thy vowed slave 

if e'er again return those awful days 
 whose clouds were crimsoned with the beacon 's blaze 
 whose grass was trampled by the soldier 's heel 
 whose tides were reddened round the rushing keel 
 god grant some lyre may wake a nobler strain 
 to rend the silence of our tented plain 
 when gallia 's flag its triple fold displays 
 her marshalled legions peal the marseillaise 
 when round the german close the war clouds dim 
 far through their shadows floats his battle hymn 
 when , crowned with joy , the camps ’ of england ring 
 a thousand voices shout , “ god save the king 
 when victory follows with our eagle 's glance 
 our nation 's anthem pipes a country dance 

when lost francesca sobbed her broken tale 
 of love and sin and boundless agony 
 while that wan spirit by her side did wail 
 and bite his lips for utter misery 
 the grief which could not speak , nor hear , nor see 
 so tender grew the superhuman face 
 of one who listened , that a mighty trace 
 of superhuman woe gave way , and pale 
 the sudden light up struggled to its place 
 while all his limbs began to faint and fail 
 with such excess of pity . but , behind 
 the roman virgil stood — the calm , the wise 
 with not a shadow in his regal eyes 
 a stately type of all his stately kind 

amid the florid multitude her face 
 was like the full moon seen behind the lace 
 of orchard boughs where clouded blossoms part 
 when spring shines in the world and in the heart 
 as the full moon beams to the ferny floor 
 of summer woods through flower and foliage pour 
 so to my being 's innermost recess 
 flooded the light of so much loveliness 
 she held as in a vase of priceless ware 
 the wine that over arid ways and bare 
 my youth was the pathetic thirsting for 
 and where she moved the veil of nature grew 
 diaphanous and that radiance mantled through 
 which , when i see , i tremble and adore 

then shall your works of art superior rise 
 your fruits perfume a larger length of skies 
 canals careering climb your sunbright hills 
 vein the green slopes and strow their nurturing rills 
 thro tunnel 'd heights and sundering ridges glide 
 rob the rich west of half kenhawa 's tide 
 mix your wide climates , all their stores confound 
 and plant new ports in every midland mound 
 your lawless missisippi , now who slimes 
 and drowns and desolates his waste of climes 
 ribb 'd with your dikes , his torrent shall restrain 
 and ask your leave to travel to the main 
 won from his wave while rising cantons smile 
 rear their glad nations and reward their toil 

now crowds on crowds around the goddess press 
 each eager to present the first address 
 dunce scorning dunce beholds the next advance 
 but fop shows fop superior complaisance 
 when , lo ! a spectre rose , whose index hand 
 held forth the virtue of the dreadful wand 
 his beaver 'd brow a birchen garland wears 
 dropping with infants ’ blood and mothers ’ tears 
 o'er every rein a shuddering horror runs 
 eton and winton shake through all their sons 
 all flesh is humbled , westminster 's bold race 
 shrink , and confess the genius of the place 
 the pale boy senator yet tingling stands 
 and holds his breeches close with both his hands 

continued john :— now i will thee instruct 
 the proper manner , matters to conduct 
 for thee to have a clever mare by day 
 and still at night a charming wife survey 
 face , legs , and ev'ry thing shall reappear 
 come , see it done , and i 'll perform it here 
 thou'lt then the method fully comprehend 
 but hold thy tongue , or all will quickly end 
 a single word the magick would dispel 
 and , during life , no more with us ‘ twould dwell 
 keep close thy mouth and merely ope ’ thy eyes 
 a glimpse alone to learn it will suffice 
 this o'er , thyself shall practise it the same 
 and all will follow as when first it came 

but hark !— from wood and rock flung back 
 what sound comes up the merrimac 
 what sea worn barks are those which throw 
 the light spray from each rushing prow 
 have they not in the north sea 's blast 
 bowed to the waves the straining mast 
 their frozen sails the low , pale sun 
 of thule 's night has shone upon 
 flapped by the sea wind 's gusty sweep 
 round icy drift , and headland steep 
 wild jutland 's wives and lochlin 's daughters 
 have watched them fading o'er the waters 
 lessening through driving mist and spray 
 like white winged sea birds on their way 

the sirens once were maidens innocent 
 that through the water meads with proserpine 
 plucked no fire hearted flowers , but were content 
 cool fritillaries and flag flowers to twine 
 with lilies woven and with wet woodbine 
 till once they sought the bright aetnaean flowers 
 and their bright mistress fled from summer hours 
 with hades , down the irremeable decline 
 and they have sought her all the wide world through 
 till many years , and wisdom , and much wrong 
 have filled and changed their song , and o'er the blue 
 rings deadly sweet the magic of the song 
 and whoso hears must listen till he die 
 far on the flowery shores of sicily 

and you as well must die , beloved dust 
 and all your beauty stand you in no stead 
 this flawless , vital hand , this perfect head 
 this body of flame and steel , before the gust 
 of death , or under his autumnal frost 
 shall be as any leaf , be no less dead 
 than the first leaf that fell ,— this wonder fled 
 altered , estranged , disintegrated , lost 
 nor shall my love avail you in your hour 
 in spite of all my love , you will arise 
 upon that day and wander down the air 
 obscurely as the unattended flower 
 it mattering not how beautiful you were 
 or how beloved above all else that dies 

now each partakes the feast , the wine prepares 
 portions the food , and each his portion shares 
 the bard a herald guides ; the gazing throng 
 pay low obeisance as he moves along 
 beneath a sculptur 'd arch he sits enthroned 
 the peers encircling form an awful round 
 then , from the chine , ulysses carves with art 
 delicious food , an honorary part 
 “ this , let the master of the lyre receive 
 a pledge of love ! ‘ tis all a wretch can give 
 lives there a man beneath the spacious skies 
 who sacred honours to the bard denies 
 the muse the bard inspires , exalts his mind 
 the muse indulgent loves the harmonious kind 

with these the martin readily concurr 'd 
 a church begot , and church believing bird 
 of little body , but of lofty mind 
 round bellied , for a dignity design 'd 
 and much a dunce , as martins are by kind 
 yet often quoted canon laws , and code 
 and fathers which he never understood 
 but little learning needs in noble blood 
 for , sooth to say , the swallow brought him in 
 her household chaplain , and her next of kin 
 in superstition silly to excess 
 and casting schemes by planetary guess 
 in fine , short wing 'd , unfit himself to fly 
 his fears foretold foul weather in the sky 

but when that goodly frame by ravening fire 
 was all consumed , they quenched the pyre with wine 
 they gathered up the bones , and reverently 
 laid in a golden casket . hard beside 
 rhoeteium 's headland heaped they up a mound 
 measureless high . then scattered they amidst 
 the long ships , heavy hearted for the man 
 whom they had honoured even as achilles 
 then black night , bearing unto all men sleep 
 upfloated : so they brake bread , and lay down 
 waiting the child of the mist . short was sleep 
 broken by fitful staring through the dark 
 haunted by dread lest in the night the foe 
 should fall on them , now telamon 's son was dead 

he had no children , who for love of men 
 being god , endured of gods such things as thou 
 father ; nor on his thunder beaten brow 
 fell such a woe as bows thine head again 
 twice bowed before , though godlike , in man 's ken 
 and seen too high for any stroke to bow 
 save this of some strange god 's that bends it now 
 the third time with such weight as bruised it then 
 fain would grief speak , fain utter for love 's sake 
 some word ; but comfort who might bid thee take 
 what god in your own tongue shall talk with thee 
 showing how all souls that look upon the sun 
 shall be for thee one spirit and thy son 
 and thy soul 's child the soul of man to be 

so was it done , and ogier , armed right well 
 sleeping , was borne away by some strong spell 
 and set upon the flemish coast ; and thence 
 turned to st. omer 's , with a doubtful sense 
 of being in some wild dream , the while he knew 
 that great delight forgotten was his due 
 that all which there might hap was of small worth 
 so on he went , and sometimes unto mirth 
 did his attire move the country folk 
 but oftener when strange speeches from him broke 
 concerning men and things for long years dead 
 he filled the listeners with great awe and dread 
 for in such wild times as these people were 
 are men soon moved to wonder and to fear 

there was a touching paleness on her face 
 which chased her smiles , but such sweet union made 
 of pensive majesty and heavenly grace 
 as if a passing cloud had veil 'd her with its shade 
 then knew i how the blessed ones above 
 gaze on each other in their perfect bliss 
 for never yet was look of mortal love 
 so pure , so tender , so serene as this 
 the softest glance fond woman ever sent 
 to him she loved , would cold and rayless be 
 compared to this , which she divinely bent 
 earthward , with angel sympathy , on me 
 that seem 'd with speechless tenderness to say 
 “ who takes from me my faithful friend away 

superb and sole , upon a plumed spray 
 that o'er the general leafage boldly grew 
 he summ 'd the woods in song ; or typic drew 
 the watch of hungry hawks , the lone dismay 
 of languid doves when long their lovers stray 
 and all birds ’ passion plays that sprinkle dew 
 at morn in brake or bosky avenue 
 what e'er birds did or dreamed , this bird could say 
 then down he shot , bounced airily along 
 the sward , twitched in a grasshopper , made song 
 midflight , perched , prinked , and to his art again 
 sweet science , this large riddle read me plain 
 how may the death of that dull insect be 
 the life of yon trim shakspere on the tree 

“ arise , depart , for this is not your rest 
 oh , burden of all burdens ,— still to arise 
 and still depart , nor rest in any wise 
 rolling , still rolling thus to east from west 
 earth journeys on her immemorial quest 
 whom a moon chases in no different guise 
 thus stars pursue their courses , and thus flies 
 the sun , and thus all creatures manifest 
 unrest , the common heritage , the ban 
 flung broadcast on all humankind ,— on all 
 who live ; for living , all are bound to die 
 that which is old , we know that it is man 
 these have no rest who sit and dream and sigh 
 nor have those rest who wrestle and who fall 

has she forgotten ? on this very may 
 we were to meet here , with the birds and bees 
 as on that sabbath , underneath the trees 
 we strayed among the tombs , and stripped away 
 the vines from these old granites , cold and gray 
 and yet indeed not grim enough were they 
 to stay our kisses , smiles and ecstasies 
 or closer voice lost vows and rhapsodies 
 has she forgotten — that the may has won 
 its promise ?— that the bird songs from the tree 
 are sprayed above the grasses as the sun 
 might jar the dazzling dew down showeringly 
 has she forgotten life — love — everyone 
 has she forgotten me — forgotten me 

as sheep , that step from forth their fold , by one 
 or pairs , or three at once ; meanwhile the rest 
 stand fearfully , bending the eye and nose 
 to ground , and what the foremost does , that do 
 the others , gath'ring round her , if she stops 
 simple and quiet , nor the cause discern 
 so saw i moving to advance the first 
 who of that fortunate crew were at the head 
 of modest mien and graceful in their gait 
 when they before me had beheld the light 
 from my right side fall broken on the ground 
 so that the shadow reach 'd the cave , they stopp 'd 
 and somewhat back retir 'd : the same did all 
 who follow 'd , though unweeting of the cause 

one time i wooed a maid ( dear is she yet 
 all in the revel eye of young love 's moon 
 content she made me ,— ah , my dimpling mate 
 my springtime girl , who walked with flower shoon 
 but near me , nearer , steals a deep eyed maid 
 with creeping glance that sees and will not see 
 and blush that would those yea sweet eyes upbraid 
 o , might i woo her nor inconstant be 
 but is not autumn dreamtime of the spring 
 ( yon scarlet fruit bell is a flower asleep 
 and i am not forsworn if yet i keep 
 dream faith with spring in autumn 's deeper kiss 
 then so , brown maiden , take this true love ring 
 and lay thy long , soft locks where my heart is 

i love to rise ere gleams the tardy light 
 winter 's pale dawn ;— and as warm fires illume 
 and cheerful tapers shine around the room 
 thro ’ misty windows bend my musing sight 
 where , round the dusky lawn , the mansions white 
 with shutters clos 'd , peer faintly thro ’ the gloom 
 that slow recedes ; while yon grey spires assume 
 rising from their dark pile , an added height 
 by indistinctness given .— then to decree 
 the grateful thoughts to god , ere they unfold 
 to friendship , or the muse , or seek with glee 
 wisdom 's rich page !— o , hours ! more worth than gold 
 by whose blest use we lengthen life , and free 
 from drear decays of age , outlive the old 

an only son he had — a noble prince 
 the terror of his foes , the poor man 's friend 
 he mastered all the arts of peace and war 
 and was a worthy father 's worthy son 
 what gifts and graces men as beauties deem 
 these nature freely lavished on the youth 
 and people loved in wonder to behold 
 the face that kindled pleasure in their minds 
 the courage of a warrior in the field 
 a woman 's tender pity to the weak 
 all these were centred in the royal youth 
 his arrows killed full many a beast that wrought 
 dread havoc on the cattle of the poor 
 such was the famous prince of panchala 

next , to the court , impatient of delay 
 with rapid step the goddess urged her way 
 there every eye with slumberous chains she bound 
 and dash 'd the flowing goblet to the ground

when i consider every thing that grows 
 holds in perfection but a little moment 
 that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows 
 whereon the stars in secret influence comment 
 when i perceive that men as plants increase 
 cheered and checked even by the self same sky 
 vaunt in their youthful sap , at height decrease 
 and wear their brave state out of memory 
 then the conceit of this inconstant stay 
 sets you most rich in youth before my sight 
 where wasteful time debateth with decay 
 to change your day of youth to sullied night 
 and all in war with time for love of you 
 as he takes from you , i engraft you new 

devoid of reason , thrall to foolish ire 
 i walk and chase a savage fairy still 
 now near the flood , straight on the mounting hill 
 now midst the woods of youth , and vain desire 
 for leash i bear a cord of careful grief 
 for brach i lead an over forward mind 
 my hounds are thoughts , and rage despairing blind 
 pain , cruelty , and care without relief 
 but they perceiving that my swift pursuit 
 my flying fairy cannot overtake 
 with open mouths their prey on me do make 
 like hungry hounds that lately lost their suit 
 and full of fury on their master feed 
 to hasten on my hapless death with speed 

when i behold this tickle * trustles state 
 of vaine worlds glorie , flitting too and fro 
 and mortall men tossed by troublous fate 
 in restles seas of wretchednes and woe 
 i wish i might this wearie life forgoe 
 and shortly turne unto my happie rest 
 where my free spirite might not anie moe 
 be vest with sights that doo her peace molest 
 and ye , faire ladie , in whose bounteous brest 
 all heavenly grace and vertue shrined is 
 when ye these rythmes doo read , and vew the rest 
 loath this base world , and thinke of heavens blis 
 and though ye be the fairest of gods creatures 
 yet thinke that death shall spoyle your goodly features 

this said , within her anxious mind she weighs 
 the means of cutting short her odious days 
 then to sichaeus ’ nurse she briefly said 
 ( for , when she left her country , hers was dead 
 “ go , barce , call my sister . let her care 
 the solemn rites of sacrifice prepare 
 the sheep , and all th ’ atoning off'rings bring 
 sprinkling her body from the crystal spring 
 with living drops ; then let her come , and thou 
 with sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow 
 thus will i pay my vows to stygian jove 
 and end the cares of my disastrous love

trained in the holy art whose lifted shield 
 wards off the darts a never slumbering foe

 the slayer 's weapon : on the murderous field 
 the fiery bolt he challenged laid him low

the worldly prince doth in his sceptre hold 
 a kind of heaven in his authorities 
 the wealthy miser , in his mass of gold 
 makes to his soul a kind of paradise 
 the epicure that eats and drinks all day 
 accounts no heaven , but in his hellish routs 
 and she , whose beauty seems a sunny day 
 makes up her heaven but in her baby 's clouts 
 but , my sweet god , i seek no prince 's power 
 no miser 's wealth , nor beauty 's fading gloss 
 which pamper sin , whose sweets are inward sour 
 and sorry gains that breed the spirit 's loss 
 no , my dear lord , let my heaven only be 
 in my love 's service , but to live to thee 

woe ! woe to me , on me return the smart 
 my burning tongue hath bred my mistress pain 
 for oft in pain , to pain my painful heart 
 with her due praise did of my state complain 
 i praised her eyes , whom never chance doth move 
 her breath , which makes a sour answer sweet 
 her milken breasts , the nurse of child like love 
 her legs , o legs ! her aye well stepping feet 
 pain heard her praise , and full of inward fire 
 ( first sealing up my heart as prey of his

 her face , this age 's praise , the thief doth kiss 
 o pain ! i now recant the praise i gave 
 and swear she is not worthy thee to have 

why are we by all creatures waited on 
 why do the prodigal elements supply 
 life and food to me , being more pure than i 
 simpler , and further from corruption 
 why brook'st thou , ignorant horse , subjection 
 why do you , bull and boar , so sillily 
 dissemble weakness , and by one man 's stroke die 
 whose whole kind you might swallow and feed upon 
 weaker i am , woe 's me ! and worse than you 
 you have not sinned , nor need be timorous 
 but wonder at a greater , for to us 
 created nature doth these things subdue 
 but their creator , whom sin nor nature tied 
 for us , his creatures and his foes , hath died

i pray to be the tool which to your hand 
 long use has shaped and moulded till it be 
 apt for your need , and , unconsideringly 
 you take it for its service . i demand 
 to be forgotten in the woven strand 
 which grows the multi coloured tapestry 
 of your bright life , and through its tissues lie 
 a hidden , strong , sustaining , grey toned band 
 i wish to dwell around your daylight dreams 
 the railing to the stairway of the clouds 
 to guard your steps securely up , where streams 
 a faery moonshine washing pale the crowds 
 of pointed stars . remember not whereby 
 you mount , protected , to the far flung sky 

hesper again his heavenly power display 'd 
 and shook the yielding canopy of shade 
 sudden the stars their trembling fires withdrew 
 returning splendors burst upon the view 
 floods of unfolding light the skies adorn 
 and more than midday glories grace the morn 
 so shone the earth , as if the sideral train 
 broad as full suns , had sail 'd the ethereal plain 
 when no distinguisht orb could strike the sight 
 but one clear blaze of all surrounding light 
 o'erflow ' d the vault of heaven . for now in view 
 remoter climes and future ages drew 
 whose deeds of happier fame , in long array 
 call 'd into vision , fill the newborn day 

oft in the after days , when thou and i 
 have fallen from the scope of human view 
 when , both together , under the sweet sky 
 we sleep beneath the daisies and the dew 
 men will recall thy gracious presence bland 
 conning the pictured sweetness of thy face 
 will pore o'er paintings by thy plastic hand 
 and vaunt thy skill and tell thy deeds of grace 
 oh , may they then , who crown thee with true bays 
 saying , “ what love unto her son she bore 
 make this addition to thy perfect praise 
 “ nor ever yet was mother worshipped more 
 so shall i live with thee , and thy dear fame 
 shall link my love unto thine honored name 

you ask me for a sonnet . ah , my dear 
 can clocks tick back to yesterday at noon 
 can cracked and fallen leaves recall last june 
 and leap up on the boughs , now stiff and sere 
 for your sake , i would go and seek the year 
 faded beyond the purple ranks of dune 
 blown sands of drifted hours , which the moon 
 streaks with a ghostly finger , and her sneer 
 pulls at my lengthening shadow . yes , ‘ tis that 
 my shadow stretches forward , and the ground 
 is dark in front because the light 's behind 
 it is grotesque , with such a funny hat 
 in watching it and walking i have found 
 more than enough to occupy my mind 

in florence once there dwelled a gentle youth 
 who loved a certain beauteous belle with truth 
 o'er all his actions she had full controul 
 to please he would have sold his very soul 
 if she amusements wished , he 'd lavish gold 
 convinced in love or war you should be bold 
 the cash ne'er spare :— invincible its pow'rs 
 o'erturning walls or doors where'er it show'rs 
 the precious ore can every thing o'ercome 
 ‘ twill silence barking curs : make servants dumb 
 and these can render eloquent at will 
 excel e'en tully in persuasive skill 
 in short he 'd leave no quarter unsubdued 
 unless therein the fair he could include 

the peopled fold thy kindly care have found 
 the horned bull , tremendous , spurns the ground 
 the lordly lion has enough and more 
 the forest trembles at his very roar 
 thou giv'st the ass his hide , the snail his shell 
 the puny wasp , victorious , guards his cell 
 thy minions , kings defend , controul devour 
 in all th ’ omnipotence of rule and power 
 foxes and statesmen subtle wiles ensure 
 the cit and polecat stink , and are secure 
 toads with their poison , doctors with their drug 
 the priest and hedgehog , in their robes , are snug 
 e'en silly women have defensive arts 
 their eyes , their tongues — and nameless other parts 

sweet sovereign , since so many minds remain 
 obedient subjects at thy beauty 's call 
 so many hearts bound in thy hairs as thrall 
 so many eyes die with one look 's disdain 
 go , seek the honour that doth thee pertain 
 that the fifth monarchy may thee befall 
 thou hast such means to conquer men withal 
 as all the world must yield or else be slain 
 to fight , thou need'st no weapons but thine eyes 
 thine hair hath gold enough to pay thy men 
 and for their food thy beauty will suffice 
 for men and armour , lady , care have none 
 for one will sooner yield unto thee then 
 when he shall meet thee naked all alone 

then spake king arthur to sir bedivere 
 “ far other is this battle in the west 
 whereto we move , than when we strove in youth 
 and brake the petty kings , and fought with rome 
 or thrust the heathen from the roman wall 
 and shook him thro ’ the north . ill doom is mine 
 to war against my people and my knights 
 the king who fights his people fights himself 
 and they my knights , who loved me once , the stroke 
 that strikes them dead is as my death to me 
 yet let us hence , and find or feel a way 
 thro ’ this blind haze , which ever since i saw 
 one lying in the dust at almesbury 
 hath folded in the passes of the world 

grant , fairest kind , a kiss unto thy friend 
 a blush replied , and yet a kiss i had 
 it is not heaven that can such nectar send 
 whereat my senses all amazed were glad 
 this done , she fled as one that was affrayed 
 and i desired to kiss by kissing more 
 my love she frowned , and i my kissing stayed 
 yet wished to kiss her as i did before 
 then as the vine the propping elm doth clasp 
 loath to depart till both together die 
 so fold me , sweet , until my latest gasp 
 that in thy arms to death i kissed may lie 
 thus whilst i live for kisses i must call 
 still kiss me , sweet , or kiss me not at all 

cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep 
 a maid of dian 's this advantage found 
 and his love kindling fire did quickly steep 
 in a cold valley fountain of that ground 
 which borrowed from this holy fire of love 
 a dateless lively heat still to endure 
 and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove 
 against strange maladies a sovereign cure 
 but at my mistress ’ eye love 's brand new fired 
 the boy for trial needs would touch my breast 
 i sick withal the help of bath desired 
 and thither hied a sad distempered guest 
 but found no cure , the bath for my help lies 
 where cupid got new fire ; my mistress ’ eyes 

o never say that i was false of heart 
 though absence seemed my flame to qualify 
 as easy might i from my self depart 
 as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie 
 that is my home of love , if i have ranged 
 like him that travels i return again 
 just to the time , not with the time exchanged 
 so that my self bring water for my stain 
 never believe though in my nature reigned 
 all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood 
 that it could so preposterously be stained 
 to leave for nothing all thy sum of good 
 for nothing this wide universe i call 
 save thou my rose , in it thou art my all 

were this to happen now , scamander 's stream 
 would not so easily preserve esteem 
 but crimes like these ( whoever was abused 
 in former days , were easily excused 
 with time our maxims change , and what was then 
 though wrong at present , may prevail agen 
 scamander 's spouse some raillery received 
 but in the end she fully was relieved 
 a lover e'en superior thought her charms 
 ( his taste was such ) and took her to his arms 
 the gods can nothing spoil ! but should they cause 
 a belle to lose a portion of applause 
 a handsome fortune give , and you 'll behold 
 that ev'ry thing can be repaired by gold 

upon a rock i sat — a mountain side 
 far , far forsaken of the old sea 's lip 
 a rock where ancient waters ’ rise and dip 
 recoil and plunge , eddy , and oscillant tide 
 had worn and worn , while races lived and died 
 involved channels . where the sea weed 's drip 
 followed the ebb , now crumbling lichens sip 
 sparse dews of heaven that down with sunset slide 
 i sat long gazing southward . a dry flow 
 of withering wind sucked up my drooping strength 
 itself weak from the desert 's burning length 
 behind me piled , away and up did go 
 great sweeps of savage mountains — up , away 
 where snow gleams ever , panthers roam , they say 

it hath been heretofore my chance to see 
 horsemen with martial order shifting camp 
 to onset sallying , or in muster rang 'd 
 or in retreat sometimes outstretch 'd for flight 
 light armed squadrons and fleet foragers 
 scouring thy plains , arezzo ! have i seen 
 and clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts 
 now with the sound of trumpets , now of bells 
 tabors , or signals made from castled heights 
 and with inventions multiform , our own 
 or introduc 'd from foreign land ; but ne'er 
 to such a strange recorder i beheld 
 in evolution moving , horse nor foot 
 nor ship , that tack 'd by sign from land or star 

were't aught to me i bore the canopy 
 with my extern the outward honouring 
 or laid great bases for eternity 
 which proves more short than waste or ruining 
 have i not seen dwellers on form and favour 
 lose all , and more by paying too much rent 
 for compound sweet ; forgoing simple savour 
 pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent 
 no , let me be obsequious in thy heart 
 and take thou my oblation , poor but free 
 which is not mixed with seconds , knows no art 
 but mutual render , only me for thee 
 hence , thou suborned informer , a true soul 
 when most impeached , stands least in thy control 

here morning in the ploughman 's songs is met 
 ere yet one footstep shows in all the sky 
 and twilight in the east , a doubt as yet 
 shows not her sleeve of grey to know her bye 
 woke early , i arose and thought that first 
 in winter time of all the world was i 
 the old owls might have hallooed if they durst 
 but joy just then was up and whistled bye 
 a merry tune which i had known full long 
 but could not to my memory wake it back 
 until the ploughman changed it to the song 
 o happiness , how simple is thy track 
 — tinged like the willow shoots , the east 's young brow 
 glows red and finds thee singing at the plough 

ah whither , poor forsaken , wilt thou go 
 to go from sorrow and thine own distress 
 when every place presents like face of woe 
 and no remove can make thy sorrows less 
 yet go , forsaken ! leave these woods , these plains 
 leave her and all , and all for her that leaves 
 thee and thy love forlorn , and both disdains 
 and of both wrongful deems and ill conceives 
 seek out some place , and see if any place 
 can give the least release unto thy grief 
 convey thee from the thought of thy disgrace 
 steal from thyself and be thy cares ’ own thief 
 but yet what comforts shall i hereby gain 
 bearing the wound , i needs must feel the pain 

shame is a shadow cast by sin : yet shame 
 itself may be a glory and a grace 
 refashioning the sin disfashioned face 
 a nobler bruit than hollow sounded fame 
 a new lit lustre on a tarnished name 
 one virtue pent within an evil place 
 strength for the fight , and swiftness for the race 
 a stinging salve , a life requickening flame 
 a salve so searching we may scarcely live 
 a flame so fierce it seems that we must die 
 an actual cautery thrust into the heart 
 nevertheless , men die not of such smart 
 and shame gives back what nothing else can give 
 man to himself ,— then sets him up on high 

yet all its varied charms , forever free 
 from task and tribute , labor yields to thee 
 no more , when april sheds her fitful rain 
 the sower 's hand shall cast its flying grain 
 no more , when autumn strews the flaming leaves 
 the reaper 's band shall gird its yellow sheaves 
 for thee alike the circling seasons flow 
 till the first blossoms heave the latest snow 
 in the stiff clod below the whirling drifts 
 in the loose soil the springing herbage lifts 
 in the hot dust beneath the parching weeds 
 life 's withering flower shall drop its shrivelled seeds 
 its germ entranced in thy unbreathing sleep 
 till what thou sowest mightier angels reap 

“ ho ! the warrior that scorneth the foe and fire 
 hey ó ka will crown with his heart 's desire 
 he snatched from the embers a red hot brand 
 and held it aloft in his naked hand 
 he stood like a statue in bronze or stone 
 not a muscle moved , and the braves looked on 
 he turned to the chieftain ,— “ i scorn the fire 
 ten feathers i wear of the great wanmde é; 
 then grant me , wak â wa , my heart 's desire 
 let the sunlight shine in my lonely tee 
 i laugh at red death and i laugh at red fire 
 brave red cloud is only afraid of fear 
 but wiw â st è is fair to his heart and dear 
 then grant him , wak â wa , his heart 's desire 

my love , i have no fear that thou shouldst die 
 albeit i ask no fairer life than this 
 whose numbering clock is still thy gentle kiss 
 while time and peace with hands enlock è d fly 
 yet care i not where in eternity 
 we live and love , well knowing that there is 
 no backward step for those who feel the bliss 
 of faith as their most lofty yearnings high 
 love hath so purified my being 's core 
 meseems i scarcely should be startled even 
 to find , some morn , that thou hadst gone before 
 since , with thy love , this knowledge too was given 
 which each calm day doth strengthen more and more 
 that they who love are but one step from heaven 

o me ! what eyes hath love put in my head 
 which have no correspondence with true sight 
 or if they have , where is my judgment fled 
 that censures falsely what they see aright 
 if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote 
 what means the world to say it is not so 
 if it be not , then love doth well denote 
 love 's eye is not so true as all men 's : no 
 how can it ? o how can love 's eye be true 
 that is so vexed with watching and with tears 
 no marvel then though i mistake my view 
 the sun it self sees not , till heaven clears 
 o cunning love , with tears thou keep'st me blind 
 lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find 

a carver , having loved too long in vain 
 hewed out the portraiture of venus ’ son 
 in marble rock , upon the which did rain 
 small drizzling drops , that from a fount did run 
 imagining the drops would either wear 
 his fury out , or quench his living flame 
 but when he saw it bootless did appear 
 he swore the water did augment the same 
 so i , that seek in verse to carve thee out 
 hoping thy beauty will my flame allay 
 viewing my verse and poems all throughout 
 find my will rather to my love obey 
 that with the carver i my work do blame 
 finding it still th ’ augmenter of my flame 

there is a booming in the forest boughs 
 tremendous feet seem trampling through the trees 
 the storm is at his wildman revelries 
 and earth and heaven echo his carouse 
 night reels with tumult ; and , from out her house 
 of cloud , the moon looks ,— like a face one sees 
 in nightmare ,— hurrying , with pale eyes that freeze 
 stooping above with white , malignant brows 
 the isolated oak upon the hill 
 that seemed , at sunset , in terrific lands 
 a titan head black in a sea of blood 
 now seems a monster harp , whose wild strings thrill 
 to the vast fingering of innumerable hands 
 spirits of tempest and of solitude 

down the strait vistas where a city street 
 fades in pale dust and vaporous distances 
 stained with far fumes the light grows less and less 
 and the sky reddens round the day 's retreat 
 now out of orient chambers , cool and sweet 
 like nature 's pure lustration , dusk comes down 
 now the lamps brighten and the quickening town 
 rings with the trample of returning feet 
 and pleasure , risen from her own warm mould 
 sunk all the drowsy and unloved daylight 
 in layers of odorous softness , paphian girls 
 cover with gauze , with satin , and with pearls 
 crown , and about her spangly vestments fold 
 the ermine of the empire of the night 

“ twas thou , bold hector ! whose resistless hand 
 first seized a ship on that contested strand 
 the same which dead protesilaus bore 
 the first that touch ’ d the unhappy trojan shore 
 for this in arms the warring nations stood 
 and bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood 
 no room to poise the lance or bend the bow 
 but hand to hand , and man to man , they grow 
 wounded , they wound ; and seek each other ’ s hearts 
 with falchions , axes , swords , and shorten ’ d darts 
 the falchions ring , shields rattle , axes sound 
 swords flash in air , or glitter on the ground 
 with streaming blood the slippery shores are dyed 
 and slaughter ’ d heroes swell the dreadful tide 

unrighteous lord of love , what law is this 
 that me thou makest thus tormented be 
 the whiles she lordeth in licentious blisse 
 of her freewill , scorning both thee and me 
 see ! how the tyrannesse doth ioy to see 
 the hugh mass á cres which her eyes do make 
 and humbled harts brings captive unto thee 
 that thou of them mayst mightie vengeance take 
 but her proud hart doe thou a little shake 
 and that high look , with which she doth comptroll 
 all this worlds pride , bow to a baser make 
 and al her faults in thy black booke enroll 
 that i may laugh at her in equall sort 
 as she doth laugh at me , and makes my pain her sport 

i must not grieve my love , whose eyes would read 
 lines of delight , whereon her youth might smile 
 flowers have a time before they come to seed 
 and she is young , and now must sport the while 
 ah sport , sweet maid , in season of these years 
 and learn to gather flowers before they wither 
 and where the sweetest blossoms first appears 
 let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither 
 lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air 
 and calm the tempest which my sighs do raise 
 pity and smiles do best become the fair 
 pity and smiles shall yield thee lasting praise 
 make me to say , when all my griefs are gone 
 happy the heart that sighed for such a one 

perhaps some village poet waited there 
 who day and night toiled hard in metres rare 
 to sing the deeds and virtues of his prince 
 and trace them on the leaves of that lone palm 
 which stood close by his humble cottage home 
 perhaps with faces that bespoke deep grief 
 a troop of farmers there had come to tell 
 to their sport loving prince the havoc wrought 
 upon their toiling cattle by wild beasts 
 that nightly from their hill abodes came down 
 to feast on them . and in that motley crowd 
 were servants of the state and many more 
 who long had waited merely for a glimpse 
 of their just ruler d é sing holding court 

the ladies named were wives of our gallants 
 so fond of contraband , and smuggled grants 
 who , vexed to be confined , still praised the dame 
 for skewing such address to ‘ scape from blame 
 she soon returned , and with her brought the fair 
 who , gaily singing , entered free from care 
 the painter them received with bow and kiss 
 to praise their beauty he was not remiss 
 their dress was charming ; all he much admired 
 their presence frolick , fun , and jest inspired 
 which no way pleased the husbands in the cage 
 who saw the freaks with marks of bursting rage 
 the door half open gave a view complete 
 how freely he their wives was led to treat 

full many a glorious morning have i seen 
 flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye 
 kissing with golden face the meadows green 
 gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy 
 anon permit the basest clouds to ride 
 with ugly rack on his celestial face 
 and from the forlorn world his visage hide 
 stealing unseen to west with this disgrace 
 even so my sun one early morn did shine 
 with all triumphant splendour on my brow 
 but out , alack ! he was but one hour mine 
 the region cloud hath mask 'd him from me now 
 yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth 
 suns of the world may stain when heaven 's sun staineth 

shall i then silent be , or shall i speake 
 and if i speake , her wrath renew i shall 
 and if i silent be , my hart will breake 
 or choked be with overflowing gall 
 what tyranny is this , both my hart to thrall 
 and eke my toung with proud restraint to tie 
 that neither i may speake nor thinke at all 
 but like a stupid stock in silence die 
 yet i my hart with silence secretly 
 will teach to speak and my just cause to plead 
 and eke mine eies , with meek humility 
 love learned letters to her eyes to read 
 which her deep wit , that true harts thought can spel 
 wil soon conceive , and learne to construe well 

last , and not least of all these comforts is 
 the man that 's wedded unto some disease 
 a peevish , crazy , and a sickly wife 
 the burthen and the nusance of his life 
 her bed , the meer resemblance of a tomb 
 and an apothecarys shop her room 
 coughing and spitting all the night she lies 
 a very antidote to marriage joys 
 yet the poor man must bear with all these ills 
 besides the excessive charge of physick bills 
 a nurse , fine cordials , and a hundred things 
 until his substance she to little brings 
 till may be she at length resigns to death 
 the only comfort he cou 'd hope on earth 

when your perfections to my thoughts appear 
 they say among themselves , “ o happy we 
 whichever shall so rare an object see 
 but happy heart , if thoughts less happy were 
 for their delights have cost my heart full dear 
 in whom of love a thousand causes be 
 and each cause breeds a thousand loves in me 
 and each love more than thousand hearts can bear 
 how can my heart so many loves then hold 
 which yet by heaps increase from day to day 
 but like a ship that 's o'ercharged with gold 
 must either sink or hurl the gold away 
 but hurl not love ; thou canst not , feeble heart 
 in thine own blood , thou therefore drown è d art 

when beauty to the world vouchsafes this bliss 
 to show the one whose other there is not

 roof 'd with translucent shell the turrets blaze

“ but if you suffer from a chill attack 
 or other chance should lay you on your back 
 you then have one who 'll sit by your bed side 
 will see the needful remedies applied 
 and call in a physician , to restore 
 your health , and give you to your friends once more 
 nor wife nor son desires your welfare : all 
 detest you , neighbours , gossips , great and small 
 what marvel if , when wealth 's your one concern 
 none offers you the love you never earn 
 nay , would you win the kinsmen nature sends 
 made ready to your hand , and keep them friends 
 ‘ twere but lost labour , as if one should train 
 a donkey for the course by bit and rein 

then we asked was there anything 
 up attic that we 'd ever want again 
 the attic was less to us than the cellar 
 if the bones liked the attic , let them like it 
 let them stay in the attic . when they sometimes 
 come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed 
 behind the door and headboard of the bed 
 brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers 
 with sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter 
 that 's what i sit up in the dark to say 
 to no one any more since toffile died 
 let them stay in the attic since they went there 
 i promised toffile to be cruel to them 
 for helping them be cruel once to him 

thus is his cheek the map of days outworn 
 when beauty lived and died as flowers do now 
 before these bastard signs of fair were born 
 or durst inhabit on a living brow 
 before the golden tresses of the dead 
 the right of sepulchres , were shorn away 
 to live a second life on second head 
 ere beauty 's dead fleece made another gay 
 in him those holy antique hours are seen 
 without all ornament , it self and true 
 making no summer of another 's green 
 robbing no old to dress his beauty new 
 and him as for a map doth nature store 
 to show false art what beauty was of yore 

this is my play 's last scene ; here heavens appoint 
 my pilgrimage 's last mile ; and my race 
 idly yet quickly run , hath this last pace 
 my span 's last inch , my minute 's latest point 
 and gluttonous death will instantly unjoint 
 my body and soul , and i shall sleep a space 
 but my ever waking part shall see that face 
 whose fear already shakes my every joint 
 then as my soul to heaven , her first seat , takes flight 
 and earth born body in the earth shall dwell 
 so fall my sins , that all may have their right 
 to where they 're bred , and would press me to hell 
 impute me righteous ; thus purged of evil 
 for thus i leave the world , the flesh , the devil 

nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance 
 to watch the gate was warlike nisus ’ chance 
 his father hyrtacus of noble blood 
 his mother was a huntress of the wood 
 and sent him to the wars . well could he bear 
 his lance in fight , and dart the flying spear 
 but better skill 'd unerring shafts to send 
 beside him stood euryalus , his friend 
 euryalus , than whom the trojan host 
 no fairer face , or sweeter air , could boast  
 scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun 
 one was their care , and their delight was one 
 one common hazard in the war they shar 'd 
 and now were both by choice upon the guard 

while loftier souls command , nay , make their fate 
 thy fate made thee and forced thee to be great 
 yet fortune , who so oft , so blindly sheds 
 her brightest halo round the weakest heads 
 found thee undazzled , tranquil as before 
 proud to be useful , scorning to be more 
 less moved by glory 's than by duty 's claim 
 renown the meed , but self applause the aim 
 all that thou wert reflects less fame on thee 
 far less , than all thou didst forbear to be 
 nor yet the patriot of one land alone 
 for , thine 's a name all nations claim their own 
 and every shore , where breathed the good and brave 
 echoed the plaudits thy own country gave 

who will believe my verse in time to come 
 if it were filled with your most high deserts 
 though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb 
 which hides your life , and shows not half your parts 
 if i could write the beauty of your eyes 
 and in fresh numbers number all your graces 
 the age to come would say this poet lies 
 such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces 
 so should my papers ( yellowed with their age 
 be scorned , like old men of less truth than tongue 
 and your true rights be termed a poet 's rage 
 and stretched metre of an antique song 
 but were some child of yours alive that time 
 you should live twice in it , and in my rhyme 

pity refusing my poor love to feed 
 a beggar starved for want of help he lies 
 and at your mouth , the door of beauty , cries 
 that thence some alms of sweet grants might proceed 
 but as he waiteth for some alm è s deed 
 a cherry tree before the door he spies 
 “ o dear , ” quoth he , “ two cherries may suffice 
 two only may save life in this my need 
 but beggars , can they nought but cherries eat 
 pardon my love , he is a goddess ’ son 
 and never feedeth but on dainty meat 
 else need he not to pine , as he hath done 
 for only the sweet fruit of this sweet tree 
 can give food to my love and life to me 

eyes calm beside thee ( lady , could'st thou know 
 may turn away thick with fast gathering tears 
 i glance not where all gaze : thrilling and low 
 their passionate praises reach thee — my cheek wears 
 alone no wonder when thou passest by 
 thy tremulous lids bent and suffused reply 
 to the irrepressible homage which doth glow 
 on every lip but mine : if in thine ears 
 their accents linger — and thou dost recall 
 me as i stood , still , guarded , very pale 
 beside each votarist whose lighted brow 
 wore worship like an aureole , “ o'er them all 
 my beauty , ” thou wilt murmur , “ did prevail 
 save that one only : ” — lady , could'st thou know 

now roll like winged storms the solid lines 
 the clarion thunders and the battle joins 
 thick flames in vollied flashes load the air 
 and echoing mountains give the noise of war 
 sulphureous clouds rise reddening round the height 
 and veil the skies , and wrap the sounding fight 
 soon from the skirts of smoke , where thousands toil 
 ranks roll away and into light recoil 
 starke pours upon them in a storm of lead 
 his hosted swains bestrew the field with dead 
 pierce with strong bayonets the german reins 
 whelm two battalions in their captive chains

 and breyman next his gushing lifeblood yield

 who envied comrades sleeping in the grave 
 shall i exult o'er inoffensive dust 
 of valiant men whose swords have turned to rust 
 shall i , like menelaus by the coast 
 o'er dead ajaces make unmanly boast 
 shall i , in chains of an ignoble verse 
 degrade dead hectors , and their pangs rehearse 
 nay ! such is not the mood this people feels 
 their chariots drag no foemen by the heels 
 let ajax slumber by the sounding sea 
 from the fell passion of his madness free 
 let hector 's ashes unmolested sleep 
 but not to day shall any priam weep 

in the greek land of old there was a king 
 happy in battle , rich in everything 
 most rich in this , that he a daughter had 
 whose beauty made the longing city glad 
 she was so fair , that strangers from the sea 
 just landed , in the temples thought that she 
 was venus visible to mortal eyes 
 new come from cyprus for a world 's surprise 
 she was so beautiful that had she stood 
 on windy ida by the oaken wood 
 and bared her limbs to that bold shepherd 's gaze 
 troy might have stood till now with happy days 
 and those three fairest , all have left the land 
 and left her with the apple in her hand 

the spring returns ! what matters then that war 
 on the horizon like a beacon burns 
 that death ascends , man 's most desired star 
 that darkness is his hope ? the spring returns 
 triumphant through the wider arched cope 
 she comes , she comes , unto her tyranny 
 and at her coronation are set ope 
 the prisons of the mind , and man is free 
 the beggar garbed or over bent with snows 
 each mortal , long defeated , disallowed 
 feeling her touch , grows stronger limbed , and knows 
 the purple on his shoulders and is proud 
 the spring returns ! o madness beyond sense 
 breed in our bones thine own omnipotence 

it is not to be thought of that the flood 
 of british freedom , which to the open sea 
 of the world 's praise from dark antiquity 
 hath flowed , “ with pomp of waters , unwithstood 
 road by which all might come and go that would 
 and bear out freights of worth to foreign lands 
 that this most famous stream in bogs and sands 
 should perish ; and to evil and to good 
 be lost for ever . in our halls is hung 
 armoury of the invincible knights of old 
 we must be free or die , who speak the tongue 
 that shakespeare spake ; the faith and morals hold 
 which milton held . in every thing we are sprung 
 of earth 's first blood , have titles manifold 

life ever seems as from its present site 
 it aimed to lure us . mountains of the past 
 it melts , with all their crags and caverns vast 
 into a purple cloud ! across the night 
 which hides what is to be , it shoots a light 
 all rosy with the yet unrisen dawn 
 not the near daisies , but yon distant height 
 attracts us , lying on this emerald lawn 
 and always , be the landscape what it may 
 blue , misty hill or sweep of glimmering plain

 the fine , faint limit of the bounding day

from mohawk 's mouth , far westing with the sun

 and towns and empires rise along their side

 like coruscations from the boreal morn

 ten thousand watery glades ; that , round him curl 'd

now is the blackest hour of the long night 
 the soul of midnight . now , the pallid stars 
 shine in the highest silver and the wind 
 that creepeth chill across the sleeping world 
 holdeth no hint of morning . i look out 
 into the glory of the night with tired 
 wide , sleepless eyes and think of you . there is 
 the hush of some great spirit o'er the earth 
 here , in the silence earth and sky are met 
 and merged into infinity . oh , god 
 of all , thou who beholdest destiny 
 as simple , thou who understandest life 
 from birth to re birth , who knows all our souls 
 grant her thy perfect benediction , rest 

from fairest creatures we desire increase 
 that thereby beauty 's rose might never die 
 but as the riper should by time decease 
 his tender heir might bear his memory 
 but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes 
 feed'st thy light 's flame with self substantial fuel 
 making a famine where abundance lies 
 thy self thy foe , to thy sweet self too cruel 
 thou that art now the world 's fresh ornament 
 and only herald to the gaudy spring 
 within thine own bud buriest thy content 
 and tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding 
 pity the world , or else this glutton be 
 to eat the world 's due , by the grave and thee

 nor e'er was to the bowers of bliss conveyed

 ‘ friend , did ye mark that fountain yesterday 
 made to run wine ?— but this had run itself 
 all out like a long life to a sour end 
 and them that round it sat with golden cups 
 to hand the wine to whosoever came 
 the twelve small damosels white as innocence 
 in honour of poor innocence the babe 
 who left the gems which innocence the queen 
 lent to the king , and innocence the king 
 gave for a prize — and one of those white slips 
 handed her cup and piped , the pretty one

 the porpoise 's slow wheel to break the sheen 
 of satin water indolently green 
 when for'ard the crew , caps tilted over eyes

 the sleepy summer days ; the summer nights

 the motionless nights , the vaulted nights of june

mysterious night ! spread wide thy silvery plume 
 soft as swan 's down , brood o'er the sapphirine 
 breadth of still shadowy waters dark as wine 
 smooth out the liquid heavens that stars illume 
 come with fresh airs breathing the faint perfume 
 of deep walled gardens , groves of whispering pine

 her snowy browes lyke budded bellamoures 
 her lovely eyes lyke pincks but newly spred 
 her goodly bosome lyke a strawberry bed 
 her neck lyke to a bounch of cullambynes 
 her brest lyke lillyes , ere their leaves be shed 
 her nipples lyke young blossomd jessemynes

lo , the poor indian ! whose untutored mind 
 sees god in clouds , or hears him in the wind 
 his soul , proud science never taught to stray 
 far as the solar walk , or milky way

 behind the cloud topped hill , an humbler heaven 
 some safer world in depths of woods embraced 
 some happier island in the watery waste 
 where slaves once more their native land behold

and as the loving servant weeping stood 
 loath to awake her to her evil doom 
 she opened her large violet eyes , and gazed 
 upon the morning sunlight stealing in 
 the clear light trembling , growing on the wall 
 and as she looked , her eyes grew like the eyes 
 of blessed angels looking on their lord 
 and high toward heaven she lifted up her hands 
 then clasped them in content upon her breast 
 and cried out in a glad voice , “ oh , my heart

without delay they to the convent flew 
 but when the holy mansion came in view

 a citizen his barn for this arranged

 and the ancestral glories of the past 
 all fell together , crumbling in disgrace

 his daughters talking in the dead of night 
 in their own chamber , and without a light 
 listening , as he was wont , he overheard 
 and learned the dreadful secret , word by word

the city slept beneath the moonbeam 's glance 
 her white walls gleaming through the vines of france 
 and all was hushed , save where the footsteps fell 
 on some high tower , of midnight sentinel 
 but one still watched ; no self encircled woes 
 chased from his lids the angel of repose 
 he watched , he wept , for thoughts of bitter years 
 bowed his dark lashes , wet with burning tears 
 his country 's sufferings and her children 's shame 
 streamed o'er his memory like a forest 's flame 
 each treasured insult , each remembered wrong 
 rolled through his heart and kindled into song 
 his taper faded ; and the morning gales 
 swept through the world the war song of marseilles 

nay , lord , not thus ! white lilies in the spring 
 sad olive groves , or silver breasted dove

 ( the full heart beating ‘ gainst the elbow warm 
 we pass 'd to the great refreshment hall 
 where the heap 'd cheese cakes and the comfits small 
 lay , like a hive of sunbeams , to burn 
 around the margin of the negus urn 
 when my poor quivering hand you finger 'd twice 
 and , with inquiring accents , whisper 'd “ ice 
 water , or cream ? ” i could no more dissemble 
 but dropp 'd upon the couch all in a tremble 
 a swimming faintness misted o'er my brain 
 the corks seem 'd starting from the brisk champagne 
 the custards fell untouch 'd upon the floor 
 thine eyes met mine . that night we danced no more 

oft have we trod the vales of castaly 
 and heard sweet notes of sylvan music blown 
 from antique reeds to common folk unknown 
 and often launched our bark upon that sea 
 which the nine muses hold in empery 
 and ploughed free furrows through the wave and foam 
 nor spread reluctant sail for more safe home 
 till we had freighted well our argosy 
 of which despoiled treasures these remain 
 sordello 's passion , and the honeyed line 
 of young endymion , lordly tamburlaine 
 driving his pampered jades , and more than these 
 the seven fold vision of the florentine 
 and grave browed milton 's solemn harmonies 

old friend , farewell ! your kindly door again 
 i enter , but the master 's hand in mine 
 no more clasps welcome , and the temperate wine 
 that cheered our long nights , other lips must stain 
 all is unchanged , but i expect in vain 
 the face alert , the manners free and fine 
 the seventy years borne lightly as the pine 
 wears its first down of snow in green disdain 
 much did he , and much well ; yet most of all 
 i prized his skill in leisure and the ease 
 of a life flowing full without a plan 
 for most are idly busy ; him i call 
 thrice fortunate who knew himself to please 
 learned in those arts that make a gentleman 

afar in the desert i love to ride 
 with the silent bush boy alone by my side 
 o'er the brown karroo , where the bleating cry 
 of the springbok 's fawn sounds plaintively 
 and the timorous quagga 's shrill whistling neigh 
 is heard by the fountain at twilight gray 
 where the zebra wantonly tosses his mane 
 with wild hoof scouring the desolate plain 
 and the fleet footed ostrich over the waste 
 speeds like a horseman who travels in haste 
 hieing away to the home of her rest 
 where she and her mate have scooped their nest 
 far hid from the pitiless plunderer 's view 
 in the pathless depths of the parched karroo 

returning from its daily quest , my spirit 
 changed thoughts and vile in thee doth weep to find 
 it grieves me that thy mild and gentle mind 
 those ample virtues which it did inherit 
 has lost . once thou didst loathe the multitude 
 of blind and madding men — i then loved thee 
 i loved thy lofty songs and that sweet mood 
 when thou wert faithful to thyself and me 
 i dare not now through thy degraded state 
 own the delight thy strains inspire — in vain 
 i seek what once thou wert — we cannot meet 
 and we were wont . again and yet again 
 ponder my words : so the false spirit shall fly 
 and leave to thee thy true integrity 

a light wind , from the open casement , fanned 
 my brow and helen 's , as we , hand in hand 
 sat looking out upon the twilight scene 
 in dreamy silence . helen 's dark blue eyes 
 like two lost stars that wandered from the skies 
 some night adown the meteor 's shining track 
 and always had been grieving to go back 
 now gazed up , wistfully , at heaven 's dome 
 and seemed to recognise and long for home 
 her sweet voice broke the silence : “ wish , maurine 
 before you speak ! you know the moon is new 
 and anything you wish for will come true 
 before it wanes . i do believe the sign 
 now tell me your wish , and i 'll tell you mine 

oft and in vain my rebel thoughts have ventured 
 to stop the passage of my vanquished heart 
 and shut those ways my friendly foe first entered 
 hoping thereby to free my better part 
 and whilst i guard the windows of this fort 
 where my heart 's thief to vex me made her choice 
 and thither all my forces do transport 
 another passage opens at her voice 
 her voice betrays me to her hand and eye 
 my freedom 's tyrant , conquering all by art 
 but ah ! what glory can she get thereby 
 with three such powers to plague one silly heart 
 yet my soul 's sovereign , since i must resign 
 reign in my thoughts , my love and life are thine 

straight from the sun 's grave in the deep clear west 
 a sweet strong wind blows , glad of life : and i 
 under the soft keen stardawn whence the sky 
 takes life renewed , and all night 's godlike breast 
 palpitates , gradually revealed at rest 
 by growth and change of ardours felt on high 
 make onward , till the last flame fall and die 
 and all the world by night 's broad hand lie blest 
 haply , meseems , as from that edge of death 
 whereon the day lies dark , a brightening breath 
 blows more of benediction than the morn 
 so from the graves whereon grief gazing saith 
 that half our heart of life there lies forlorn 
 may light or breath at least of hope be born 

oh let us never leave that happy throng 
 from that low attitude of love not cease 
 in all the world there is no other peace 
 in all the world no other shield from wrong 
 but chiefly , saviour , for thy feet we long 
 for no vain quiet , for no pride 's increase 
 but that , being weak , and thou divinely strong 
 us from our hateful selves thou mayst release 
 we wander from thy fold 's free holy air 
 forget thy looks , and take our fill of sin 
 but if thou keep us evermore within 
 we never surely can forget thee there 
 breathing thy breath , thy white robe given to wear 
 and loving thee for all thou diedst to win 

why art thou silent ? is thy love a plant 
 of such weak fibre that the treacherous air 
 of absence withers what was once so fair 
 is there no debt to pay , no boon to grant 
 yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant 
 bound to thy service with unceasing care 
 the mind 's least generous wish a mendicant 
 for naught but what thy happiness could spare 
 speak !— though this soft warm heart , once free to hold 
 a thousand tender pleasures , thine and mine 
 be left more desolate , more dreary cold 
 than a forsaken bird'shyppphennest filled with snow 
 ‘ mid its own bush of leafless eglantine 
 speak , that my torturing doubts their end may know 

thou hast made me , and shall thy work decay 
 repair me now , for now mine end doth haste 
 i run to death , and death meets me as fast 
 and all my pleasures are like yesterday 
 i dare not move my dim eyes any way 
 despair behind , and death before , doth cast 
 such terror , and my feeble flesh doth waste 
 by sin in it , which it towards hell doth weigh 
 only thou art above , and when towards thee 
 by thy leave i can look , i rise again 
 but our old subtle foe so tempteth me 
 that not one hour myself i can sustain 
 thy grace may wing me to prevent his art 
 and thou , like adamant , draw mine iron heart 

vain transitory splendours could not all 
 reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall 
 obscure it sinks , nor shall it more impart 
 an hour 's importance to the poor man 's heart 
 thither no more the peasant shall repair 
 to sweet oblivion of his daily care 
 no more the farmer 's news , the barber 's tale 
 no more the woodman 's ballad shall prevail 
 no more the smith his dusky brow shall clear 
 relax his ponderous strength , and lean to hear 
 the host himself no longer shall be found 
 careful to see the mantling bliss go round 
 nor the coy maid , half willing to be pressed 
 shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest 

i see gray teachers ,— on their work intent 
 their lavished lives , in endless labor spent 
 had closed at last in age and penury wrecked 
 martyrs , not burned , but frozen in neglect 
 save for the generous hands that stretched in aid 
 of worn out servants left to die half paid 
 ah , many a year will pass , i thought , ere we 
 such kindly forethought shall rejoice to see 
 monarchs are mindful of the sacred debt 
 that cold republics hasten to forget 
 i see the priest ,— if such a name he bears 
 who without pride his sacred vestment wears 
 and while the symbols of his tribe i seek 
 thus my first impulse bids me think and speak 

“ once did she hold the gorgeous east in fee 
 and was the safeguard of the west : the worth 
 of venice did not fall below her birth 
 venice , the eldest child of liberty 
 she was a maiden city , bright and free 
 no guile seduced , no force could violate 
 and , when she took unto herself a mate 
 she must espouse the everlasting sea 
 and what if she had seen those glories fade 
 those titles vanish , and that strength decay 
 yet shall some tribute of regret be paid 
 when her long life hath reached its final day 
 men are we , and must grieve when even the shade 
 of that which once was great , is passed away 

a harry of hoofs in a village street 
 a shape in the moonlight , a bulk in the dark 
 and beneath from the pebbles , in passing , a spark 
 struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet 
 that was all ! and yet , through the gloom and the light 
 the fate of a nation was riding that night 
 and the spark struck out by that steed , in his flight 
 kindled the land into flame with its heat 
 he has left the village and mounted the steep 
 and beneath him , tranquil and broad and deep 
 is the mystic , meeting the ocean tides 
 and under the alders , that skirt its edge 
 now soft on the sand , now loud on the ledge 
 is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides 

you 're no adulterer :— nor a thief am i 
 when i see plate and wisely pass it by 
 but take away the danger , in a trice 
 nature unbridled plunges into vice 
 what ? you to be my master , who obey 
 more persons , nay , more things than words can say 
 whom not the praetor 's wand , though four times waved 
 could make less tyrant ridden , less enslaved 
 press home the matter further : how d'ye call 
 the thrall who 's servant to another thrall 
 an understrapper , say ; the name will do 
 or fellow servant : such am i to you 
 for you , whose work i do , do others ’ work 
 and move as dolls move when their wires we jerk 

what matters it to me , whose countenance 
 is like the laocoon 's , full of pain ; whose forehead 
 is a ploughed harvest field , where three score years 
 have sown in sorrow and have reaped in anguish 
 to me , the artisan , to whom all women 
 have been as if they were not , or at most 
 a sudden rush of pigeons in the air 
 a flutter of wings , a sound , and then a silence 
 i am too old for love ; i am too old 
 to flatter and delude myself with visions 
 of never ending friendship with fair women 
 imaginations , fantasies , illusions 
 in which the things that cannot be take shape 
 and seem to be , and for the moment are 

you say that love then led us — you and me 
 i say ‘ twas hate , that wore love 's wanting eyes 
 hate that i could not tear away the lies 
 that wrapped you with their silken sorcery 
 hate that for you i could not open skies 
 where beauty lives of her own loveliness 
 that god would give me no omnipotence 
 to purge and mould anew your soul 's numb sense 
 aye , hate that i could love you not tho love 
 pent in me ached with passion born distress 
 while thro unfathomable dark the prize 
 seemed sinking , as my soul , from heaven above 
 love , say you ? love ? and hate rent us apart 
 i tell you hate alone so tears the heart 

my love lay sleeping , where birds music made 
 shutting her eyes , disdainful of the light 
 the heat was great but greater was the shade 
 which her defended from his burning sight 
 this cupid saw , and came a kiss to take 
 sucking sweet nectar from her sugared breath 
 she felt the touch , and blushed , and did awake 
 seeing t'was love , which she did think was death 
 she cut his wings and caus è d him to stay 
 making a vow , he should not thence depart 
 unless to her the wanton boy could pay 
 the truest , kindest and most loving heart 
 his feathers still she us è d for a fan 
 till by exchange my heart his feathers won 

then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes 
 and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he 
 remembered in what a haughtier guise 
 he had flung an alms to leprosie 
 when he girt his young life up in gilded mail 
 and set forth in search of the holy grail 
 the heart within him was ashes and dust 
 he parted in twain his single crust 
 he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink 
 and gave the leper to eat and drink 
 ‘ t was a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread 
 ‘ t was water out of a wooden bowl 
 yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed 
 and ‘ t was red wine he drank with his thirsty soul 

man , that wast godlike being a child , and now 
 no less than kinglike , art no more in sooth 
 for all thy grace and lordliness of youth 
 the crown that bids men 's branded foreheads bow 
 much more has branded and bowed down thy brow 
 and gnawn upon it as with fire or tooth 
 of steel or snake so sorely , that the truth 
 seems here to bear false witness . is it thou 
 child ? and is all the summer of all thy spring 
 this ? are the smiles that drew men 's kisses down 
 all faded and transfigured to the frown 
 that grieves thy face ? art thou this weary thing 
 then is no slave 's load heavier than a crown 
 and such a thrall no bondman as a king 

with clytia he no longer was received 
 than while he was a man of wealth believed 
 balls , concerts , op'ras , tournaments , and plays 
 expensive dresses , all engaging ways 
 were used to captivate this lady fair 
 while scarcely one around but in despair 
 wife , widow , maid , his fond affection sought 
 to gain him , ev'ry wily art was brought 
 but all in vain :— by passion overpow'red 
 the belle , whose conduct others would have soured 
 to him appeared a goddess full of charms 
 superior e'en to helen , in his arms 
 from whence we may conclude , the beauteous dame 
 was always deaf to fred'rick ' s ardent flame 

trust not the treason of those smyling lookes 
 untill ye have their guylefull traynes well tryde

 unto her love , and tempte to theyr decay 
 whome , being caught , she kills with cruell pryde 
 and feeds at pleasure on the wretched pray 
 yet even whylst her bloody hands them slay 
 her eyes looke lovely , and upon them smyle 
 that they take pleasure in their cruell play 
 and , dying , doe themselves of payne beguyle

but him , thus voyaging the deeps below 
 from far , on solyme 's aerial brow 
 the king of ocean saw , and seeing burn 'd 
 ( from aethiopia 's happy climes return 'd 
 the raging monarch shook his azure head 
 and thus in secret to his soul he said 
 “ heavens ! how uncertain are the powers on high

 in one man 's favour ; while a distant guest

 behold how near phoenecia 's land he draws

some time ago from rome , in smart array 
 a younger brother homeward bent his way 
 not much improved , as frequently the case 
 with those who travel to that famous place 
 upon the road oft finding , where he stayed 
 delightful wines , and handsome belle or maid 
 with careless ease he loitered up and down 
 one day there passed him in a country town 
 attended by a page , a lady fair 
 whose charming form and all engaging air 
 at once his bosom fired with fond desire 
 and nearer still , her beauties to admire 
 he most gallantly saw her safely home 
 attentions charm the sex where'er we roam 

could i outwear my present state of woe 
 with one brief winter , and indue i ’ the spring 
 hues of fresh youth , and mightily outgrow 
 the wan dark coil of faded suffering 
 forth in the pride of beauty issuing 
 a sheeny snake , the light of vernal bowers 
 moving his crest to all sweet plots of flowers 
 and watered vallies where the young birds sing 
 could i thus hope my lost delights renewing 
 i straightly would commend the tears to creep 
 from my charged lids ; but inwardly i weep 
 some vital heat as yet my heart is wooing 
 this to itself hath drawn the frozen rain 
 from my cold eyes and melted it again 

long while i sought to what i might compare 
 those powrefull eies which lighten my dark spright 
 yet find i nought on earth , to which i dare 
 resemble th'ymage of their goodly light 
 not to the sun , for they doo shine by night 
 nor to the moone , for they are changed never 
 nor to the starres , for they have purer sight 
 nor to the fire , for they consume not ever 
 nor to the lightning , for they still persever 
 nor to the diamond , for they are more tender 
 nor unto cristall , for nought may them sever 
 nor unto glasse , such basenesse mought offend her 
 then to the maker selfe they likest be 
 whose light doth lighten all that here we see 

at last with ling'ring steps she takes her way 
 to where great massive rocks like near the bay 
 upon a rock which seems a resting place 
 just formed by nature for some tired queen 
 she half reclines , and upward lifts her face 
 to drink in all the glory of the scene 
 low on her cheeks the veiling lashes sweep 
 that hid the languid fire within her eyes 
 like shadows fall'n on flowers that softly sleep 
 beneath night 's falling dews and bending skies 
 her dark brown hair , with gleams of flitting gold 
 her queenly head encircles as a crown 
 a wealth of hair whose careless waves enfold 
 the quivering sunlight , and its rays chain down 

then let good nature every charm exert 
 and while it mends it , win th ’ unfolding heart 
 let moral mirth a face of triumph wear 
 yet smile unconscious of th ’ extorted tear 
 see with what grace instructive satire flows 
 politely keen , in olio 's numbered prose 
 that great example should our zeal excite 
 and censors learn from addison to write 
 so , in our age , too prone to sport with pain 
 might soft humanity resume her reign 
 pride without rancour feel th ’ objected fault 
 and folly blush , as willing to be taught 
 critics grow mild , life 's witty warfare cease 
 and true good nature breathe the balm of peace 

fayre ye be sure , but cruell and unkind 
 as is a tygre , that with greedinesse 
 hunts after bloud ; when he by chance doth find 
 a feeble beast , doth felly him oppresse 
 fayre be ye sure , but proud and pitilesse 
 as is a storme , that all things doth prostrate 
 finding a tree alone all comfortlesse 
 beats on it strongly , it to ruinate 
 fayre be ye sure , but hard and obstinate 
 as is a rocke amidst the raging floods 
 gaynst which a ship , of succour desolate 
 doth suffer wreck both of her selfe and goods 
 that ship , that tree , and that same beast , am i 
 whom ye doe wreck , doe ruine , and destroy 

still on this scene of grandeur , plenty , peace 
 and ever varying beauty , he would gaze 
 with sadness . he had heard these prophecies 
 and felt the unrest in that great world within 
 hid from our blinded eyes , yet ever near 
 the very soul and life of this dead world 
 which seers and prophets open eyed have seen 
 on which the dying often raptured gaze 
 and where they live when they are mourned as dead 
 this world was now astir , foretelling day 
 “ a king shall come , they say , to rule the world 
 if he will rule ; but whence this mighty king 
 my years decline apace , and yet no son 
 of mine to rule or light my funeral pile 

inland , within a hollow vale , i stood 
 and saw , while sea was calm and air was clear 
 the coast of france , the coast of france how near 
 drawn almost into frightful neighbourhood 
 i shrunk , for verily the barrier flood 
 was like a lake , or river bright and fair 
 a span of waters ; yet what power is there 
 what mightiness for evil and for good 
 even so doth god protect us if we be 
 virtuous and wise : winds blow , and waters roll 
 strength to the brave , and power , and deity 
 yet in themselves are nothing ! one decree 
 spake laws to them , and said that by the soul 
 only the nations shall be great and free 

it now remains for you to school your child 
 and ask why god 's anointed he reviled 
 a king and princess dead ! did shimei worse 
 the cursor 's punishment should fright the curse 
 your son was warn 'd , and wisely gave it o'er 
 but he who counsell 'd him has paid the score 
 the heavy malice could no higher tend 
 but woe to him on whom the weights descend 
 so to permitted ills the demon flies 
 his rage is aim 'd at him who rules the skies 
 constrain 'd to quit his cause , no succour found 
 the foe discharges every tire around 
 in clouds of smoke abandoning the fight 
 but his own thundering peals proclaim his flight 

and now it would content me to yield up 
 those lofty hopes awhile , for present gifts 
 of humbler industry . but , oh , dear friend 
 the poet , gentle creature as he is 
 hath , like the lover , his unruly times 
 his fits when he is neither sick nor well 
 though no distress be near him but his own 
 unmanageable thoughts : his mind , best pleased 
 while she as duteous as the mother dove 
 sits brooding , lives not always to that end 
 but like the innocent bird , hath goadings on 
 that drive her as in trouble through the groves ; [ l 
 with me is now such passion , to be blamed 
 no otherwise than as it lasts too long 

where slanting banks are always with the sun 
 the daisy is in blossom even now 
 and where warm patches by the hedges run 
 the cottager when coming home from plough 
 brings home a cowslip root in flower to set 
 thus ere the christmas goes the spring is met 
 setting up little tents about the fields 
 in sheltered spots .— primroses when they get 
 behind the wood 's old roots , where ivy shields 
 their crimpled , curdled leaves , will shine and hide 
 cart ruts and horses ’ footings scarcely yield 
 a slur for boys , just crizzled and that 's all 
 frost shoots his needles by the small dyke side 
 and snow in scarce a feather 's seen to fall 

see the sole bliss heaven could on all bestow 
 which who but feels can taste , but thinks can know 
 yet poor with fortune , and with learning blind 
 the bad must miss ; the good , untaught , will find 
 slave to no sect , who takes no private road 
 but looks through nature up to nature 's god 
 pursues that chain which links th ’ immense design 
 joins heaven and earth , and mortal and divine 
 sees , that no being any bliss can know 
 but touches some above , and some below 
 learns , from this union of the rising whole 
 the first , last purpose of the human soul 
 and knows where faith , law , morals , all began 
 all end , in love of god , and love of man 

“ ye sons of atreus , and ye chiefs of greece 
 from priam , and the gallant sons of troy 
 i come , to bear , if ye be pleas 'd to hear 
 the words of paris , cause of all this war 
 the goods which hither in his hollow ships 
 ( would he had perish 'd rather !) paris brought 
 he will restore , and others add beside 
 but further says , the virgin wedded wife 
 of menelaus , though the gen'ral voice 
 of troy should bid him . he will not restore 
 then bids me ask , if from the deadly strife 
 such truce ye will accord us as may serve 
 to burn the dead : hereafter we may fight 
 till heav'n decide , and one with vict'ry crown 

in time the strong and stately turrets fall 
 in time the rose and silver lilies die 
 in time the monarchs captive are and thrall 
 in time the sea and rivers are made dry 
 the hardest flint in time doth melt asunder 
 still living fame in time doth fade away 
 the mountains proud we see in time come under 
 and earth for age we see in time decay 
 the sun in time forgets for to retire 
 from out the east where he was wont to rise 
 the basest thoughts we see in time aspire 
 and greedy minds in time do wealth despise 
 thus all , sweet fair , in time must have an end 
 except thy beauty , virtues , and thy friend 

ah , was it yrma with those radiant eyes 
 that came to greet and lead him through the skies 
 ay ; all the world was one wide rose white flame 
 as down the path to meet him yrma came 
 and caught the child up in her arms and cried 
 this is my child that moved in etain 's side 
 thy child and etain 's : i the unknown ideal 
 and she the rich , the incarnate , breathing real 
 are one ; for me thou never canst attain 
 but by the love i yield thee for etain 
 even as through christ thy soul allays its dearth 
 love 's heaven is only compassed upon earth 
 and by that love , in thine own etain 's eyes 
 thou shalt find all god 's untranscended skies 

with careful step to keep his balance up 
 he reels on warily along the street 
 slabbering at mouth and with a staggering stoop 
 mutters an angry look at all he meets 
 bumptious and vain and proud he shoulders up 
 and would be something if he knew but how 
 to any man on earth he will not stoop 
 but cracks of work , of horses and of plough 
 proud of the foolish talk , the ale he quaffs 
 he never heeds the insult loud that laughs 
 with rosy maid he tries to joke and play 
 who shrugs and nettles deep his pomp and pride 
 and calls him “ drunken beast ” and runs away 
 king to himself and fool to all beside

 of favour , not of due , i favour crave

 nor when on me bestowed your favours are 
 less favour in your face you shall not have 
 if favour then a wounded soul may save 
 of murder 's guilt , dear lady , then beware

“ let her be free and natural as the flowers

clear as of old the great voice rings to day 
 while sherwood 's oak leaves twine with aldworth 's bay 
 the voice of him the master and the sire 
 of one whole age and legion of the lyre 
 who sang his morning song when coleridge still 
 uttered dark oracles from highgate hill 
 and with new launch è d argosies of rhyme 
 gilds and makes brave this sombreing tide of time 
 far be the hour when lesser brows shall wear 
 the laurel glorious from that wintry hair 
 when he , the sovereign of our lyric day 
 in charon 's shallop must be rowed away 
 and hear , scarce heeding , ‘ mid the plash of oar 
 the ave atque vale from the shore 

ay me ! ay me ! with what another heart 
 in days far off , and with what other eyes 
 i used to watch — if i be he that watch 'd 
 the lucid outline forming round thee ; saw 
 the dim curls kindle into sunny rings 
 changed with thy mystic change , and felt my blood 
 glow with the glow that slowly crimson 'd all 
 thy presence and thy portals , while i lay 
 mouth , forehead , eyelids , growing dewy warm 
 with kisses balmier than half opening buds 
 of april , and could hear the lips that kiss 'd 
 whispering i knew not what of wild and sweet 
 like that strange song i heard apollo sing 
 while ilion like a mist rose into towers 

innocent paper ! whom too cruell hand

 did sacrifize unto the greedy fyre 
 well worthy thou to have found better hyre

 yet heresy nor treason didst conspire 
 but plead thy maisters cause , unjustly payned 
 whom she , all carelesse of his grief , constrayned

 and would not heare , when he to her complayned 
 the piteous passion of his dying smart

 and speake her good , though she requite it ill 

then rode geraint into the castle court 
 his charger trampling many a prickly star 
 of sprouted thistle on the broken stones 
 he looked and saw that all was ruinous 
 here stood a shattered archway plumed with fern 
 and here had fallen a great part of a tower 
 whole , like a crag that tumbles from the cliff 
 and like a crag was gay with wilding flowers 
 and high above a piece of turret stair 
 worn by the feet that now were silent , wound 
 bare to the sun , and monstrous ivy stems 
 claspt the gray walls with hairy fibred arms 
 and sucked the joining of the stones , and looked 
 a knot , beneath , of snakes , aloft , a grove 

thus , thus , o soul ! in that more awful hour 
 when the last judgment 's darker shadows lower 
 and , swift and stern , god 's messengers go forth 
 to reap the harvest of this fated earth 
 if then , on thee is found no crimson stain 
 of god 's own lamb on bloody calvary slain 
 if thou art resting not beneath the blood 
 of that one sacrifice ordained of god 
 where wilt thou fly ?— where hide thyself away 
 from the dread reck'ning of the judgment day 
 if resting ‘ neath the blood for sinners spilt 
 look up !— the judge himself has borne thy guilt 
 justice and judgement claim thy life in vain 
 since christ , thy passover , himself is slain

 for fair isoud , and die inglorious 
 let launcelot in guenever 's embrace 
 forget the consecrated vows he swore 
 and bring dark desolation on the land 
 my knight must grow the greater through his love 
 the better for my favour , the more pure 
 more than all gifts , or wealth of royal dower 
 i want , i crave , i claim this boon of thee 

“ is this ( returns the prince ) for mirth a time 
 when lawless gluttons riot , mirth 's a crime 
 the luscious wines , dishonour 'd , lose their taste 
 the song is noise , and impious is the feast 
 suffice it to have spent with swift decay 
 the wealth of kings , and made my youth a prey 
 but now the wise instructions of the sage 
 and manly thoughts inspired by manly age 
 teach me to seek redress for all my woe 
 here , or in pyle — in pyle , or here , your foe 
 deny your vessels , ye deny in vain 
 a private voyager i pass the main 
 free breathe the winds , and free the billows flow 
 and where on earth i live , i live your foe 

where fortless falmouth , looking o'er her bay 
 in terror saw the approaching thunders play 
 the fire begins ; the shells o'er arching fly 
 and shoot a thousand rainbows thro the sky 
 on charlestown spires , on bedford roofs they light 
 groton and fairfield kindle from the flight 
 norwalk expands the blaze ; o'er reading hills 
 high flaming danbury the welkin fills 
 esopus burns , newyork 's delightful fanes 
 and sea nursed norfolk light the neighboring plains 
 from realm to realm the smoky volumes bend 
 reach round the bays and up the streams extend 
 deep o'er the concave heavy wreaths are roll 'd 
 and midland towns and distant groves infold 

if cross 'd with all mishaps be my poor life 
 if one short day i never spent in mirth 
 if my sp'rit with itself holds lasting strife 
 if sorrow 's death is but new sorrow 's birth 
 if this vain world be but a mournful stage 
 where slave born man plays to the scoffing stars 
 if youth be toss 'd with love , with weakness age 
 if knowledge serves to hold our thoughts in wars 
 if time can close the hundred mouths of fame 
 and make what 's long since past , like that 's to be 
 if virtue only be an idle name 
 if being born i was but born to die 
 why seek i to prolong these loathsome days 
 the fairest rose in shortest time decays 

milton ! i think thy spirit hath passed away 
 from these white cliffs and high embattled towers 
 this gorgeous fiery coloured world of ours 
 seems fallen into ashes dull and grey 
 and the age changed unto a mimic play 
 wherein we waste our else too crowded hours 
 for all our pomp and pageantry and powers 
 we are but fit to delve the common clay 
 seeing this little isle on which we stand 
 this england , this sea lion of the sea 
 by ignorant demagogues is held in fee 
 who love her not : dear god ! is this the land 
 which bare a triple empire in her hand 
 when cromwell spake the word democracy 

whenas i wish , fair licia , for a kiss 
 from those sweet lips where rose and lilies strive 
 straight do mine eyes repine at such a bliss 
 and seek my lips thereof for to deprive 
 whenas i seek to glut mine eyes by sight 
 my lips repine and call mine eyes away 
 thus both contend to have each other 's right 
 and both conspire to work my full decay 
 o force admired of beauty in her pride 
 in whose each part such strange effects there be 
 that all my forces in themselves divide 
 and make my senses plainly disagree 
 if all were mine , this envy would be gone 
 then grant me all , fair sweet , or grant me none 

thus live undying through the lapse of time 
 the solemn legends of the warrior 's clime 
 like egypt 's pyramid or paestum 's fane 
 they stand the heralds of the voiceless plain 
 yet not like them , for time , by slow degrees 
 saps the gray stone and wears the embroidered frieze 
 and isis sleeps beneath her subject nile 
 and crumbled neptune strews his dorian pile 
 but art 's fair fabric , strengthening as it rears 
 its laurelled columns through the mist of years 
 as the blue arches of the bending skies 
 still gird the torrent , following as it flies 
 spreads , with the surges bearing on mankind 
 its starred pavilion o'er the tides of mind 

it is not then enough that men who give 
 the best gifts given of man to man should feel 
 alive , a snake 's head ever at their heel 
 small hurt the worms may do them while they live 
 such hurt as scorn for scorn 's sake may forgive 
 but now , when death and fame have set one seal 
 on tombs whereat love , grief , and glory kneel 
 men sift all secrets , in their critic sieve 
 of graves wherein the dust of death might shrink 
 to know what tongues defile the dead man 's name 
 with loathsome love , and praise that stings like shame 
 rest once was theirs , who had crossed the mortal brink 
 no rest , no reverence now : dull fools undress 
 death 's holiest shrine , life 's veriest nakedness 

ay ! it was so ; and julio had fain 
 have been a warrior ; but his very brain 
 grew fever 'd at the sickly thought of death 
 and to be stricken with a want of breath 
 to be the food of worms — inanimate 
 and cold as winter ,— and as desolate 
 and then to waste away , and be no more 
 than the dark dust !— the thought was like a sore 
 that gather 'd in his heart ; and he would say 
 “ a curse be on their laurels ! ” and decay 
 came over them ; the deeds that they had done 
 had fallen with their fortunes ; and anon 
 was julio forgotten , and his line 
 no wonder for this frenzied tale of mine 

e'en i who speak , alas ! have troubles met 
 within my bosom oft i feel regret 
 three children ere my marriage i had got 
 have i your father told this secret blot 
 have we together been less happy found 
 the list'ner had no sooner heard the sound 
 but like a man distracted off he flew 
 the saddle 's girth , which hazard near him threw 
 he took and fastened tightly ‘ bout his waist 
 then bawled around and round with anxious haste 
 i 'm girth 'd ! d'ye see , completely taken in 
 the people stared , an ‘ gan to laugh and grin 
 though each was conscious , if the truth were known 
 the ridicule in turn might be his own 

yet , being so chill 'd , do we not chide the sun 
 and say he wilful hides his face away 
 say ‘ tis his will makes the world drear and dun 
 and takes the golden glory from the day 
 the envious rack we rather should reproach 
 that comes betwixt us in despite of him 
 rebellious powers , that on his reign encroach 
 and , black themselves , his brightness joy to dim 
 so when the troubling mischiefs of the time 
 or baser minds , bent upon marring thee 
 stole moments of thy favour , then my rhyme 
 slander 'd thy love and slurr 'd thy constancy 
 yet the sun 's self unstain 'd and bright remains 
 and my heart knew thy stains were not thy stains 

i have dreamed sweet dreams of a summer night 
 when the moon was walking in cloudless light 
 and my soul to the regions of fancy sprung 
 while the spirits of air their soft anthems sung 
 strains wafted down from those heavenly spheres 
 which may not be warbled in waking ears 
 more sweet than the voice of waters flowing 
 than the breeze over beds of violets blowing 
 when it stirs the pines , and sultry day 
 fans himself cool with their tremulous play 
 on the sleeper 's ear those rich notes stealing 
 speak of purer and holier feeling 
 than man in his pilgrimage here below 
 in the bondage of sin , can ever know 

the lady has agreed , you will remark 
 that in a room where ev'ry part is dark 
 ( perhaps to ‘ scape the keeper 's prying sight 
 or shame directs exclusion of the light 
 she will receive your gay inconstant spouse 
 now , take her place ; the case deceit allows 
 make jack your friend ; nor haggle at the price 
 a hundred ducats give , is my advice 
 he 'll place you in the room where darkness reigns 
 think not too fast , nor suffer heavy chains 
 do what you wish , and utter not a word 
 to speak , assuredly would be absurd 
 ‘ twould spoil the whole ; destroy the project quite 
 attend , and see if all things be not right 

from the beginning good and fair are one 
 but men the beauty from the truth will part 
 and , though the truth is ever beauty 's heart 
 after the beauty will , short breathed , run 
 and the indwelling truth deny and shun 
 therefore , in cottage , synagogue , and mart 
 thy thoughts came forth in common speech , not art 
 with voice and eye , in jewish babylon 
 thou taughtest — not with pen or carved stone 
 nor in thy hand the trembling wires didst take 
 thou of the truth not less than all wouldst make 
 for truth 's sake even her forms thou didst disown 
 ere , through the love of beauty , truth shall fail 
 the light behind shall burn the broidered veil 

king solomon , before his palace gate 
 at evening , on the pavement tessellate 
 was walking with a stranger from the east 
 arrayed in rich attire as for a feast 
 the mighty runjeet sing , a learned man 
 and rajah of the realms of hindostan 
 and as they walked the guest became aware 
 of a white figure in the twilight air 
 gazing intent , as one who with surprise 
 his form and features seemed to recognize 
 and in a whisper to the king he said 
 “ what is yon shape , that , pallid as the dead 
 is watching me , as if he sought to trace 
 in the dim light the features of my face 

that scarce a piece i publish in a year 
 idle perhaps to you i may appear 
 but rather , that i write at all , admire

 to those preferred my compliments must send 
 now at the witnessing a will make one 
 hurried from this to that , my morning 's gone 
 some office must attend ; or else some ball 
 or else my lawyer 's summons to the hall 
 now a rehearsal , now a concert hear 
 and now a latin play at westminster 
 home after ten return , quite tir 'd and dos 'd 
 when is the piece , you want , to be compos 'd 

on such an eve , his palest beam he cast 
 when — athens ! here thy wisest looked his last 
 how watched thy better sons his farewell ray 
 that closed their murdered sage 's 
 not yet — not yet — sol pauses on the hill 
 the precious hour of parting lingers still 
 but sad his light to agonising eyes 
 and dark the mountain 's once delightful dyes 
 gloom o'er the lovely land he seemed to pour 
 the land , where phoebus never frowned before 
 but ere he sunk below cith æ ron 's head 
 the cup of woe was quaffed — the spirit fled 
 the soul of him who scorned to fear or fly 
 who lived and died , as none can live or die 

x . cease then , nor order imperfection name 
 our proper bliss depends on what we blame 
 know thy own point : this kind , this due degree 
 of blindness , weakness , heaven bestows on thee 
 submit — in this , or any other sphere 
 secure to be as bless 'd as thou canst bear 
 safe in the hand of one disposing power 
 or in the natal , or the mortal hour 
 all nature is but art , unknown to thee 
 all chance , direction , which thou canst not see 
 all discord , harmony not understood 
 all partial evil , universal good 
 and , spite of pride , in erring reason 's spite 
 one truth is clear , whatever is , is right 

far from his brawny hand euryalus hurled 
 a massy stone , and shook the ranks of troy 
 as when in anger against long screaming cranes 
 a watcher of the field leaps from the ground 
 in swift hand whirling round his head the sling 
 and speeds the stone against them , scattering 
 before its hum their ranks far down the wind 
 outspread , and they in huddled panic dart 
 with wild cries this way and that , who theretofore 
 swept on in ordered lines ; so shrank the foe 
 to right and left from that dread bolt of doom 
 hurled of euryalus . not in vain it flew 
 fate winged ; it shattered meles ’ helm and head 
 down to the eyes : so met him ghastly death 

not in our dreams , not even in our dreams 
 may we return to that sweet land of youth 
 that home of hope , of innocence , and truth 
 which as we farther roam but fairer seems 
 in that dim shadowy world , where the soul strays 
 when she has laid her mortal charge to rest 
 we oft behold far future hours and days 
 but ne'er live o'er the past , the happiest 
 how oft will fancy 's wild imaginings 
 bear us in sleep to times and worlds unseen 
 but ah ! not e'en unfettered fancy 's wings 
 can lead us back to aught that we have been 
 or waft us to that smiling , sunny shore 
 which e'en in slumber we may tread no more

the breed 's described : now , satire , if you can 
 their temper show , for manners make the man 
 fierce as the briton , as the roman brave 
 and less inclined to conquer than to save 
 eager to fight , and lavish of their blood 
 and equally of fear and forecast void 
 the pict has made them sour , the dane morose 
 false from the scot , and from the norman worse 
 what honesty they have , the saxon gave them 
 and that , now they grow old , begins to leave them 
 the climate makes them terrible and bold

 or , if he did , ‘ twere but a cause for shame

 my fire and air , my spirit , ador è d thee 
 unmix 'd with gross compounding of my earth 
 and thou wert best of truth , the first in grace 
 of all rich gems in virtue 's carcanet 
 then should i not love thee and give thee place 
 above all love of sense on woman set 
 in love of beauty , whate'er shape ‘ tis in 
 there 's nought of truth , if it must think of sin 

what seekest thou , far in the unknown land 
 in hope i follow joy gone on before 
 in hope and fear persistent more and more 
 as the dry desert lengthens out its sand 
 whilst day and night i carry in my hand 
 the golden key to ope the golden door 
 of golden home ; yet mine eye weepeth sore 
 for long the journey is that makes no stand 
 and who is this that veiled doth walk with thee 
 lo , this is love that walketh at my right 
 one exile holds us both , and we are bound 
 to selfsame home joys in the land of light 
 weeping thou walkest with him ; weepeth he 
 some sobbing weep , some weep and make no sound 

like as the seeded field greene grasse first showes

what i have instanced only in the best 
 is , in proportion , true of all the rest 
 take pains the genuine meaning to explore 
 there sweat , there strain : tug the laborious oar 
 search every comment that your care can find 
 some here , some there , may hit the poet 's mind 
 yet be not blindly guided by the throng 
 the multitude is always in the wrong 
 when things appear unnatural or hard 
 consult your author , with himself compared 
 who knows what blessing phoebus may bestow 
 and future ages to your labour owe 
 such secrets are not easily found out 
 but , once discovered , leave no room for doubt 

‘ tis bed time ; say your hymn , and bid “ good night 
 “ god bless mamma , papa , and dear ones all 
 your half shut eyes beneath your eye lids fall 
 another minute you will shut them quite 
 yes , i will carry you , put out the light 
 and tuck you up , although you are so tall 
 what will you give me , sleepy one , and call 
 my wages , if i settle you all right 
 i laid her golden curls upon my arm 
 i drew her little feet within my hand 
 her rosy palms were joined in trustful bliss 
 her heart next mine , beat gently , soft and warm 
 she nestled to me , and , by love 's command 
 paid me my precious wages ,— baby 's kiss 

minds strong by fits , irregularly great 
 that flash and darken like revolving lights 
 catch more the vulgar eye unschooled to wait 
 on the long curve of patient days and nights 
 bounding a whole life to the circle fair 
 of orbed fulfilment ; and this balanced soul 
 so simple in its grandeur , coldly bare 
 of draperies theatric , standing there 
 in perfect symmetry of self control 
 seems not so great at first , but greater grows 
 still as we look , and by experience learn 
 how grand this quiet is , how nobly stern 
 the discipline that wrought through life long throes 
 that energetic passion of repose 

the other two , slight air , and purging fire 
 are both with thee , wherever i abide 
 the first my thought , the other my desire 
 these present absent with swift motion slide 
 for when these quicker elements are gone 
 in tender embassy of love to thee 
 my life being made of four , with two alone 
 sinks down to death , oppressed with melancholy 
 until life 's composition be recured 
 by those swift messengers returned from thee 
 who even but now come back again assured 
 of thy fair health , recounting it to me 
 this told , i joy , but then no longer glad 
 i send them back again and straight grow sad 

but being care , thou flyest me as ill fortune 
 care the consuming canker of the mind 
 the discord that disorders sweet hearts ’ tune 
 th ’ abortive bastard of a coward mind 
 the lightfoot lackey that runs post by death 
 bearing the letters which contain our end 
 the busy advocate that sells his breath 
 denouncing worst to him , is most his friend 
 o dear , this care no interest holds in me 
 but holy care , the guardian of thy fair 
 thine honour 's champion , and thy virtue 's fee 
 the zeal which thee from barbarous times shall bear 
 this care am i ; this care my life hath taken 
 dear to my soul , then leave me not forsaken 

the fairer riddles come from out the night 
 the richer is the world his arms enclose 
 the broader stream the sea with which he flows 
 the weaker , too , is destiny 's blind might 
 the nobler instincts does he prove 
 the smaller he himself , the greater grows his love 
 thus is he led , in still and hidden race 
 by poetry , who strews his path with flowers 
 through ever purer forms , and purer powers 
 through ever higher heights , and fairer grace 
 at length , arrived at the ripe goal of time 
 yet one more inspiration all sublime 
 poetic outburst of man 's latest youth 
 and — he will glide into the arms of truth 

v. vice is a monster of so frightful mien 
 as , to be hated , needs but to be seen 
 yet seen too oft , familiar with her face 
 we first endure , then pity , then embrace 
 but where th ’ extreme of vice , was ne'er agreed 
 ask where 's the north ? at york , ‘ tis on the tweed 
 in scotland , at the orcades ; and there 
 at greenland , zembla , or the lord knows where 
 no creature owns it in the first degree 
 but thinks his neighbour further gone than he 
 even those who dwell beneath its very zone 
 or never feel the rage , or never own 
 what happier natures shrink at with affright 
 the hard inhabitant contends is right 

vast chaos , of eld , was god 's dominion 
 ‘ twas his beloved child , his own first born 
 and he was aged ere the thought of morn 
 shook the sheer steeps of dim oblivion 
 then all the works of darkness being done 
 through countless aeons hopelessly forlorn 
 out to the very utmost verge and bourne 
 god at the last , reluctant , made the sun 
 he loved his darkness still , for it was old 
 he grieved to see his eldest child take flight 
 and when his fiat lux the death knell tolled 
 as the doomed darkness backward by him rolled 
 he snatched a remnant flying into light 
 and strewed it with the stars , and called it night 

as the bright flowers start from their wintry tomb 
 i 've sprung from the depths of futurity 's gloom 
 with the glory of hope on my unshadowed brow 
 but a fear at my heart , earth welcomes me now 
 i come and bear with me a measureless flow 
 of infinite joy and of infinite woe 
 the banquet 's light jest and the penitent prayer 
 the sweet laugh of gladness , the wail of despair 
 the warm words of welcome , and broken farewell 
 the strains of rich music , the funeral knell 
 the fair bridal wreath , and the robe for the dead 
 o how will they meet in the path i shall tread 
 o how will they mingle where'er i pass by 
 as sunshine and storm in the rainbow on high 

carved from the block or cast in clinging mould 
 will grateful memory fondly try her best 
 the mortal vesture from decay to wrest 
 his look shall greet us , calm , but ah , how cold 
 no breath can stir the brazen drapery 's fold 
 no throb can heave the statue 's stony breast 
 “ he is not here , but risen , ” will stand confest 
 in all we miss , in all our eyes behold 
 how nature loved him ! on his placid brow 
 thought 's ample dome , she set the sacred sign 
 that marks the priesthood of her holiest shrine 
 nor asked a leaflet from the laurel 's bough 
 that envious time might clutch or disallow 
 to prove her chosen minstrel 's song divine 

for mahomet may dream of heavenly stews 
 where virgin rose , soon as it 's lost , renews 
 and shake with every breath of air serene 
 as trembling for the rapes they 've daily seen 
 when if those past can shake their height profound 
 ridotto sure will fell them to the ground 
 here art to nature join 'd makes it compleat 
 and pyramids and trees together meet 
 statues amidst the thickest grove arise 
 and lofty columns tow'ring to the skies 
 then next an obelisk its shade displays 
 and rustic rockwork fills each empty space 
 each joins to make it noble , and excells 
 beaufets for food , grotto 's for something else 

nor less when spring had warmed the cultured vale , [ c 
 moved we as plunderers where the mother bird 
 had in high places built her lodge ; though mean 
 our object and inglorious , yet the end 
 was not ignoble . oh ! when i have hung 
 above the raven 's nest , by knots of grass 
 and half inch fissures in the slippery rock 
 but ill sustained , and almost ( so it seemed 
 suspended by the blast that blew amain 
 shouldering the naked crag , [ d ] oh , at that time 
 while on the perilous ridge i hung alone 
 with what strange utterance did the loud dry wind 
 blow through my ear ! the sky seemed not a sky 
 of earth — and with what motion moved the clouds 

when thus fresh meat they have obtain 'd with glee 
 the largest beasts the hunters bear to me 
 from which we separate and cast aside 
 whatever beast by frontal wound has died 
 to those the preference we at once decree 
 in whose left side the fatal mark we see 
 those to be offer 'd to our fathers ’ manes 
 within their high and consecrated fanes 
 to dry and cure in wooden trays are laid 
 till bak 'd or roast the offering is made 
 our guests they dine on the rejected prey 
 and what they leave is safely stor 'd away 
 the gross amount of what is slain and shot 
 falls to the carmen and the rabble 's lot 

a dimness of a glory glimmers here 
 thro ’ veils and distance from the space remote 
 a faintest far vibration of a note 
 reaches to us and seems to bring us near 
 causing our face to glow with braver cheer 
 making the serried mist to stand afloat 
 subduing langour with an antidote 
 and strengthening love almost to cast out fear 
 till for one moment golden city walls 
 rise looming on us , golden walls of home 
 light of our eyes until the darkness falls 
 then thro ’ the outer darkness burdensome 
 i hear again the tender voice that calls 
 ‘ follow me hither , follow , rise , and come 

“ o plant ! from whence i spring ! rever 'd and lov 'd 
 who soar'st so high a pitch , thou seest as clear 
 as earthly thought determines two obtuse 
 in one triangle not contain 'd , so clear 
 dost see contingencies , ere in themselves 
 existent , looking at the point whereto 
 all times are present , i , the whilst i scal 'd 
 with virgil the soul purifying mount 
 and visited the nether world of woe 
 touching my future destiny have heard 
 words grievous , though i feel me on all sides 
 well squar 'd to fortune 's blows . therefore my will 
 were satisfied to know the lot awaits me 
 the arrow , seen beforehand , slacks its flight 

weary of love , my thoughts of love complained 
 till reason told them there was no such power 
 and bade me view fair beauty 's richest flower 
 to see if there a naked boy remained 
 dear , to thine eyes , eyes that my soul hath pained 
 thoughts turned them back in that unhappy hour 
 to see if love kept there his royal bower 
 for if not there , then no place him contained 
 there was he not , nor boy , nor golden bow 
 yet as thou turned thy chaste fair eye aside 
 a flame of fire did from thine eyelids go 
 which burnt my heart through my sore wounded side 
 then with a sigh , reason made thoughts to cry 
 “ there is no god of love , save that thine eye 

the nodding oxeye bends before the wind 
 the woodbine quakes lest boys their flowers should find 
 and prickly dogrose spite of its array 
 ca n't dare the blossom seeking hand away 
 while thistles wear their heavy knobs of bloom 
 proud as a warhorse wears its haughty plume 
 and by the roadside danger 's self defy 
 on commons where pined sheep and oxen lie 
 in ruddy pomp and ever thronging mood 
 it stands and spreads like danger in a wood 
 and in the village street where meanest weeds 
 ca n't stand untouched to fill their husks with seeds 
 the haughty thistle oer all danger towers 
 in every place the very wasp of flowers 

away they went , and gyges much admired 
 still more than that : in truth his breast was fired 
 for when she moved astonishment was great 
 and ev'ry grace upon her seemed to wait 
 emotion to suppress howe'er he tried 
 since he had promised what he felt to hide 
 to hold his tongue he wished , but that might raise 
 suspicions of designs and mystick ways 
 exaggeration was the better part 
 and from the subject he would never start 
 but fully praised each beauty in detail 
 without appearing any thing to veil 
 gods ! gyges cried , how truly , king , you 're blessed 
 the skin how fair — how charming all the rest 

this the event ! here springs the temple grand 
 whose mighty arches take in all the land 
 its twilight aisles stretch far away and reach 
 ‘ mid lights and shadows which defy my speech 
 and near its portal which morn opened wide 
 grey janitor !— to let in all this tide 
 of prayerful men , most solemnly there stands 
 one recollection , which , for pious hands 
 is ready like the minster 's sculptured vase 
 with holy water for each reverent face 
 and mystic columns , which my fancy views 
 glow in a thousand soft , subduing hues 
 flung through the stained windows of the past in gloom 
 of royal purple o'er our warrior 's tomb 

kate ( in much indignation ) . refused ! i knew it 
 the crass ingratitude of haughty man 
 vested in all the pride of place and power 
 brooks not the aspirations of my sex 
 however just . is't that he fears to yield 
 lest from his laurelled brow the wreath should fall 
 and light on ours ? we may matriculate 
 and graduate — if we can , but he excludes 
 us from the beaten path he takes himself 
 the sun lit heights of steep parnassus 
 reach past the clouds , and we below must stay 
 not that our alpen stocks are weak , or that 
 our breath comes short , but that , forsooth , we wear 
 the petticoat . out on such trash 

“ will you let any moment dip its wing 
 into your heart and find no love of me 
 to tint with deathless dream ” — he said — “ and spring 
 its flight to the dim bourne of memory 
 will you have any grief that can forget 
 how grief should find forgetfulness in love 
 and since your soul in my soul 's zone is set 
 will it sometimes ask other spheres to rove 
 where touch and voice of me shall not be met 
 ah no ! in all the underdeeps of death 
 or overheights of life it still shall be 
 at tryst with mine thro moan or ecstasy 
 in all ! ” ... yet ere a year he 'll draw no breath 
 but is another 's !— will god let it be 

the heroes of the present and the past 
 were puny , vague , and nothingness to thee 
 thou didst a span grasp mighty to the last 
 and strain for glory when thy die was cast 
 that little island , on the atlantic sea 
 was but a dust spot in a lake : thy mind 
 swept space as shoreless as eternity 
 thy giant powers outstript this gaudy age 
 of heroes ; and , as looking at the sun 
 so gazing on thy greatness , made men blind 
 to merits , that had adoration won 
 in olden times . the world was on thy page 
 of victories but a comma . fame could find 
 no parallel , thy greatness to presage 

last night her form the hours of slumber bless 'd 
 whose eyes illumin 'd all my youthful years 
 spirit of dreams , at thy command appears 
 each airy shape , that visiting our rest 
 dismays , perplexes , or delights the breast 
 my pensive heart this kind indulgence cheers 
 bliss , in no waking moment now possess 'd 
 bliss , ask 'd of thee with memory 's thrilling tears 
 nightly i cry , how oft , alas ! in vain 
 give , by thy powers , that airy shapes controul 
 honora to my visions !— ah ! ordain 
 her beauteous lip may wear the smile that stole 
 in years long fled , the sting from every pain 
 show her sweet face , ah show it to my soul 

one judges as the weather dictates ; right 
 the poem is at noon , and wrong at night 
 another judges by a surer gage 
 an author 's principles , or parentage 
 since his great ancestors in flanders fell 
 the poem doubtless must be written well 
 another judges by the writer 's look 
 another judges , for he bought the book 
 some judge , their knack of judging wrong to keep 
 some judge , because it is too soon to sleep 
 thus all will judge , and with one single aim 
 to gain themselves , not give the writer , fame 
 the very best ambitiously advise 
 half to serve you , and half to pass for wise 

look , delia , how w'esteem the half blown rose 
 the image of thy blush , and summer 's honour 
 whilst yet her tender bud doth undisclose 
 that full of beauty time bestows upon her 
 no sooner spreads her glory in the air 
 but straight her wide blown pomp comes to decline 
 she then is scorned that late adorned the fair 
 so fade the roses of those cheeks of thine 
 no april can revive thy withered flowers 
 whose springing grace adorns thy glory now 
 swift speedy time , feathered with flying hours 
 dissolves the beauty of the fairest brow 
 then do not thou such treasure waste in vain 
 but love now whilst thou mayst be loved again 

outside the dusk , but in the little room 
 all is alive with light , which brightly glints 
 on curving cup or the stiff folds of chintz 
 evoking its own whiteness . shadows loom 
 bulging and black , upon the walls , where hang 
 rich coloured plates of beauties that appeal 
 less to the sense of sight than to the feel 
 so moistly satin are their breasts . a pang 
 almost of pain , runs through him when he sees 
 hanging , a homeless marvel , next to these 
 the silken breastplate of a mandarin 
 centuries dead , which he had given her 
 exquisite miracle , when men could spin 
 jay 's wing and belly of the kingfisher

hopeless ! despairless ! like that indian wise 
 free of desire , save no desire to know 
 to gain that sweet nirvana each one tries 
 thinks to assuage soul wearing passion so 
 from the white rest , the ante natal bliss 
 not loth , the wondrous wondering soul awakes 
 now drawn to that illusion , now to this 
 with gathering strength each devious pathway takes 
 till at the noon of life his aims decline 
 evermore earthward bend the tiring eyes 
 evermore earthward , till with no surprise 
 they see nirvana from earth 's bosom shine 
 the still kind mother holds her child again 
 in blank desirelessness without a stain 

if to admire , were to commend my praise 
 might then both thee , thy work and merit raise 
 but , as it is ( the child of ignorance 
 and utter stranger to all ayr of france 
 how can i speak of thy great pains , but err 
 since they can only judge that can confer 
 behold ! the reverend shade of bartus stands 
 before my thought and ( in thy right ) commands 
 that to the world i publish , for him , this 
 bartus doth with thy english now were his 
 so well in that are his inventions wrought 
 as his will now be the translation thought 
 thine the original ; and france shall boast 
 no more those maiden glories she hath lost 

she leans , and there is laughter in the face 
 she turns towards him ; and it seems a door 
 suddenly opened on some desolate place 
 with a burst of light and music . what before 
 was hidden shines in loveliness revealed 
 now first he sees her beautiful , and knows 
 that he must love her ; and the doom is sealed 
 of all his happiness and all the woes 
 that shall be born of pregnant years hereafter 
 the swift poise of a head , a flutter of laughter 
 and love flows in on him , its vastness pent 
 within his narrow life : the pain it brings 
 boundless ; for love is infinite discontent 
 with the poor lonely life of transient things 

i watched them long in my curious dream 
 till they stood by the borders of the stream 
 then , just as i thought , the two ways met 
 but all the brethren were talking yet 
 and would talk on , till the heaving tide 
 carried them over , side by side 
 side by side , for the way was one 
 the toilsome journey of life was done 
 and priest and quaker , and all who died 
 came out alike on the other side 
 no forms , or crosses , or books had they 
 no gowns of silk , or suits of gray 
 no creeds to guide them , or mss 
 for all had put on christ 's righteousness 

night is the true democracy . when day 
 like some great monarch with his train has passed 
 in regal pomp and splendor to the last 
 the stars troop forth along the milky way 
 a jostling crowd , in radiant disarray 
 on heaven 's broad boulevard in pageants vast 
 and things of earth , the hunted and outcast 
 come from their haunts and hiding places ; yea 
 even from the nooks and crannies of the mind 
 visions uncouth and vagrant fancies start 
 and specters of dead joy , that shun the light 
 and impotent regrets and terrors blind 
 each one , in form grotesque , playing its part 
 in the fantastic mardi gras of night 

again columbus turn 'd his anxious eye 
 where britain 's banner waved along the sky 
 and , graced with spoils of many fields of blood 
 cornwallis boastful on a bulwark stood 
 where york and gloster 's rocky towers bestride 
 their parent stream , virginia 's midmost tide 
 he camp 'd his hundred nations , to regain 
 their force , exhausted in the long campaign 
 paused for a moment on a scene so vast 
 to plan the future and review the past 
 thro vanquisht provinces and towns in flame 
 he mark 'd his recent monuments of fame 
 his checker 'd marches , long and various toils 
 and camp well stored with wide collected spoils 

“ may'st thou achieve , ” she said , with earnest eyes 
 bent on her babe , who reached its tender hands 
 to buddh — knowing , belike , as children know 
 more than we deem , and reverencing our lord 
 but he arose — made strong with that pure meat 
 and bent his footsteps where a great tree grew 
 the bodhi tree ( thenceforward in all years 
 never to fade , and ever to be kept 
 in homage of the world ) , beneath whose leaves 
 it was ordained that truth should come to buddh 
 which now the master knew ; wherefore he went 
 with measured pace , steadfast , majestical 
 unto the tree of wisdom . oh , ye worlds 
 rejoice ! our lord wended unto the tree 

god made my lady lovely to behold 
 above the painter 's dream he set her face 
 and wrought her body in divinest grace 
 he touched the brown hair with a sense of gold 
 and in the perfect form he did enfold 
 what was alone as perfect , the sweet heart 
 knowledge most rare to her he did impart 
 and filled with love and worship all her days 
 and then god thought him how it would be well 
 to give her music , and to love he said 
 “ bring thou some minstrel now that he may tell 
 how fair and sweet a thing my hands have made 
 then at love 's call i came , bowed down my head 
 and at his will my lyre grew audible 

in florence once there dwelled a gentle youth 
 who loved a certain beauteous belle with truth 
 o'er all his actions she had full controul 
 to please he would have sold his very soul 
 if she amusements wished , he 'd lavish gold 
 convinced in love or war you should be bold 
 the cash ne'er spare :— invincible its pow'rs 
 o'erturning walls or doors where'er it show'rs 
 the precious ore can every thing o'ercome 
 ‘ twill silence barking curs : make servants dumb 
 and these can render eloquent at will 
 excel e'en tully in persuasive skill 
 in short he 'd leave no quarter unsubdued 
 unless therein the fair he could include 

in robes of tyrian blue the king was drest 
 a jewelled collar shone upon his breast 
 a giant ruby glittered in his crown 
 lord of rich lands and many a splendid town 
 in him the glories of an ancient line 
 of sober kings , who ruled by right divine 
 were centred ; and to him with loyal awe 
 the people looked for leadership and law 
 ten thousand knights , the safeguard of the land 
 lay like a single sword within his hand 
 a hundred courts , with power of life and death 
 proclaimed decrees of justice by his breath 
 and all the sacred growths that men had known 
 of order and of rule upheld his throne 

why didst thou promise such a beauteous day 
 and make me travel forth without my cloak 
 to let base clouds o'ertake me in my way 
 hiding thy brav'ry in their rotten smoke 
 ‘ tis not enough that through the cloud thou break 
 to dry the rain on my storm beaten face 
 for no man well of such a salve can speak 
 that heals the wound , and cures not the disgrace 
 nor can thy shame give physic to my grief 
 though thou repent , yet i have still the loss 
 th ’ offender 's sorrow lends but weak relief 
 to him that bears the strong offence 's cross 
 ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds 
 and they are rich , and ransom all ill deeds 

lord , if i love thee and thou lovest me 
 why need i any more these toilsome days 
 why should i not run singing up thy ways 
 straight into heaven , to rest myself with thee 
 what need remains of death pang yet to be 
 if all my soul is quickened in thy praise 
 if all my heart loves thee , what need the amaze 
 struggle and dimness of an agony 
 bride whom i love , if thou too lovest me 
 thou needs must choose my likeness for thy dower 
 so wilt thou toil in patience , and abide 
 hungering and thirsting for that blessed hour 
 when i my likeness shall behold in thee 
 and thou therein shalt waken satisfied 

so mid the danaans cried a voice : nor yet 
 within the mighty soul of peleus ’ son 
 lulled was the storm of wrath , but fiercely he spake 
 “ lie there in dust , thy follies all forgot 
 ‘ tis not for knaves to beard their betters : once 
 thou didst provoke odysseus ’ steadfast soul 
 babbling with venomous tongue a thousand gibes 
 and didst escape with life ; but thou hast found 
 the son of peleus not so patient souled 
 who with one only buffet from his hand 
 unkennels thy dog 's soul ! a bitter doom 
 hath swallowed thee : by thine own rascalry 
 thy life is sped . hence from achaean men 
 and mouth out thy revilings midst the dead 

she stood before her traitors bound and bare 
 clothed with her wounds and with her naked shame 
 as with a weed of fiery tears and flame 
 their mother land , their common weal and care 
 and they turned from her and denied , and sware 
 they did not know this woman nor her name 
 and they took truce with tyrants and grew tame 
 and gathered up cast crowns and creeds to wear 
 and rags and shards regilded . then she took 
 in her bruised hands their broken pledge , and eyed 
 these men so late so loud upon her side 
 with one inevitable and tearless look 
 that they might see her face whom they forsook 
 and they beheld what they had left , and died 

the stars come out ; the fragrant shadows fall 
 about a dreaming garden still and sweet 
 i hear the unseen bats above me bleat 
 among the ghostly moths their hunting call 
 and twinkling glow worms all about me crawl 
 now for a chamber dim , a pillow meet 
 for slumbers deep as death , a faultless sheet 
 cool , white and smooth . so may i reach the hall 
 with poppies strewn where sleep that is so dear 
 with magic sponge can wipe away an hour 
 or twelve and make them naught . why not a year 
 why could a man not loiter in that bower 
 until a thousand painless cycles wore 
 and then what if it held him evermore 

avenge , o lord , thy slaughtered saints , whose bones 
 lie scattered on the alpine mountains cold 
 even them who kept thy truth so pure of old 
 when all our fathers worshipped stocks and stones 
 forget not : in thy book record their groans 
 who were thy sheep , and in their ancient fold 
 slain by the bloody piedmontese that rolled 
 mother with infant down the rocks . their moans 
 the vales redoubled to the hills , and they 
 to heaven . their martyred blood and ashes sow 
 o'er all the italian fields , where still doth sway 
 the triple tyrant ; that from these may grow 
 a hundredfold , who , having learnt thy way 
 early may fly the babylonian woe 

lyre of the sonnet , that full many a time 
 amus 'd my lassitude , and sooth 'd my pains 
 when graver cares forbade the lengthen 'd strains 
 to thy brief bound , and oft returning chime 
 a long farewell !— the splendid forms of rhyme 
 when grief in lonely orphanism reigns 
 oppress the drooping soul .— death 's dark domains 
 throw mournful shadows o'er the aonian clime 
 for in their silent bourne my filial bands 
 lie all dissolv 'd ;— and swiftly wasting pour 
 from my frail glass of life , health 's sparkling sands 
 sleep then , my lyre , thy tuneful tasks are o'er 
 sleep ! for my heart bereav 'd , and listless hands 
 wake with rapt touch thy glowing strings no more 

needs must i leave and yet needs must i love 
 in vain my wit doth tell in verse my woe 
 despair in me , disdain in thee , doth show 
 how by my wit i do my folly prove 
 all this my heart from love can never move 
 love is not in my heart . no , lady , no 
 my heart is love itself . till i forego 
 my heart i never can my love remove 
 how can i then leave love ? i do intend 
 not to crave grace , but yet to wish it still 
 not to praise thee , but beauty to commend 
 and so , by beauty 's praise , praise thee i will 
 for as my heart is love , love not in me 
 so beauty thou , beauty is not in thee

a tide of beauty with returning may 
 floods the fair city ; from warm pavements fume 
 odors endeared ; down avenues in bloom 
 the chestnut trees with phallic spires are gay 
 over the terrace flows the thronged cafe 
 the boulevards are streams of hurrying sound 
 and through the streets , like veins when they abound 
 the lust for pleasure throbs itself away 
 here let me live , here let me still pursue 
 phantoms of bliss that beckon and recede 
 thy strange allurements , city that i love 
 maze of romance , where i have followed too 
 the dream youth treasures of its dearest need 
 and stars beyond thy towers bring tidings of 

when old jack died , it seemed to us , some way 
 that all the other dogs in town were pained 
 with our bereavement , and some that were chained 
 even , unslipped their collars on that day 
 to visit jack in state , as though to pay 
 a last , sad tribute there , while neighbors craned 
 their heads above the high board fence , and deigned 
 to sigh “ poor dog ! ” remembering how they 
 had cuffed him , when alive , perchance , because 
 for love of them he leaped to lick their hands 
 now , that he could not , were they satisfied 
 we children thought that , as we crossed his paws 
 and o'er his grave , ‘ way down the bottom lands 
 wrote “ our first love lies here , ” when old jack died 

xii . and by such living witness didst thou preach 
 not with blind hands of groping forward thrust 
 into the darkness , gathering only dust 
 but by this real sign — that thou didst reach 
 in natural order , rising each from each 
 thy own ideals of the true and just 
 and that as thou didst live , even so he must 
 who would aspire his fellow men to teach 
 looking perpetual from new heights of thought 
 on his old self . of art no scorner thou 
 instead of leafy chaplet , on thy brow 
 wearing the light of manhood , thou hast brought 
 death unto life ! above all statues now 
 immortal artist , hail ! thy work is wrought 

i must not grieve , my love , whose eyes would read 
 lines of delight , whereon her youth might smile 
 flowers have time before they come to seed 
 and she is young , and now must sport the while 
 and sport , sweet maid , in season of these years 
 and learn to gather flowers before they wither 
 and where the sweetest blossom first appears 
 let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither 
 lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air 
 and calm the tempest which my sighs do raise 
 pity and smiles do best become the fair 
 pity and smiles must only yield thee praise 
 make me to say , when all my griefs are gone 
 happy the heart that sigh 'd for such a one 

too , too prophetic did thy wild note swell 
 impassion 'd minstrel ! when its pitying wail 
 sigh 'd o'er the vernal primrose as it fell 
 untimely , wither 'd by the northern gale 
 thou wert that flower of promise and of prime 
 whose opening bloom , ‘ mid many an adverse blast 
 charm 'd the lone wanderer through this desert clime 
 but charm 'd him with a rapture soon o'ercast 
 to see thee languish into quick decay 
 yet was not thy departing immature 
 for ripe in virtue thou wert reft away 
 and pure in spirit , as the bless 'd are pure 
 pure as the dewdrop , freed from earthly leaven 
 that sparkles , is exhaled , and blends with heaven 

poor soul the centre of my sinful earth 
 my sinful earth these rebel powers array 
 why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth 
 painting thy outward walls so costly gay 
 why so large cost having so short a lease 
 dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend 
 shall worms inheritors of this excess 
 eat up thy charge ? is this thy body 's end 
 then soul live thou upon thy servant 's loss 
 and let that pine to aggravate thy store 
 buy terms divine in selling hours of dross 
 within be fed , without be rich no more 
 so shall thou feed on death , that feeds on men 
 and death once dead , there 's no more dying then 

o for my sake do you with fortune chide 
 the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds 
 that did not better for my life provide 
 than public means which public manners breeds 
 thence comes it that my name receives a brand 
 and almost thence my nature is subdued 
 to what it works in , like the dyer 's hand 
 pity me then , and wish i were renewed 
 whilst like a willing patient i will drink 
 potions of eisel ‘ gainst my strong infection 
 no bitterness that i will bitter think 
 nor double penance to correct correction 
 pity me then dear friend , and i assure ye 
 even that your pity is enough to cure me 

the stately beast the two tyrrhidae bred 
 snatch 'd from his dams , and the tame youngling fed

 the little wanton , and did wreaths prepare 
 to hang his budding horns , with ribbons tied 
 his tender neck , and comb 'd his silken hide 
 and bathed his body . patient of command 
 in time he grew , and , growing us 'd to hand 
 he waited at his master 's board for food 
 then sought his salvage kindred in the wood 
 where grazing all the day , at night he came 
 to his known lodgings , and his country dame 

hark ! how the bitter winter breezes blow 
 round the sharp rocks and o'er the half lifted wave 
 while all the rocky woodland branches rave 
 shrill with the piercing cold , and every cave 
 along the icy water margin low 
 rings bubbling with the whirling overflow 
 and sharp the echoes answer distant cries 
 of dawning daylight and the dim sunrise 
 and the gloom coloured clouds that stain the skies 
 with pictures of a warmth , and frozen glow 
 spread over endless fields of sheeted snow 
 and white untrodden mountains shining cold 
 and muffled footpaths winding thro ’ the wold 
 o'er which those wintry gusts cease not to howl and blow 

“ o plant ! from whence i spring ! rever 'd and lov 'd 
 who soar'st so high a pitch , thou seest as clear 
 as earthly thought determines two obtuse

 some moody moment of his mortal part 
 no man doth nature make whose trust doth ever

 with no contentment can themselves suffize 
 but having , pine , and having not , complaine 
 for lacking it , they cannot lyfe sustayne 
 and having it , they gaze on it the more 
 in their amazement lyke narcissus vaine 
 whose eyes him starv 'd : so plenty makes me poore 
 yet are mine eyes so filled with the store 
 of that faire sight , that nothing else they brooke 
 but lothe the things which they did like before 
 and can no more endure on them to looke 
 all this worlds glory seemeth vayne to me

behind the palace lay a maidan wide 
 for exercise in arms and manly sports 
 its sides bordered by gently rising hills 
 where at their ease the city 's myriads sat 
 under the shade of high pruned spreading trees 
 fanned by cool breezes from the snow capped peaks 
 while north , and next the lake , a stately dome 
 stood out , on slender , graceful columns raised 
 with seats , rank above rank , in order placed 
 the throne above , and near the throne were bowers 
 of slender lattice work , with trailing vines 
 thick set with flowers of every varied tint 
 breathing perfumes , where beauty 's champions 
 might sit , unseen of all yet seeing all 

he rose — and slowly , sternly thence withdrew 
 rage in his eye , and threats in his adieu 
 ah ! little recked that chief of womanhood 
 which frowns ne'er quelled , nor menaces subdued 
 and little deemed he what thy heart , gulnare 
 when soft could feel — and when incensed could dare 
 his doubts appeared to wrong — nor yet she knew 
 how deep the root from whence compassion grew 
 she was a slave — from such may captives claim 
 a fellow feeling , differing but in name 
 still half unconscious — heedless of his wrath 
 again she ventured on the dangerous path 
 again his rage repelled — until arose 
 that strife of thought , the source of woman 's woes 

“ we went , ulysses ! ( such was thy command 
 through the lone thicket and the desert land 
 a palace in a woody vale we found 
 brown with dark forests , and with shades around 
 a voice celestial echoed through the dome 
 or nymph or goddess , chanting to the loom 
 access we sought , nor was access denied 
 radiant she came : the portals open 'd wide 
 the goddess mild invites the guests to stay 
 they blindly follow where she leads the way 
 i only wait behind of all the train 
 i waited long , and eyed the doors in vain 
 the rest are vanish 'd , none repass 'd the gate 
 and not a man appears to tell their fate 

lift up your eyes ! behold these pictured walls 
 look where the flood of western glory falls 
 through the great sunflower disk of blazing panes 
 in ruby , saffron , azure , emerald stains 
 with reverent step the marble pavement tread 
 where our proud mother 's martyr roll is read 
 see the great halls that cluster , gathering round 
 this lofty shrine with holiest memories crowned 
 see the fair matron in her summer bower 
 fresh as a rose in bright perennial flower 
 read on her standard , always in the van 
 “ truth , ” — the one word that makes a slave a man 
 think whose the hands that fed her altar fires 
 then count the debt we owe our scholar sires 

how sweet the tuneful bells ’ responsive peal 
 as when , at opening morn , the fragrant breeze 
 breathes on the trembling sense of pale disease 
 so piercing to my heart their force i feel 
 and hark ! with lessening cadence now they fall 
 and now , along the white and level tide 
 they fling their melancholy music wide 
 bidding me many a tender thought recall 
 of summer days , and those delightful years 
 when from an ancient tower , in life 's fair prime 
 the mournful magic of their mingling chime 
 first waked my wondering childhood into tears 
 but seeming now , when all those days are o'er 
 the sounds of joy once heard , and heard no more 

when forty winters shall besiege thy brow 
 and dig deep trenches in thy beauty 's field 
 thy youth 's proud livery so gazed on now 
 will be a tattered weed of small worth held 
 then being asked , where all thy beauty lies 
 where all the treasure of thy lusty days 
 to say within thine own deep sunken eyes 
 were an all eating shame , and thriftless praise 
 how much more praise deserved thy beauty 's use 
 if thou couldst answer ‘ this fair child of mine 
 shall sum my count , and make my old excuse 
 proving his beauty by succession thine 
 this were to be new made when thou art old 
 and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold 

the kind instructor in these words began 
 “ ere farther thou proceed , know thou art now 
 i ’ th ’ second round , and shalt be , till thou come 
 upon the horrid sand : look therefore well 
 around thee , and such things thou shalt behold 
 as would my speech discredit . ” on all sides 
 i heard sad plainings breathe , and none could see 
 from whom they might have issu 'd . in amaze 
 fast bound i stood . he , as it seem 'd , believ 'd 
 that i had thought so many voices came 
 from some amid those thickets close conceal 'd 
 and thus his speech resum 'd : “ if thou lop off 
 a single twig from one of those ill plants 
 the thought thou hast conceiv 'd shall vanish quite 

the kingly bird that beares ioves thunder clap 
 one day did scorne the simple scarabee 
 proud of his highest service and good hap 
 that made all other foules his thralls to bee 
 the silly flie , that no redresse did see 
 spide where the eagle built his towring nest 
 and , kindling fire within the hollow tree 
 burnt up his yong ones , and himselfe distrest 
 ne suffred him in anie place to rest 
 but drove in ioves owne lap his egs to lay 
 where gathering also filth him to infest 
 forst with the filth his egs to fling away 
 for which , when as the foule was wroth , said iove 
 “ lo ! how the least the greatest may reprove 

how beautiful !— was this not one of eld 
 that chaos on his boundless bosom held 
 till earth came forward in a rush of storm 
 closing his ribs upon her wingless form 
 how beautiful !— the very lips do speak 
 of love , and bid us worship : the pale cheek 
 seems blushing through the marble — through the snow 
 and the undrap'ried bosom feels a flow 
 of fever on its brightness ; every vein 
 at the blue pulse swells softly , like a chain 
 of gentle hills . i would not fling a wreath 
 of jewels on that brow , to flash beneath 
 those queenly tresses ; for itself is more 
 than sea born pearl of some elysian shore 

unchanged within , to see all changed without 
 is a blank lot and hard to bear , no doubt 
 yet why at others ’ wanings should'st thou fret 
 then only might'st thou feel a just regret 
 hadst thou withheld thy love or hid thy light 
 in selfish forethought of neglect and slight 
 o wiselier then , from feeble yearnings freed 
 while , and on whom , thou may'st — shine on ! nor heed 
 whether the object by reflected light 
 return thy radiance or absorb it quite 
 and though thou notest from thy safe recess 
 old friends burn dim , like lamps in noisome air 
 love them for what they are ; nor love them less 
 because to thee they are not what they were 

where fair ææ ia smiles across the sea 
 to olive crowned italia , th ’ enchantress dwells 
 a woman set about with dreams and spells 
 weird incantations , charms and mystery 
 most strangely pale and strangely fair is she 
 yet deadlier than the hemlock draught her smile 
 darker than stygian glooms her subtle guile 
 drawn by her deep eyes ’ spell , across the sea

lyke as a huntsman , after weary chace 
 seeing the game from him escapt away 
 sits downe to rest him in some shady place 
 with panting hounds , beguiled of their pray 
 so , after long pursuit and vaine assay 
 when i all weary had the chace forsooke 
 the gentle deer returnd the selfe same way 
 thinking to quench her thirst at the next brooke 
 there she , beholding me with mylder looke 
 sought not to fly , but fearlesse still did bide 
 till i in hand her yet halfe trembling tooke 
 and with her own goodwill her fyrmely tyde 
 strange thing , me seemd , to see a beast so wyld 
 so goodly wonne , with her owne will beguyld 

the morning road is thronged with merry boys 
 who seek the water for their sunday joys 
 they run to seek the shallow pit , and wade 
 and dance about the water in the shade 
 the boldest ventures first and dashes in 
 and others go and follow to the chin 
 and duck about , and try to lose their fears 
 and laugh to hear the thunder in their ears 
 they bundle up the rushes for a boat 
 and try across the deepest place to float 
 beneath the willow trees they ride and stoop 
 the awkward load will scarcely bear them up 
 without their aid the others float away 
 and play about the water half the day 

with arms and legs at work and gentle stroke 
 that urges switching tail nor mends his pace 
 on an old ribbed and weather beaten horse 
 the farmer goes jogtrotting to the fair 
 both keep their pace that nothing can provoke 
 followed by brindled dog that snuffs the ground 
 with urging bark and hurries at his heels 
 his hat slouched down , and great coat buttoned close 
 bellied like hooped keg , and chuffy face 
 red as the morning sun , he takes his round 
 and talks of stock : and when his jobs are done 
 and dobbin 's hay is eaten from the rack 
 he drinks success to corn in language hoarse 
 and claps old dobbin 's hide , and potters back 

what it is to breathe and live without life 
 how to be pale with anguish , red with fear 
 t'have peace abroad , and nought within but strife 
 wish to be present , and yet shun t'appear 
 how to be bold far off , and bashful near 
 how to think much , and have no words to speak 
 to crave redress , yet hold affliction dear 
 to have affection strong , a body weak 
 never to find , yet evermore to seek 
 and seek that which i dare not hope to find 
 t'affect this life and yet this life disleek 
 grateful t'another , to myself unkind 
 this cruel knowledge of these contraries 
 delia , my heart hath learned out of those eyes 

then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes 
 and looked at sir launfal , and straightway he 
 remembered in what a haughtier guise 
 he had flung an alms to leprosie 
 when he caged his young life up in gilded mail 
 and set forth in search of the holy grail 
 the heart within him was ashes and dust 
 he parted in twain his single crust 
 he broke the ice on the streamlet 's brink 
 and gave the leper to eat and drink 
 ‘ twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread 
 ‘ twas water out of a wooden bowl 
 yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed 
 and ‘ twas red wine he drank with his thirsty soul 

was it the moon , or was it morning 's ray 
 that call 'd thee , dearest , from these arms away 
 scarce hadst thou left me , when a dream of night 
 came o'er my spirit so distinct and bright 
 that , while i yet can vividly recall 
 its witching wonders , thou shall hear them all 
 methought i saw , upon the lunar beam 
 two winged boys , such as thy muse might dream 
 descending from above , at that still hour 
 and gliding , with smooth step , into my bower 
 fair as the beauteous spirits that , all day 
 in amatha 's warm founts imprisoned stay 
 but rise at midnight , from the enchanted rill 
 to cool their plumes upon some moonlight hill 

` now loke that atempre be thy brydel

if that my sensual deed had stol'n from thee 
 aught that were part of thy most precious love 
 or made to swerve the loving soul of me 
 that to thy service it should duller prove 
 had't made to me thy grace less gracious seem 
 thy worth less worth , thy love a smaller prize 
 or bated aught of thy most rich esteem 
 which still grew richer in thy servant 's eyes 
 then were it fault too foul to find excuse 
 and all i writ of thee were vows untrue 
 my verse were nought but idle poet 's use 
 conceit 's worn weeds lac 'd o'er with wording new 
 but ‘ twas not so ; though true my love before 
 ‘ twas thenceforth purg 'd , and priz 'd thee all the more 

one of my wishes is that those dark trees 
 so old and firm they scarcely show the breeze 
 were not , as ‘ twere , the merest mask of gloom 
 but stretched away unto the edge of doom 
 i should not be withheld but that some day 
 into their vastness i should steal away 
 fearless of ever finding open land 
 or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand 
 i do not see why i should e'er turn back 
 or those should not set forth upon my track 
 to overtake me , who should miss me here 
 and long to know if still i held them dear 
 they would not find me changed from him they knew 
 only more sure of all i thought was true

the castle gate stands open now 
 and the wanderer is welcome to the hall 
 as the hangbird is to the elm tree bough 
 no longer scowl the turrets tall 
 the summer 's long siege at last is o'er 
 when the first poor outcast went in at the door 
 she entered with him in disguise 
 and mastered the fortress by surprise 
 there is no spot she loves so well on ground 
 she lingers and smiles there the whole year round 
 the meanest serf on sir launfal 's land 
 has hall and bower at his command 
 and there 's no poor man in the north countree 
 but is lord of the earldom as much as he 

“ teacups , arouse ! ” ‘ t was thus the spell i broke 
 the drowsy started and the slumberers woke 
 “ the sleep i promised you have now enjoyed 
 due to your hour of labor well employed 
 swiftly the busy moments have been passed 
 this , our first ‘ teacups , ’ must not be our last 
 here , on this spot , now consecrated ground 
 the order of ‘ the teacups ’ let us found 
 by winter 's fireside and in summer 's bower 
 still shall it claim its ever welcome hour 
 in distant regions where our feet may roam 
 the magic teapot find or make a home 
 long may its floods their bright infusion pour 
 till time and teacups both shall be no more 

oh , had we room to rip the mighty bags 
 that time , the harlequin , has stuffed with rags 
 grant us one moment to unloose the strings 
 while the old graybeard shuts his leather wings 
 but what a heap of motley trash appears 
 crammed in the bundles of successive years 
 as the lost rustic on some festal day 
 stares through the concourse in its vast array 
 where in one cake a throng of faces runs 
 all stuck together like a sheet of buns 
 and throws the bait of some unheeded name 
 or shoots a wink with most uncertain aim 
 so roams my vision , wandering over all 
 and strives to choose , but knows not where to fall 

ingratitude , how deadly is thy smart 
 proceeding from the form we fondly love 
 how light , compared , all other sorrows prove 
 thou shed'st a night of woe , from whence depart 
 the gentle beams of patience , that the heart 
 ‘ mid lesser ills , illume .— thy victims rove 
 unquiet as the ghost that haunts the grove 
 where murder spilt the life blood .— o ! thy dart 
 kills more than life ,— e'en all that makes life dear 
 till we “ the sensible of pain ” wou 'd change 
 for phrenzy , that defies the bitter tear 
 or wish , in kindred callousness , to range 
 where moon ey 'd idiocy , with fallen lip 
 drags the loose knee , and intermitting step 

retreating and beating and meeting and sheeting 
 delaying and straying and playing and spraying 
 advancing and prancing and glancing and dancing 
 recoiling , turmoiling and toiling and boiling 
 and gleaming and streaming and steaming and beaming 
 and rushing and flushing and brushing and gushing 
 and flapping and rapping and clapping and slapping 
 and curling and whirling and purling and twirling 
 and thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping 
 and dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing 
 and so never ending , but always descending 
 sounds and motions for ever and ever are blending 
 all at once and all o'er , with a mighty uproar

one might believe that natural miseries 
 had blasted france , and made of it a land 
 unfit for men ; and that in one great band 
 her sons were bursting forth , to dwell at ease 
 but ‘ tis a chosen soil , where sun and breeze 
 shed gentle favors ; rural works are there 
 and ordinary business without care 
 spot rich in all things that can soothe and please 
 how piteous then that there should be such dearth 
 of knowledge ; that whole myriads should unite 
 to work against themselves such fell despite 
 should come in phrenzy and in drunken mirth 
 impatient to put out the only light 
 of liberty that yet remains on earth 

among the ruffians that , allured by gain 
 lurk 'd round the dwellings of the royal dane 
 the horrid eminence a swede might claim 
 a lawless wretch — olaus was his name 
 his name , with darkest brand exalted high 
 glared on the towering pitch of infamy 
 twice , o'er his head ere thirty suns had roll 'd 
 with shameless hand his freedom had he sold 
 and twice in battle drawn his venal sword 
 against a generous and forgiving lord

 and denmark 's king the perfect villain hail 'd

all woes of all men sat upon thy soul 
 and all their wrongs were heavy on thy head 
 with all their wounds thy heart was pierced and bled 
 and in thy spirit as in a mourning scroll 
 the world 's huge sorrows were inscribed by roll 
 all theirs on earth who serve and faint for bread 
 all banished men 's , all theirs in prison dead 
 thy love had heart and sword hand for the whole 
 “ this was my day of glory , ” didst thou say 
 when , by the scaffold thou hadst hope to climb 
 for thy faith 's sake , they brought thee respite ; “ nay 
 i shall not die then , i have missed my day 
 o hero , o our help , o head sublime 
 thy day shall be commensurate with time 

he knows the sweet vexation in the strife 
 of love with time , this bard who fain would stray 
 to fairer place beyond the storms of life 
 with astral faces near him day by day 
 in deep mossed dells the mellow waters flow 
 which best he loves ; for there the echoes , rife 
 with rich suggestions of his long ago 
 astarte , pass with thee ! and , far away 
 dear southern seasons haunt the dreamy eye 
 spring , flower zoned , and summer , warbling low 
 in tasselled corn , alternate come and go 
 while gypsy autumn , splashed from heel to thigh 
 with vine blood , treads the leaves ; and , halting nigh 
 wild winter bends across a beard of snow 

the flower that 's gathered beauty soon forsakes 
 the bliss grows feeble as we gain the prize 
 love dreams of joy , and in possession wakes 
 scarce time enough to hail it ere it dies 
 life intermingles , with its cares and sighs 
 and rapture 's dreams are ended . heavenly flower 
 it is not so with thee ! still fancy 's power 
 throws rainbow halos round thee , and thine eyes 
 that once did steal their sapphire blue from even 
 are beaming on ; thy cheeks ’ bewitching dye 
 where partial roses all their blooms had given 
 still in fond memory with the rose can vie 
 and thy sweet bosom , which to view was heaven 
 no lily yet a fairer hue supplies 

a thousand times to think and think the same 
 to two fair eyes to show a naked heart 
 great thirst with bitter liquor to restrain 
 to take repast of care and crooked smart 
 to sigh full oft without relent of ire 
 to die for grief and yet conceal the tale 
 to others ’ will to fashion my desire 
 to pine in looks disguised through pensive pale 
 a short dispite , a faith unfeign è d true 
 to love my foe , and set my life at naught 
 with heedless eyes mine endless harms to view 
 a will to speak , a fear to tell the thought 
 to hope for all , yet for despair to die 
 is of my life the certain destiny 

the goldfinch , who , to shun the scalding heat 
 had changed the medlar for a safer seat 
 and hid in bushes ‘ scaped the bitter shower 
 now perch 'd upon the lady of the flower 
 and either songster holding out their throats 
 and folding up their wings , renew 'd their notes 
 as if all day , precluding to the fight 
 they only had rehearsed , to sing by night 
 the banquet ended , and the battle done 
 they danced by star light and the friendly moon 
 and when they were to part , the laureate queen 
 supplied with steeds the lady of the green 
 her and her train conducting on the way 
 the moon to follow , and avoid the day 

when most i wink then do mine eyes best see 
 for all the day they view things unrespected 
 but when i sleep , in dreams they look on thee 
 and darkly bright , are bright in dark directed 
 then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright 
 how would thy shadow 's form , form happy show 
 to the clear day with thy much clearer light 
 when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so 
 how would ( i say ) mine eyes be blessed made 
 by looking on thee in the living day 
 when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade 
 through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay 
 all days are nights to see till i see thee 
 and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me

well , honest john , how fare you now at home

 the old cock robin to the stye is come 
 with olive feathers and its ruddy breast 
 and the old cock , with wattles and red comb 
 struts with the hens , and seems to like some best 
 then crows , and looks about for little crumbs 
 swept out by little folks an hour ago 
 the pigs sleep in the stye ; the bookman comes 
 the little boy lets home close nesting go

feronde , a rich , but awkward , vulgar clown 
 a ninny was believed throughout the town 
 he had the charge of revenues not slight 
 which he collected for a friar white 
 of these i 've known as good as any black

 and had so much to do , they monks might need

a ladder , which my ken pursued in vain 
 so lofty was the summit ; down whose steps 
 i saw the splendours in such multitude 
 descending , ev'ry light in heav'n , methought 
 was shed thence . as the rooks , at dawn of day 
 bestirring them to dry their feathers chill 
 some speed their way a field , and homeward some

and now a shadow and a terror fell 
 on the great house , as if a passing bell 
 tolled from the tower , and filled each spacious room 
 with secret awe , and preternatural gloom

 pined with mysterious malady away 
 the mother 's heart would not be comforted 
 her darling seemed to her already dead 
 and often , sitting by the sufferer 's side

 o no , it is that other gentle bird

 and it did burn me ,— oh , most fearfully

 with matchless strength ; that time ulysses found 
 the strength to evade , and where the nerves combine

 ulysses , following , on his bosom lies 
 shouts of applause run rattling through the skies 
 ajax to lift ulysses next essays

 his knee lock ’ d fast , the foe ’ s attempt denied

the heavenly branches did i see arise 
 out of the fresh and lustie lawrell tree 
 amidst the yong greene wood : of paradise 
 some noble plant i thought my selfe to see

 chaunting in shade their sundrie melodie 
 that with their sweetnes i was ravish't nere

 the skie gan everie where to overcast

 her bosom beats ,— i see the blue eyes beam 
 i think she kissed these lips , for now they seem 
 scarce mine : so hallowed of the lips they pressed 
 yon thicket 's breath — can that be eglantine 
 those birds — can they be morning 's choristers 
 can this be earth ? can these be banks of furze 
 like burning bushes fired of god they shine 
 i seem to know them , though this body of mine 
 passed into spirit at the touch of hers

 art 's cumberous works , and empires , from their base 
 while each young hour its sickle fine employs 
 and crops the sweet buds of domestic joys 

whilst by thy eyes pursued , my poor heart flew 
 into the sacred refuge of thy breast 
 thy rigour in that sanctuary slew 
 that which thy succ'ring mercy should have blest 
 no privilege of faith could it protect 
 faith being with blood and five years witness signed 
 wherein no show gave cause of least suspect 
 for well thou saw'st my love and how i pined 
 yet no mild comfort would thy brow reveal 
 no lightning looks which falling hopes erect 
 what boots to laws of succour to appeal 
 ladies and tyrants never laws respect 
 then there i die from whence my life should come 
 and by that hand whom such deeds ill become 

fraud shrinks from faith : at sight of swans , the raven 
 chides blackness , and the snake recoils aghast 
 in fear of poison when a bird flies past 
 thersites brands achilles as a craven 
 the shoal fed full with shipwreck blames the haven 
 for murderous lust of lives devoured , and vast 
 desire of doom whose feast is mercy 's fast 
 and bacon sees the traitor 's mark engraven 
 full on the front of essex . grief and shame 
 obscure the chaste and sunlike spirit of oates 
 at thought of russell 's treason ; and the name 
 of milton sickens with superb disgust 
 the heaving heart of waller . wisdom dotes 
 if wisdom turns not tail and licks not dust 

meek twilight ! soften the declining day 
 and bring the hour my pensive spirit loves 
 when , o'er the mountain flow descends the ray 
 that gives to silence the deserted groves 
 ah , let the happy court the morning still 
 when , in her blooming loveliness array 'd 
 she bids fresh beauty light the vale , or hill 
 and rapture warble in the vocal shade 
 sweet is the odour of the morning 's flower 
 and rich in melody her accents rise 
 yet dearer to my soul the shadowy hour 
 at which her blossoms close , her music dies 
 for then , while languid nature droops her head 
 she wakes the tear ‘ tis luxury to shed 

he paused for breath : i falteringly strike in 
 “ have you a mother ? have you kith or kin 
 to whom your life is precious ? ” “ not a soul 
 my line 's extinct : i have interred the whole 
 o happy they ! ( so into thought i fell 
 after life 's endless babble they sleep well 
 my turn is next : dispatch me : for the weird 
 has come to pass which i so long have feared 
 the fatal weird a sabine beldame sung 
 all in my nursery days , when life was young 
 “ no sword nor poison e'er shall take him off 
 nor gout , nor pleurisy , nor racking cough 
 a babbling tongue shall kill him : let him fly 
 all talkers , as he wishes not to die 

the kind instructor in these words began 
 “ ere farther thou proceed , know thou art now 
 i ’ th ’ second round , and shalt be , till thou come 
 upon the horrid sand : look therefore well 
 around thee , and such things thou shalt behold 
 as would my speech discredit . ” on all sides 
 i heard sad plainings breathe , and none could see 
 from whom they might have issu 'd . in amaze 
 fast bound i stood . he , as it seem 'd , believ 'd 
 that i had thought so many voices came 
 from some amid those thickets close conceal 'd 
 and thus his speech resum 'd : “ if thou lop off 
 a single twig from one of those ill plants 
 the thought thou hast conceiv 'd shall vanish quite 

“ the angels , o my brother ! and this clime 
 wherein thou art , impassible and pure 
 i call created , as indeed they are 
 in their whole being . but the elements 
 which thou hast nam 'd , and what of them is made 
 are by created virtue ’ inform 'd : create 
 their substance , and create the ’ informing virtue 
 in these bright stars , that round them circling move 
 the soul of every brute and of each plant 
 the ray and motion of the sacred lights 
 with complex potency attract and turn 
 but this our life the ’ eternal good inspires 
 immediate , and enamours of itself 
 so that our wishes rest for ever here 

what shall i say to you ? what can i say 
 better than silence is ? when i survey 
 this throng of faces turned to meet my own 
 friendly and fair , and yet to me unknown 
 transformed the very landscape seems to be 
 it is the same , yet not the same to me 
 so many memories crowd upon my brain 
 so many ghosts are in the wooded plain 
 i fain would steal away , with noiseless tread 
 as from a house where some one lieth dead 
 i cannot go ;— i pause ;— i hesitate 
 my feet reluctant linger at the gate 
 as one who struggles in a troubled dream 
 to speak and cannot , to myself i seem 

how do i love thee ? let me count the ways 
 i love thee to the depth and breadth and height 
 my soul can reach , when feeling out of sight 
 for the ends of being and ideal grace 
 i love thee to the level of everyday 's 
 most quiet need , by sun and candlelight 
 i love thee freely , as men strive for right 
 i love thee purely , as they turn from praise 
 i love thee with the passion put to use 
 in my old griefs , and with my childhood 's faith 
 i love thee with a love i seemed to lose 
 with my lost saints ,— i love thee with the breath 
 smiles , tears , of all my life !— and , if god choose 
 i shall but love thee better after death 

while the long night extends her sable reign 
 around patroclus mourn ’ d the grecian train 
 stern in superior grief pelides stood 
 those slaughtering arms , so used to bathe in blood 
 now clasp his clay cold limbs : then gushing start 
 the tears , and sighs burst from his swelling heart 
 the lion thus , with dreadful anguish stung 
 roars through the desert , and demands his young 
 when the grim savage , to his rifled den 
 too late returning , snuffs the track of men 
 and o ’ er the vales and o ’ er the forest bounds 
 his clamorous grief the bellowing wood resounds 
 so grieves achilles ; and , impetuous , vents 
 to all his myrmidons his loud laments 

did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye 
 ‘ gainst whom the world could not hold argument 
 persuade my heart to this false perjury 
 vows for thee broke deserve not punishment 
 a woman i forswore ; but i will prove 
 thou being a goddess , i forswore not thee 
 my vow was earthly , thou a heavenly love 
 thy grace being gain 'd cures all disgrace in me 
 my vow was breath , and breath a vapour is 
 then , thou fair sun , that on this earth doth shine 
 exhale this vapour vow ; in thee it is 
 if broken , then it is no fault of mine 
 if by me broke , what fool is not so wise 
 to break an oath , to win a paradise 

father , part of his double interest 
 unto thy kingdom thy son gives to me 
 his jointure in the knotty trinity 
 he keeps , and gives to me his death 's conquest 
 this lamb , whose death with life the world hath blest 
 was from the world 's beginning slain , and he 
 hath made two wills , which , with the legacy 
 of his and thy kingdom , thy sons invest 
 yet such are these laws , that men argue yet 
 whether a man those statutes can fulfil 
 none doth ; but thy all healing grace and spirit 
 revive again what law and letter kill 
 thy law 's abridgment and thy last command 
 is all but love ; oh , let this last will stand 

said he , we now are in a place retired 
 unknown to man , ( such spots how oft desired 
 let 's take advantage of the present hour 
 no joys , but those of love , are in our pow'r 
 all others see withdrawn ! and no one knows 
 we even live ; perhaps both friends and foes 
 believe us in the belly of a whale 
 allow me , lovely princess , to prevail 
 bestow your kindness , or , without delay 
 those charms to mamolin let me convey 
 yet , why go thither ?— happy you could make 
 the man , whose constancy no perils shake 
 what would you more ?— his passion 's ardent grown 
 and surely you 've enough resistance shown 

was this his coming ! i had hoped to see 
 a scene of wondrous glory , as was told 
 of some great god who in a rain of gold 
 broke open bars and fell on danae 
 or a dread vision as when semele 
 sickening for love and unappeased desire 
 prayed to see god 's clear body , and the fire 
 caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly 
 with such glad dreams i sought this holy place 
 and now with wondering eyes and heart i stand 
 before this supreme mystery of love 
 some kneeling girl with passionless pale face 
 an angel with a lily in his hand 
 and over both the white wings of a dove 

there is no picturesqueness and no glory 
 no halo of romance , in war to day 
 it is a hideous thing ; time would turn grey 
 with horror , were he not already hoary 
 at sight of this vile monster , foul and gory 
 yet while sweet women perish as they pray 
 and new born babes are slaughtered , who dare say 
 ‘ halt ! ’ till right pens its ‘ finis ’ to the story 
 there is no pathway , but the path through blood 
 out of the horrors of this holocaust 
 hell has let loose its scalding crimson flood 
 and he who stops to argue now is lost 
 not brooms of creeds , not pacifistic words 
 can stem the tide , but swords — uplifted swords 

never the heart of spring had trembled so 
 as on that day when first in paradise 
 we went afoot as novices to know 
 for the first time what blue was in the skies 
 what fresher green than any in the grass 
 and how the sap goes beating to the sun 
 and tell how on the clocks of beauty pass 
 minute by minute till the last is done 
 but not the new birds singing in the brake 
 and not the buds of our discovery 
 the deeper blue , the wilder green , the ache 
 for beauty that we shadow as we see 
 made heaven , but we , as love 's occasion brings 
 took these , and made them paradisal things 

and beatrice : “ the first diving soul 
 that ever the first virtue fram 'd , admires 
 within these rays his maker . ” like the leaf 
 that bows its lithe top till the blast is blown 
 by its own virtue rear 'd then stands aloof 
 so i , the whilst she said , awe stricken bow 'd 
 then eagerness to speak embolden 'd me 
 and i began : “ o fruit ! that wast alone 
 mature , when first engender 'd ! ancient father 
 that doubly seest in every wedded bride 
 thy daughter by affinity and blood 
 devoutly as i may , i pray thee hold 
 converse with me : my will thou seest ; and i 
 more speedily to hear thee , tell it not 

when i consider how my light is spent 
 ere half my days in this dark world and wide 
 and that one talent which is death to hide 
 lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent 
 to serve therewith my maker , and present 
 my true account , lest he , returning , chide 
 ‘ doth god exact day labour , light denied 
 i fondly ask : but patience , to prevent 
 that murmur soon replies : ‘ god doth not need 
 either man 's work or his own gifts . who best 
 bear his mild yoke , they serve him best . his state 
 is kingly : thousands at his bidding speed 
 and post o'er land and ocean without rest 
 they also serve who only stand and wait 

“ dear mother ida , hearken ere i die 
 they came , they cut away my tallest pines 
 my dark tall pines , that plumed the craggy ledge 
 high over the blue gorge , or lower down 
 filling greengulph è d ida , all between 
 the snowy peak and snowwhite cataract 
 fostered the callow eaglet — from beneath 
 whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark 
 the panther 's roar came muffled , while i sat 
 low in the valley . never , nevermore 
 shall lone  none see the morning mist 
 sweep thro ’ them — never see them overlaid 
 with narrow moon lit slips of silver cloud 
 between the loud stream and the trembling stars 

still earnest with my theme , i bade him think 
 of auerbach 's cellar , and that wassail night 
 whole centuries ago : and then in phrase 
 better than that which cometh to me now 
 i likened it — the necromancy which 
 drew richest vintage from the rugged boards 
 unto the spell wherewith he 'd bound himself 
 the spell by which he drew from simplest things 
 conceptions beautiful , as faust drew wine 
 from the rude table ; for this friend of mine 
 was a true poet , though he seldom wrote 
 the wealth which might have royally endowed 
 some noble charity for coming time 
 was idly wasted — pearls dissolved in wine 

dear heart and love ! what happiness to sit 
 and watch the firelight 's varying shade and shine 
 on thy young face ; and through those eyes of thine 
 as through glad windows — mark fair fancies flit 
 in sumptuous chambers of thy soul 's chaste wit 
 like graceful women : then to take in mine 
 thy hand , whose pressure brims my heart 's divine 
 hushed rapture as with music exquisite 
 when i remember how thy look and touch 
 sway , like the moon , my blood with ecstasy 
 i dare not think to what fierce heaven might lead 
 thy soft embrace ; or in thy kiss how much 
 sweet hell ,— beyond all help of me ,— might be 
 where i were lost , where i were lost indeed 

i ask but one thing of you , only one 
 that always you will be my dream of you 
 that never shall i wake to find untrue 
 all this i have believed and rested on 
 forever vanished , like a vision gone 
 out into the night . alas , how few 
 there are who strike in us a chord we knew 
 existed , but so seldom heard its tone 
 we tremble at the half forgotten sound 
 the world is full of rude awakenings 
 and heaven born castles shattered to the ground 
 yet still our human longing vainly clings 
 to a belief in beauty through all wrongs 
 o stay your hand , and leave my heart its songs 

unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend 
 upon thy self thy beauty 's legacy 
 nature 's bequest gives nothing but doth lend 
 and being frank she lends to those are free 
 then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse 
 the bounteous largess given thee to give 
 profitless usurer why dost thou use 
 so great a sum of sums yet canst not live 
 for having traffic with thy self alone 
 thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive 
 then how when nature calls thee to be gone 
 what acceptable audit canst thou leave 
 thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee 
 which used lives th ’ executor to be 

and weep not , though the beautiful decay 
 within thy heart , as daily in thine eyes 
 thy heart must have its autumn , its pale skies 
 leading , mayhap , to winter 's dim dismay 
 yet doubt not . beauty doth not pass away 
 her form departs not , though her body dies 
 secure beneath the earth the snowdrop lies 
 waiting the spring 's young resurrection day 
 through the kind nurture of the winter cold 
 nor seek thou by vain effort to revive 
 the summer time , when roses were alive 
 do thou thy work — be willing to be old 
 thy sorrow is the husk that doth infold 
 a gorgeous june , for which thou need'st not strive 

“ the angels , o my brother ! and this clime

on went the pair , until they reached the bound 
 where the great linden stood , set deep in snow 
 up to the lower branches . “ here we stop 
 said eva , “ for my mother has my word 
 that i will go no further than this tree 
 then the snow maiden laughed : “ and what is this 
 this fear of the pure snow , the innocent snow 
 that never harmed aught living ? thou mayst roam 
 for leagues beyond this garden , and return 
 in safety ; here the grim wolf never prowls 
 and here the eagle of our mountain crags

in former days , just by cythera town 
 a monastery was , of some renown 
 with nuns the queens of beauty filled the place 
 and gay gallants you easily might trace 
 the courtier , citizen , and parson too 
 the doctor and the bachelor you 'd view 
 with eager steps :— all visits thither made 
 and ‘ mong the latter , one ( a pleasing blade 
 had free access : was thought a prudent friend 
 who might to sisters many comforts lend

 and ev'ry thing he said was well expressed 
 the breath of scandal , howsoever pat

now other hands take up that mother 's task 
 another breast nurses that sweet young child 
 with growing love ; for who can nurse a child 
 feel its warm breath , and little dimpled hands 
 kiss its soft lips , look in its laughing eyes 
 hear its low cooing love notes soft and sweet 
 and not feel something of that miracle 
 a mother 's love — so old yet ever new 
 stronger than death , bravest among the brave 
 gentle as brave , watchful both night and day 
 that never changes , never tires nor sleeps 
 whence comes this wondrous and undying love 
 whence can it come , unless it comes from heaven 
 whose life is love — eternal , perfect love 

come , come to bed . the shadows move about 
 and some one seems to overhear our talk 
 the fire is low ; the candles flicker out 
 the ghosts of former tenants want to walk 
 already they are shuffling through the gloom 
 i felt an old man touch my shoulder blade 
 once he was married here ; they love this room 
 he and his woman and the child they made 
 dead , dead , they are , yet some familiar sound 
 creeping along the brink of happy life 
 revives their memory from under ground 
 the farmer and his troublesome old wife 
 let us be going : as we climb the stairs 
 they 'll sit down in our warm half empty chairs 

when o'er the cultured lawns and dreary wastes 
 200 retiring autumn flings her howling blasts 
 bends in tumultuous waves the struggling woods 
 and showers their leafy honours on the floods 
 in withering heaps collects the flowery spoil 
 and each chill insect sinks beneath the soil 
 205 quick flies fair tulipa the loud alarms 
 and folds her infant closer in her arms 
 in some lone cave , secure pavilion , lies 
 and waits the courtship of serener skies 
 so , six cold moons , the dormouse charm 'd to rest 
 210 indulgent sleep ! beneath thy eider breast 
 in fields of fancy climbs the kernel 'd groves 
 or shares the golden harvest with his loves 

whoever hath her wish , thou hast thy will 
 and ‘ will ’ to boot , and ‘ will ’ in over plus 
 more than enough am i that vex thee still 
 to thy sweet will making addition thus 
 wilt thou whose will is large and spacious 
 not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine 
 shall will in others seem right gracious 
 and in my will no fair acceptance shine 
 the sea all water , yet receives rain still 
 and in abundance addeth to his store 
 so thou being rich in will add to thy will 
 one will of mine to make thy large will more

venemous tongue , tipt with vile adders sting 
 of that self kynd with which the furies fell 
 their snaky heads doe combe , from which a spring 
 of poysoned words and spightfull speeches well 
 let all the plagues and horrid paines of hell 
 upon thee fall for thine accursed hyre 
 that with false forged lyes , which thou didst tell 
 in my true love did stirre up coles of yre 
 the sparkes whereof let kindle thine own fyre 
 and , catching hold on thine own wicked bed 
 consume thee quite , that didst with guile conspire 
 in my sweet peace such breaches to have bred 
 shame be thy meed , and mischiefe thy reward 
 due to thy selfe , that it for me prepard 

when love puffed up with rage of high disdain 
 resolved to make me pattern of his might 
 like foe , whose wits inclined to deadly spite 
 would often kill , to breed more feeling pain 
 he would not , armed with beauty , only reign 
 on those affects which easily yield to sight 
 but virtue sets so high , that reason 's light 
 for all his strife can only bondage gain 
 so that i live to pay a mortal fee 
 dead palsy sick of all my chiefest parts 
 like those whom dreams make ugly monsters see 
 and can cry help with naught but groans and starts 
 longing to have , having no wit to wish 
 to starving minds such is god cupid 's dish 

the day approaches , when a mystic power 
 shall summon mute antiquity , to tell 
 the buried glories of the long lost hour 
 and she will answer the enchanter 's spell 
 then shall we hear what wondrous things befell 
 when the young world existed in its prime 
 the truths revealed will turn the wisest pale 
 that ignorance so long abused their time 
 vainly may error blessed truth assail 
 with specious argument , and looking wise 
 exult , as millions worship at her shrine 
 yet , in the time ordained , shall truth arise 
 and walk in beauty over earth and skies 
 while man in reverence bows before her power divine 

he strode along the field , as thus he said 
 ( the sable plumage nodded o ’ er his head 
 swift through the spacious plain he sent a look 
 one instant saw , one instant overtook 
 the distant band , that on the sandy shore 
 the radiant spoils to sacred ilion bore 
 there his own mail unbraced the field bestrow ’ d 
 his train to troy convey ’ d the massy load 
 now blazing in the immortal arms he stands 
 the work and present of celestial hands 
 by aged peleus to achilles given 
 as first to peleus by the court of heaven 
 his father ’ s arms not long achilles wears 
 forbid by fate to reach his father ’ s years 

hadst thou been one of these , in many eyes 
 too near to be a glory for thy sheen 
 thou hadst been scorned ; and to the best hadst been 
 a setter forth of strange divinities 
 but to the few construct of harmonies 
 a sudden sun , uplighting the serene 
 high heaven of love ; and , through the cloudy screen 
 that ‘ twixt our souls and truth all wretched lies 
 dawning at length , hadst been a love and fear 
 worshipped on high from magian 's mountain crest 
 and all night long symbolled by lamp flames clear 
 thy sign , a star upon thy people 's breast 
 where that strange arbitrary token lies 
 which once did scare the sun in noontide skies 

as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow'st 
 in one of thine , from that which thou departest 
 and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st 
 thou mayst call thine , when thou from youth convertest 
 herein lives wisdom , beauty , and increase 
 without this folly , age , and cold decay 
 if all were minded so , the times should cease 
 and threescore year would make the world away 
 let those whom nature hath not made for store 
 harsh , featureless , and rude , barrenly perish 
 look whom she best endowed , she gave thee more 
 which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish 
 she carved thee for her seal , and meant thereby 
 thou shouldst print more , not let that copy die 

check every outflash , every ruder sally 
 of thought and speech ; speak low , and give up wholly 
 thy spirit to mild minded melancholy 
 this is the place . through yonder poplar alley 
 below , the blue green river windeth slowly 
 but in the middle of the sombre valley 
 the crisp è d waters whisper musically 
 and all the haunted place is dark and holy 
 the nightingale , with long and low preamble 
 warbled from yonder knoll of solemn larches 
 and in and out the woodbine 's flowery arches 
 the summer midges wove their wanton gambol 
 and all the white stemmed pinewood slept above 
 when in this valley first i told my love 

a peevish husband makes a peevish wife 
 and so brings scandal on a married life 
 no wonder then if sickness and disease 
 brought on by crosses , doth the body seize 
 all this is owing to a hair brain 'd man 
 whose base ill nature all the strife began 
 then why shou 'd women thus be stil 'd a curse 
 when man himself perhaps is ten times worse 
 perhaps you 'll say this is proposterous 
 in blaming others i my self expose 
 i answer thus , if it was not for shame 
 i 'd this same minute quite disown the name 
 for men like you , their names do sound no more 
 than if you call 'd an honest woman whore 

and , with rich clusters laden , there was grav'n 
 a vineyard fair , all gold ; of glossy black 
 the bunches were , on silver poles sustain 'd 
 around , a darksome trench ; beyond , a fence 
 was wrought , of shining tin ; and through it led 
 one only path , by which the bearers pass 'd 
 who gather 'd in the vineyard 's bounteous store 
 there maids and youths , in joyous spirits bright 
 in woven baskets bore the luscious fruit 
 a boy , amid them , from a clear ton 'd harp 
 drew lovely music ; well his liquid voice 
 the strings accompanied ; they all with dance 
 and song harmonious join 'd , and joyous shouts 
 as the gay bevy lightly tripp 'd along 

thou splendid girl that seemest the mother of all 
 dear ceres aphrodite , with every lure 
 that draws the bee to honey , with the call 
 of moth winged night to sinners , yet as pure 
 as the white nun that counts the stars for beads 
 thou blest madonna of all broken needs 
 thou melusine , thou sister of sorrowing man 
 thou wave like laughter , thou dear sob in the throat 
 thou all enfolding mercy , and thou song 
 that gathers up each wild and wandering note 
 and takes and breaks and heals and breaks the heart 
 with the omnipotent tenderness of art 
 and thou intelligence of rose leaves made 
 that makes that little thing the brain afraid 

he held no dream worth waking : so he said 
 he who stands now on death 's triumphal steep 
 awakened out of life wherein we sleep 
 and dream of what he knows and sees , being dead 
 but never death for him was dark or dread 
 “ look forth ” he bade the soul , and fear not . weep 
 all ye that trust not in his truth , and keep 
 vain memory 's vision of a vanished head 
 as all that lives of all that once was he 
 save that which lightens from his word : but we 
 who , seeing the sunset coloured waters roll 
 yet know the sun subdued not of the sea 
 nor weep nor doubt that still the spirit is whole 
 and life and death but shadows of the soul 

and speaking thus , he leapt on black lewin 
 and smote him twice full hard upon the chin 
 two goodly blows upon that big , black jowl 
 whereat black lewin lustily did howl 
 and falling back , his polished bascinet 
 with ringing clash the cold , hard flagstones met 
 whereat his fellows , shouting fierce alarms 
 incontinent betook them to their arms 
 and thus it seemed a fight there must have been 
 but that a horseman sudden spurred between 
 a blue eyed youth with yellow , curling hair 
 of slender shape , of face and feature fair 
 a dainty knight was he in very truth 
 a blue eyed , merry , laughter loving youth 

unto the boundless ocean of thy beauty 
 runs this poor river , charged with streams of zeal 
 returning thee the tribute of my duty 
 which here my love , my youth , my plaints reveal 
 here i unclasp the book of my charged soul 
 where i have cast th ’ accounts of all my care 
 here have i summed my sighs . here i enrol 
 how they were spent for thee . look , what they are 
 look on the dear expenses of my youth 
 and see how just i reckon with thine eyes 
 examine well thy beauty with my truth 
 and cross my cares ere greater sums arise 
 read it , sweet maid , though it be done but slightly 
 who can show all his love , doth love but lightly 

inland , within a hollow vale , i stood 
 and saw , while sea was calm and air was clear 
 the coast of france — the coast of france how near 
 drawn almost into frightful neighbourhood 
 i shrunk ; for verily the barrier flood 
 was like a lake , or river bright and fair 
 a span of waters ; yet what power is there 
 what mightiness for evil and for good ! [ b 
 even so doth god protect us if we be 
 virtuous and wise . winds blow , and waters roll 
 strength to the brave , and power , and deity 
 yet in themselves are nothing ! one decree 
 spake laws to them , and said that by the soul 
 only , the nations shall be great and free 

so spoke the god who darts celestial fires 
 he dreads his fury , and some steps retires 
 then phoebus bore the chief of venus ’ race 
 to troy ’ s high fane , and to his holy place 
 latona there and phoebe heal ’ d the wound 
 with vigour arm ’ d him , and with glory crown ’ d 
 this done , the patron of the silver bow 
 a phantom raised , the same in shape and show 
 with great æ neas ; such the form he bore 
 and such in fight the radiant arms he wore 
 around the spectre bloody wars are waged 
 and greece and troy with clashing shields engaged 
 meantime on ilion ’ s tower apollo stood 
 and calling mars , thus urged the raging god 

the star of my mishap imposed this pain 
 to spend the april of my years in grief 
 finding my fortune ever in the wane 
 with still fresh cares , supplied with no relief 
 yet thee i blame not , though for thee ‘ tis done 
 but these weak wings presuming to aspire 
 which now are melted by thine eyes ’ bright sun 
 that makes me fall from off my high desire 
 and in my fall i cry for help with speed 
 no pitying eye looks back upon my fears 
 no succour find i now when most i need 
 my heats must drown in th'ocean of my tears 
 which still must bear the title of my wrong 
 caused by those cruel beams that were so strong 

but first the monarch , so polite 
 asked mr. whitbread if he 'd be a knight 
 unwilling in the list to be enrolled 
 whitbread contemplated the knights of peg 
 then to his generous sovereign made a leg 
 and said , “ he was afraid he was too old 
 he thanked however his most gracious king 
 for offering to make him such a thing 
 but , ah ! a different reason ‘ twas i fear 
 it was not age that bade the man of beer 
 the proffered honor of the monarch shun 
 the tale of margaret 's knife , and royal fright 
 had almost made him damn the name of knight 
 a tale that farrowed such a world of fun 

now powerful but inconstant in its course 
 the tempest varies with uncertain force 
 like doleful wailings on the lonely waste 
 solemn and dreary sounds the weaning blast 
 exhausted gusts recoiling growl away 
 and , wak 'd anew , return with feebler sway 
 save where between the ridgy mountains pent 
 the fierce imprison 'd current strives for vent 
 with hollow howl , and lamentation deep 
 then rushes o'er the plain with partial sweep 
 a parting gust o'erscours the weary land 
 and lowly growls along the distant strand 
 light thro ’ the wood the shiv'ring branches play 
 and on the ocean far it slowly dies away 

o friend ! may each domestic bliss be thine 
 be no unpleasing melancholy mine 
 me , let the tender office long engage 
 to rock the cradle of reposing age 
 with lenient arts extend a mother 's breath 
 make languor smile , and smooth the bed of death 
 explore the thought , explain the asking eye 
 and keep a while one parent from the sky 
 on cares like these if length of days attend 
 may heav'n , to bless those days , preserve my friend 
 preserve him social , cheerful , and serene 
 and just as rich as when he serv 'd a queen 
 a . whether that blessing be deny 'd or giv'n 
 thus far was right , the rest belongs to heav'n 

disciple of the bright aonian maid 
 in thy life 's blossom , a resistless spell 
 amid the wild wood , and irriguous dell 
 o'er thymy hill , and thro ’ illumin 'd glade 
 led thee , for her thy votive wreaths to braid 
 where flaunts the musk rose , and the azure bell 
 nods o'er loquacious brook , or silent well 
 thus woo 'd her inspirations , their rapt aid 
 liberal she gave ; nor only thro ’ thy strain 
 breath 'd their pure spirit , while her charms beguil 'd 
 the languid hours of sorrow , and of pain 
 but when youth 's tide ran high , and tempting smil 'd 
 circean pleasure , rescuing did she stand 
 broke the enchantress ’ cup and snapt her wand 

so oft as homeward i from her depart 
 i go lyke one that , having lost the field 
 is prisoner led away with heavy hart 
 despoyld of warlike armes and knowen shield 
 so doe i now my self a prisoner yield 
 to sorrow and to solitary paine 
 from presence of my dearest deare exylde 
 long while alone in languor to remaine 
 there let no thought of ioy , or pleasure vaine 
 dare to approch , that may my solace breed 
 bet sudden * dumps **, and drery sad disdayne 
 of all worlds gladnesse , more my torment feed 
 so i her absens will my penaunce make

a dimness of a glory glimmers here 
 thro ’ veils and distance from the space remote 
 a faintest far vibration of a note 
 reaches to us and seems to bring us near 
 causing our face to glow with braver cheer 
 making the serried mist to stand afloat 
 subduing languor with an antidote 
 and strengthening love almost to cast out fear 
 till for one moment golden city walls 
 rise looming on us , golden walls of home 
 light of our eyes until the darkness falls 
 then thro ’ the outer darkness burdensome 
 i hear again the tender voice that calls 
 “ follow me hither , follow , rise , and come 

others have urg 'd ( but weigh it , and you 'll find 
 ‘ tis light as feathers blown before the wind 
 that poverty , the curse of providence 
 attones for a dull writer 's want of sense 
 alas ! his dulness ‘ twas that made him poor 
 not vice versa : we infer no more 
 of vice and folly poverty 's the curse

 by good made bad , by favours more disgrac 'd 
 so dire th ’ effects of ignorance misplac 'd 
 of idle youth , unwatch 'd by parents eyes

lady ! where'er you roam , whatever land 
 woos the bright touches of that artist hand 
 whether you sketch the valley 's golden meads 
 where mazy linth his lingering current leads 
 enamored catch the mellow hues that sleep 
 at eve , on meillerie 's immortal steep 
 or musing o'er the lake , at day 's decline 
 mark the last shadow on that holy shrine 
 where , many a night , the shade of tell complains 
 of gallia 's triumph and helvetia 's chains 
 oh ! lay the pencil for a moment by 
 turn from the canvas that creative eye 
 and let its splendor , like the morning ray 
 upon a shepherd 's harp , illume my lay 

in vain he sigh 'd , and oft with tears desired 
 some reasonable suit might be required 
 but still the crone was constant to her note 
 the more he spoke , the more she stretch 'd her throat 
 in vain he proffer 'd all his goods , to save 
 his body destined to that living grave 
 the liquorish hag rejects the pelf with scorn 
 and nothing but the man would serve her turn 
 not all the wealth of eastern kings , said she 
 have power to part my plighted love , and me 
 and , old and ugly as i am , and poor 
 yet never will i break the faith i swore 
 for mine thou art by promise , during life 
 and i thy loving and obedient wife 

i think if you had loved me when i wanted 
 if i 'd looked up one day , and seen your eyes 
 and found my wild sick blasphemous prayer granted 
 and your brown face , that 's full of pity and wise 
 flushed suddenly ; the white godhead in new fear 
 intolerably so struggling , and so shamed 
 most holy and far , if you 'd come all too near 
 if earth had seen earth 's lordliest wild limbs tamed 
 shaken , and trapped , and shivering , for my touch 
 myself should i have slain ? or that foul you 
 but this the strange gods , who had given so much 
 to have seen and known you , this they might not do 
 one last shame 's spared me , one black word 's unspoken 
 and i 'm alone ; and you have not awoken 

‘ to all and singular , ’ as dryden says 
 we bring a fancy of those georgian days 
 whose style still breathed a faint and fine perfume 
 of old world courtliness and old world bloom 
 when speech was elegant and talk was fit 
 for slang had not been canonised as wit 
 when manners reigned , when breeding had the wall 
 and women — yes !— were ladies first of all 
 when grace was conscious of its gracefulness 
 and man — though man !— was not ashamed to dress 
 a brave formality , a measured ease 
 were his — and hers — whose effort was to please 
 and to excel in pleasing was to reign 
 and , if you sighed , never to sigh in vain 

who lists to see what ever nature , arte 
 and heaven could doo , o rome , thee let him see 
 in case thy greatnes he can gesse in harte 
 by that which but the picture is of thee 
 rome is no more : but if the shade of rome 
 may of the bodie yeeld a seeming sight 
 it 's like a corse drawne forth out of the tombe 
 by magicke skill out of eternall night 
 the corpes of rome in ashes is entombed 
 and her great spirite , reioyned to the spirite 
 of this great masse , is in the same enwombed 
 but her brave writings , which , her famous merite 
 in spight of time out of the dust doth reare 
 doo make her idole * through the world appeare 

now thrice that morning guinevere had climbed 
 the giant tower , from whose high crest , they say 
 men saw the goodly hills of somerset 
 and white sails flying on the yellow sea 
 but not to goodly hill or yellow sea 
 looked the fair queen , but up the vale of usk 
 by the flat meadow , till she saw them come 
 and then descending met them at the gates 
 embraced her with all welcome as a friend 
 and did her honour as the prince 's bride 
 and clothed her for her bridals like the sun 
 and all that week was old caerleon gay 
 for by the hands of dubric , the high saint 
 they twain were wedded with all ceremony 

i would i were that portly gentleman 
 with gold laced hat and golden headed cane 
 who hangs in delia 's parlor ! for whene'er 
 from book or needlework her looks arise 
 on him converge the sun beams of her eyes 
 and he unblamed may gaze upon my fair 
 and oft my fair his favored form surveys 
 o happy picture ! still on her to gaze 
 i envy him ! and jealous fear alarms 
 lest the strong glance of those divinest charms 
 warm him to life , as in the ancient days 
 when marble melted in pygmalion 's arms 
 i would i were that portly gentleman 
 with gold laced hat and golden headed cane 

nor , in the trojan camp , did hector leave 
 the chiefs to rest ; but all to conf'rence call 'd 
 the leaders and the councillors of troy 
 to whom his prudent speech he thus address 'd 
 “ who is there here , that for a rich reward 
 a noble work will undertake ? a car 
 and two strong collar 'd horses , best of all 
 that can be found within the grecian lines 
 shall he receive , who , to his endless praise 
 shall dare approach the ships ; and learn if still 
 they keep their wonted watch , or , by our arms 
 subdued and vanquished , meditate retreat 
 and , worn with toil , the nightly watch neglect 
 thus hector spoke ; but all in silence heard 

then down her bow the winged iris drives 
 and swift at priam ’ s mournful court arrives 
 where the sad sons beside their father ’ s throne 
 sat bathed in tears , and answer ’ d groan with groan 
 and all amidst them lay the hoary sire 
 ( sad scene of woe !) his face his wrapp ’ d attire 
 conceal ’ d from sight ; with frantic hands he spread 
 a shower of ashes o ’ er his neck and head 
 from room to room his pensive daughters roam 
 whose shrieks and clamours fill the vaulted dome 
 mindful of those , who late their pride and joy 
 lie pale and breathless round the fields of troy 
 before the king jove ’ s messenger appears 
 and thus in whispers greets his trembling ears 

is it thy will , thy image should keep open 
 my heavy eyelids to the weary night 
 dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken 
 while shadows like to thee do mock my sight 
 is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee 
 so far from home into my deeds to pry 
 to find out shames and idle hours in me 
 the scope and tenure of thy jealousy 
 o no , thy love though much , is not so great 
 it is my love that keeps mine eye awake 
 mine own true love that doth my rest defeat 
 to play the watchman ever for thy sake 
 for thee watch i , whilst thou dost wake elsewhere 
 from me far off , with others all too near 

aloof within the day 's enormous dome 
 he holds unshared the silence of the sky 
 far down his bleak , relentless eyes descry 
 the eagle 's empire and the falcon 's home 
 far down , the galleons of sunset roam 
 his hazards on the sea of morning lie 
 serene , he hears the broken tempest sigh 
 where cold sierras gleam like scattered foam 
 and least of all he holds the human swarm 
 unwitting now that envious men prepare 
 to make their dream and its fulfillment one 
 when , poised above the caldrons of the storm 
 their hearts , contemptuous of death , shall dare 
 his roads between the thunder and the sun 

heaven bless the new year that is just ushered in 
 may the rebels repent of their folly and sin 
 depart from their idols , extend the right hand 
 and pledge that the union forever shall stand 
 may they see that the rending of fetter and chain 
 is their triumph as well — their unspeakable gain 
 that the union dissevered and weltering in blood 
 could yield them no profit and bode them no good 
 ‘ tis human to err and divine to forgive 
 let us walk after christ — bid the poor sinners live 
 and come back to the fold of the union once more 
 and we 'll do as the prodigal 's father of yore 
 kill the well fatted calf — ( but we 'll not do it twice 
 and invite them to dinner — and give them a slice 

god hides in nature as a thought doth hide 
 in humbly sounding words ; and as the thought 
 beats through the lowly word like pulse of heart 
 that giveth life and keepeth life alive 
 so god , thro ’ nature , works on ev'ry soul 
 for nature is his word so strangely writ 
 in heav'n , in all the letters of the stars 
 beneath the stars in alphabets of clouds 
 and on the seas in syllables of waves 
 and in the earth , on all the leaves of flowers 
 and on the grasses and the stately trees 
 and on the rivers and the mournful rocks 
 the word is clearly written ; blest are they 
 who read the word aright — and understand 

for had she not been fair and thus unkind 
 then had no finger pointed at my lightness 
 the world had never known what i do find 
 and clouds obscure had shaded still her brightness 
 then had no censor 's eye these lines surveyed 
 nor graver brows have judged my muse so vain 
 no sun my blush and error had bewrayed 
 nor yet the world had heard of such disdain 
 then had i walked with bold erected face 
 no downcast look had signified my miss 
 but my degraded hopes with such disgrace 
 did force me groan out griefs and utter this 
 for being full , should i not then have spoken 
 my sense oppressed had failed and heart had broken 

thus england groan 'd , britannia 's voice was heard 
 and great nassau to rescue her appear 'd 
 call 'd by the universal voice of fate 
 god and the people 's legal magistrate 
 ye heavens regard ! almighty jove look down 
 and view thy injured monarch on the throne 
 on their ungrateful heads due vengeance take 
 who sought his aid , and then his part forsake 
 witness , ye powers ! it was our call alone 
 which now our pride makes us ashamed to own 
 britannia 's troubles fetch 'd him from afar 
 to court the dreadful casualties of war 
 but where requital never can be made 
 acknowledgment 's a tribute seldom paid 

what though , for showing truth to flatter 'd state 
 kind hunt was shut in prison , yet has he 
 in his immortal spirit , been as free 
 as the sky searching lark , and as elate 
 minion of grandeur ! think you he did wait 
 think you he nought but prison walls did see 
 till , so unwilling , thou unturn'dst the key 
 ah , no ! far happier , nobler was his fate 
 in spenser 's halls he strayed , and bowers fair 
 culling enchanted flowers ; and he flew 
 with daring milton through the fields of air 
 to regions of his own his genius true 
 took happy flights . who shall his fame impair 
 when thou art dead , and all thy wretched crew 

to one who has been long in city pent 
 ‘ tis very sweet to look into the fair 
 and open face of heaven ,— to breathe a prayer 
 full in the smile of the blue firmament 
 who is more happy , when , with heart 's content 
 fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair 
 of wavy grass , and reads a debonair 
 and gentle tale of love and languishment 
 returning home at evening , with an ear 
 catching the notes of philomel ,— and eye 
 watching the sailing cloudlet 's bright career 
 he mourns that day so soon has glided by 
 e'en like the passage of an angel 's tear 
 that falls through the clear ether silently

 the family pride of a spaniard from arragon

‘ neath myriad mellow tapers ’ golden glow 
 a woman stands , proud , insolent and fair 
 a single gem meshed in the dusk dyed hair 
 burns like the evening star descending low 
 adown the dark'ning sky . upon the snow 
 of her full blossomed breast deep rubies lie 
 her fragrant presence breathes sweet sorcery 
 the shimmering saffron satin 's flexile flow 
 outlines each sinuous curve ; a sensuous smile 
 a touch that fires to flame each pulsant vein 
 one draught of eyes more deep than depths of wine 
 the senses steal , the soul and brain beguile 
 till all seem merged in feeling ... and again 
 a circe 's spells transform men into swine 

i go from colonnade to colonnade 
 in streets that dante trod , and past the towers 
 aslant toward heaven , and listen to the hours 
 chimed by the bells of choirs where dante prayed 
 they cease ; then lo ! the foot of time seems stayed 
 five hundred years and more , i find me bowers 
 where sweet and noble ladies weave them flowers 
 for one who reads boccaccio in the shade 
 the cowl è d students halt by two and threes 
 to hear the voice come thrilling through the trees 
 then tear themselves away to themes more trite 
 anon i mark the diligent hands that turn 
 unlovely parchment scrolls whereby to learn 
 the beauty of inexorable right 

i know not why , but all this weary day 
 suggested by no definite grief or pain 
 sad fancies have been flitting through my brain 
 now it has been a vessel losing way 
 rounding a stormy headland ; now a gray 
 dull waste of clouds above a wintry main 
 and then , a banner , drooping in the rain 
 and meadows beaten into bloody clay 
 strolling at random with this shadowy woe 
 at heart , i chanced to wander hither ! lo 
 a league of desolate marsh land , with its lush 
 hot grasses in a noisome , tide left bed 
 and faint , warm airs , that rustle in the hush 
 like whispers round the body of the dead 

the fowler hides as closely as he may 
 the net , where caught the silly bird should be 
 lest he the threatening poison should but see 
 and so for fear be forced to fly away 
 my lady so , the while she doth assay 
 in curl è d knots fast to entangle me 
 put on her veil , to th ’ end i should not flee 
 the golden net wherein i am a prey 
 alas , most sweet ! what need is of a net 
 to catch a bird that is already ta'en 
 sith with your hand alone you may it get 
 for it desires to fly into the same 
 what needs such art my thoughts then to entrap 
 when of themselves they fly into your lap 

thou who didst waken from his summer dreams 
 the blue mediterranean , where he lay 
 lull 'd by the coil of his crystalline streams 
 beside a pumice isle in baiae 's bay 
 and saw in sleep old palaces and towers 
 quivering within the wave 's intenser day 
 all overgrown with azure moss and flowers 
 so sweet , the sense faints picturing them ! thou 
 for whose path the atlantic 's level powers 
 cleave themselves into chasms , while far below 
 the sea blooms and the oozy woods which wear 
 the sapless foliage of the ocean , know 
 thy voice , and suddenly grow gray with fear 
 and tremble and despoil themselves : o hear 

next morning , as an anxious village group 
 stood meditating plans what best to do 
 came little trudchen , who , in simple tones 
 said , “ father 's at the forge — i heard him there 
 working long hours ago ; but he is angry 
 i raised the latch : he bade me to be gone 
 what have i done to make him chide me so 
 and then her bright blue eyes ran o'er with tears 
 “ the child 's been dreaming through this troubled night 
 said a kind dame , and drew the child towards her 
 but the sad answers of the girl were such 
 as led them all to seek her father 's forge 
 ( it lay beyond the village some short span 
 they forced the door , and there beheld the smith 

“ ‘ close by , a rock of less enormous height 
 breaks the wild waves , and forms a dangerous strait 
 full on its crown a fig 's green branches rise 
 and shoot a leafy forest to the skies 
 beneath , charybdis holds her boisterous reign 
 ‘ midst roaring whirlpools , and absorbs the main 
 thrice in her gulfs the boiling seas subside 
 thrice in dire thunders she refunds the tide 
 oh , if thy vessel plough the direful waves 
 when seas retreating roar within her caves 
 ye perish all ! though he who rules the main 
 lends his strong aid , his aid he lends in vain 
 ah , shun the horrid gulf ! by scylla fly 
 ‘ tis better six to lose , than all to die 

all night i wrestled with a memory 
 which knocked insurgent at the gates of thought 
 the crumbled wreck of years behind has wrought 
 its disillusion ; now i only cry 
 for peace , for power to forget the lie 
 which hope too long has whispered . so i sought 
 the sleep which would not come , and night was fraught 
 with old emotions weeping silently 
 i heard your voice again , and knew the things 
 which you had promised proved an empty vaunt 
 i felt your clinging hands while night 's broad wings 
 cherished our love in darkness . from the lawn 
 a sudden , quivering birdnote , like a taunt 
 my arms held nothing but the empty dawn 

is it not strange ? a year ago to day 
 with scarce a thought beyond the hum drum round 
 i did my decent job and earned my pay 
 was averagely happy , i 'll be bound 
 ay , in my little groove i was content 
 seeing my life run smoothly to the end 
 with prosy days in stolid labour spent 
 and jolly nights , a pipe , a glass , a friend 
 in god 's good time a hearth fire 's cosy gleam 
 a wife and kids , and all a fellow needs 
 when presto ! like a bubble goes my dream 
 i leap upon the stage of splendid deeds 
 i yell with rage ; i wallow deep in gore 
 i , that was clerk in a drysalter 's store 

the world , that cannot deeme of worthy things 
 when i doe praise her , say i doe but flatter 
 so does the cuckow , when the mavis * sings 
 begin his witlesse note apace to clatter 
 but they , that skill not of so heavenly matter 
 all that they know not , envy or admyre 
 rather then envy , let them wonder at her 
 but not to deeme of her desert aspyre 
 deepe in the closet of my parts entyre 
 her worth is written with a golden quill 
 that me with heavenly fury doth inspire 
 and my glad mouth with her sweet prayses fill 
 which when as fame in her shril trump shall thunder 
 let the world chuse to envy or to wonder 

i would in rich and golden coloured rain 
 with tempting showers in pleasant sort descend 
 into fair phillis ’ lap , my lovely friend 
 when sleep her sense with slumber doth restrain 
 i would be chang è d to a milk white bull 
 when midst the gladsome fields she should appear 
 by pleasant fineness to surprise my dear 
 whilst from their stalks , she pleasant flowers did pull 
 i were content to weary out my pain 
 to be narsissus so she were a spring 
 to drown in her those woes my heart do wring 
 and more ; i wish transform è d to remain 
 that whilst i thus in pleasure 's lap did lie 
 i might refresh desire , which else would die 

new england ! proudly may thy children claim 
 their honored birthright by its humblest name 
 cold are thy skies , but , ever fresh and clear 
 no rank malaria stains thine atmosphere 
 no fungous weeds invade thy scanty soil 
 scarred by the ploughshares of unslumbering toil 
 long may the doctrines by thy sages taught 
 raised from the quarries where their sires have wrought 
 be like the granite of thy rock ribbed land 
 as slow to rear , as obdurate to stand 
 and as the ice that leaves thy crystal mine 
 chills the fierce alcohol in the creole 's wine 
 so may the doctrines of thy sober school 
 keep the hot theories of thy neighbors cool 

what seekest thou far in the unknown land 
 in hope i follow joy gone on before 
 in hope and fear persistent more and more 
 as the dry desert lengthens out its sand 
 whilst day and night i carry in my hand 
 the golden key to ope the golden door 
 of golden home ; yet mine eye weepeth sore 
 for the long journey that must make no stand 
 and who is this that veiled doth walk with thee 
 lo , this is love that walketh at my right 
 one exile holds us both , and we are bound 
 to selfsame home joys in the land of light 
 weeping thou walkest with him ; weepeth he 
 some sobbing weep , some weep and make no sound 

earth has not anything to show more fair 
 dull would he be of soul who could pass by 
 a sight so touching in its majesty 
 this city now doth like a garment wear 
 the beauty of the morning ; silent , bare 
 ships , towers , domes , theaters , and temples lie 
 open unto the fields and to the sky 
 all bright and glittering in the smokeless air 
 never did sun more beautifully steep 
 in his first splendor valley , rock , or hill 
 ne'er saw i , never felt , a calm so deep 
 the river glideth at his own sweet will 
 dear god ! the very houses seem asleep 
 and all that mighty heart is lying still 

then he withdrew , in poverty and pain 
 to this small farm , the last of his domain 
 his only comfort and his only care 
 to prune his vines , and plant the fig and pear 
 his only forester and only guest 
 his falcon , faithful to him , when the rest 
 whose willing hands had found so light of yore 
 the brazen knocker of his palace door 
 had now no strength to lift the wooden latch 
 that entrance gave beneath a roof of thatch 
 companion of his solitary ways 
 purveyor of his feasts on holidays 
 on him this melancholy man bestowed 
 the love with which his nature overflowed 

so when the pretty rill a place espies 
 where with the pebbles she would wantonize 
 and that her upper stream so much doth wrong her 
 to drive her thence , and let her play no longer 
 if she with too loud mutt'ring ran away 
 as being much incens 'd to leave her play 
 a western , mild and pretty whispering gale 
 came dallying with the leaves along the dale 
 and seem 'd as with the water it did chide 
 because it ran so long unpacified 
 yea , and methought it bade her leave that coil 
 or he would choke her up with leaves and soil 
 whereat the riv'let in my mind did weep 
 and hurl 'd her head into a silent deep 

and , like a chorus to the words of grace 
 the ancient fakir , sitting in his place 
 motionless as an idol and as grim 
 in the pavilion akbar built for him 
 under the court yard trees , ( for he was wise 
 knew menu 's laws , and through his close shut eyes 
 saw things far off , and as an open book 
 into the thoughts of other men could look 
 began , half chant , half howling , to rehearse 
 the fragment of a holy vedic verse 
 and thus it ran : “ he who all things forgives 
 conquers himself and all things else , and lives 
 above the reach of wrong or hate or fear 
 calm as the gods , to whom he is most dear 

so long as ioves great bird did make his flight 
 bearing the fire with which heaven doth us fray 
 heaven had not feare of that presumptuous might 
 with which the giaunts did the gods assay 
 but all so soone as scortching sunne had brent 
 his wings which wont the earth to overspredd 
 the earth out of her massie wombe forth sent 
 that antique horror which made heaven adredd 
 then was the germane raven in disguise 
 that romane eagle seene to cleave asunder 
 and towards heaven freshly to arise 
 out of these mountaines , now consum 'd to pouder 
 in which the foule that serves to beare the lightning 
 is now no more seen flying nor alighting 

“ as ever on this side the boiling wave 
 thou seest diminishing , ” the centaur said 
 “ so on the other , be thou well assur 'd 
 it lower still and lower sinks its bed 
 till in that part it reuniting join 
 where ‘ t is the lot of tyranny to mourn 
 there heav'n ' s stern justice lays chastising hand 
 on attila , who was the scourge of earth 
 on sextus , and on pyrrhus , and extracts 
 tears ever by the seething flood unlock 'd 
 from the rinieri , of corneto this 
 pazzo the other nam 'd , who fill 'd the ways 
 with violence and war . ” this said , he turn 'd 
 and quitting us , alone repass 'd the ford 

a link boy once , dick hellfinch stood the grin 
 at charing cross he long his toil apply 'd 
 “ here light , here light ! your honours for a win 
 to every cull and drab he loudly cried 
 in leicester fields , as most the story know 
 “ come black your worship for a single mag 
 and while he shin 'd his nelly suck 'd the bag 
 and thus they sometimes stagg 'd a precious go 
 in smithfield , too , where graziers ’ flats resort 
 he loiter 'd there to take in men of cash 
 with cards and dice was up to ev'ry sport 
 and at saltpetre bank would cut a dash

rare is the loveliness of slow decay 
 with youth and beauty all must be desired 
 but ‘ tis the charm of things long past away 
 they leave , alone , the light they have inspired 
 the calmness of a picture ; memory now 
 is the sole life among the ruins grey 
 and like a phantom in fantastic play 
 she wanders with rank weeds stuck on her brow 
 over grass hidden caves and turret tops 
 herself almost as tottering as they 
 while , to the steps of time , her latest props 
 fall stone by stone , and in the sun 's hot ray 
 all that remains stands up in rugged pride 
 and bridal vines drink in his juices on each side 

when to the public school compelled to go 
 what novel scenes did on my senses flow 
 there in each breast each active power dilates 
 which ‘ broils whole nations , and convulses states 
 their reigns , by turns alternate , love and hate 
 ambition burns , and factious rebels prate 
 and in a smaller range , a smaller sphere 
 the dark deformities of man appear 
 yet there the gentler virtues kindred claim 
 there friendship lights her pure untainted flame 
 there mild benevolence delights to dwell 
 and sweet contentment rests without her cell 
 and there , ‘ mid many a stormy soul , we find 
 the good of heart , the intelligent of mind 

thus saying , hector of the glancing helm 
 turn 'd to depart ; with rapid step he reach 'd 
 his own well furnished house , but found not there 
 his white arm 'd spouse , the fair andromache 
 she with her infant child and maid the while 
 was standing , bath 'd in tears , in bitter grief 
 on ilium 's topmost tower : but when her lord 
 found not within the house his peerless wife 
 upon the threshold pausing , thus he spoke 
 “ tell me , my maidens , tell me true , which way 
 your mistress went , the fair andromache 
 or to my sisters , or my brothers ’ wives 
 or to the temple where the fair hair 'd dames 
 of troy invoke minerva 's awful name 

as when it happ'neth that some lovely town 
 unto a barbarous besieger falls 
 who both by sword and flame himself installs 
 and , shameless , it in tears and blood doth drown 
 her beauty spoil 'd , her citizens made thralls 
 his spite yet cannot so her all throw down 
 but that some statue , pillar of renown 
 yet lurks unmaim 'd within her weeping walls 
 so , after all the spoil , disgrace , and wreck 
 that time , the world , and death , could bring combined 
 amidst that mass of ruins they did make 
 safe and all scarless yet remains my mind 
 from this so high transcending rapture springs 
 that i , all else defaced , not envy kings 

white , glittering sunlight fills the market square 
 spotted and sprigged with shadows . double rows 
 of bartering booths spread out their tempting shows 
 of globed and golden fruit , the morning air 
 smells sweet with ripeness , on the pavement there 
 a wicker basket gapes and overflows 
 spilling out cool , blue plums . the market glows 
 and flaunts , and clatters in its busy care 
 a stately minster at the northern side 
 lifts its twin spires to the distant sky 
 pinnacled , carved and buttressed ; through the wide 
 arched doorway peals an organ , suddenly 
 crashing , triumphant in its pregnant tide 
 quenching the square in vibrant harmony 

thou shouldst have risen as never dawn yet rose 
 day of the sunrise of the soul of france 
 dawn of the whole world 's morning , when the trance 
 of all the world had end , and all its woes 
 respite , prophetic of their perfect close 
 light of all tribes of men , all names and clans 
 dawn of the whole world 's morning and of man 's 
 flower of the heart of morning 's mystic rose 
 dawn of the very dawn of very day 
 when the sun brighter breaks night 's ruinous prison 
 thou shouldst have risen as yet no dawn has risen 
 evoked of him whose word puts night away 
 our father , at the music of whose word 
 exile had ended , and the world had heard 

thou stranger , which for rome in rome hero seekest 
 and nought of rome in rome perceiv'st at all 
 these same olde walls , olde arches , which thou seest 
 olde palaces , is that which rome men call 
 beholde what wreake , what mine , and what wast 
 and how that she which with her mightie powre 
 tam 'd all the world hath tam 'd herselfe at last 
 the pray of time , which all things doth devowre 
 rome now of rome is th'onely funerall 
 and onely rome of rome hath victorie 
 ne ought save tyber hastning to his fall 
 remaines of all : o worlds inconstancie 
 that which is firme doth flit and fall away 
 and that is flitting doth abide and stay 

and gurnemanz deep wondered , and he spoke 
 “ how unlike days of yore her step and way 
 grace in her step and grace in countenance 
 perchance god giveth grace to her sad heart 
 perchance this holy morn hath wrought the change 
 o day of boundless mercy , ‘ twas for this 
 her soul 's salvation and another life 
 that i have wakened her from sleep of death 
 see , with a pitcher comes she from the hut 
 and fills it at the spring !... but who is this 
 that now i see approaching through the woods 
 and drawing slowly near the holy spring 
 yon knight is not a brother of the grail 
 with all that war accoutrement of gloom 

scarce had the voices ceased , when forth there came 
 another candidate for village fame 
 by gratitude to heaven , by honest pride 
 impell 'd to rise and cast his doubts aside 
 a sturdy yeoman , button 'd to the throat 
 faced the whole ring , and shook his leathern coat 
 “ i have a tale of private life to tell 
 “ ‘ tis all of self and home , i know it well 
 “ in love and honour 's cause i would be strong 
 “ mine is a father 's tale , perhaps too long 
 “ for fathers , when a duteous child 's the theme 
 “ can talk a summer 's sun down , and then dream 
 “ of retrospective joys with hearts that glow 
 “ with feelings such as parents only know 

when he the subtle venom had subdued 
 he took her hand , and having fondly sued 
 said he , your pardon lady now i ask 
 be not displeased when i remove the mask 
 your rage restrain ; a trick on you 's been played 
 calimachus am i ; be not dismayed 
 approve my sacrifice ; the secret 's known 
 your rigour would be useless now if shown 
 should i be doomed howe'er to breathe my last 
 i die content , rememb'ring what has passed 
 you have the means my life at will to take 
 more havock with me soft delight could make 
 than any poison that the draught possessed 
 mere folly , imposition , all the rest 

after , at sea a tall ship did appeare 
 made all of heben * and white yvorie 
 the sailes of golde , of silke the tackle were 
 milde was the winde , calme seem 'd the sea to bee 
 the skie eachwhere did show full bright and faire 
 with rich treasures this gay ship fraighted was 
 but sudden storme did so turmoyle the aire 
 and tumbled up the sea , that she , alas 
 strake on a rock , that under water lay 
 and perished past all recoverie 
 o ! how great ruth , and sorrow full assay 
 doth vex my spirite with perplexitie 
 thus in a moment to see lost and drown 'd 
 so great riches as like cannot be found 

voltaire , our england 's lover , man divine 
 beyond all gods that ever fear adored 
 by right and might , by sceptre and by sword 
 by godlike love of sunlike truth , made thine 
 through godlike hate of falsehood 's marshlight shine 
 and all the fume of creeds and deeds abhorred 
 whose light was darkness , till the dawn star soared 
 truth , reason , mercy , justice , keep thy shrine 
 sacred in memory 's temple , seeing that none 
 of all souls born to strive before the sun 
 loved ever good or hated evil more 
 the snake that felt thy heel upon her head 
 night 's first born , writhes as though she were not dead 
 but strikes not , stings not , slays not as before 

where mexic hills the breezy gulph defend 
 spontaneous groves with richer burdens bend 
 anana 's stalk its shaggy honors yields 
 acassia 's flowers perfume a thousand fields 
 their cluster 'd dates the mast like palms unfold 
 the spreading orange waves a load of gold 
 connubial vines o'ertop the larch they climb 
 the long lived olive mocks the moth of time 
 pomona 's pride , that old grenada claims 
 here smiles and reddens in diviner flames 
 pimento , citron scent the sky serene 
 white woolly clusters fringe the cotton 's green 
 the sturdy fig , the frail deciduous cane 
 and foodful cocoa fan the sultry plain 

this life is full of numbness and of balk 
 of haltingness and baffled short coming 
 of promise unfulfilled , of everything 
 that is puffed vanity and empty talk 
 its very bud hangs cankered on the stalk 
 its very song bird trails a broken wing 
 its very spring is not indeed like spring 
 but sighs like autumn round an aimless walk 
 this life we live is dead for all its breath 
 death 's self it is , set off on pilgrimage 
 travelling with tottering steps the first short stage 
 the second stage is one mere desert dust 
 where death sits veiled amid creation 's rust 
 unveil thy face , o death who art not death 

so speaking ceas 'd awhile the enraptur 'd knight 
 for now the two fair damsels met his sight 
 each on her arm resplendent vestments brought 
 fresh from the loom , magnificently wrought 
 enrob 'd in them , with added grace he mov 'd 
 as one by nature form 'd to be belov 'd 
 and , by the fairy to the banquet led 
 and placed beside her on one genial bed 
 whiles the twain handmaids every want supplied 
 cates were his fare to mortal man denied 
 yet was there one , the foremost of the feast 
 one food there was far sweeter than the rest 
 one food there was did feed the warriors flame 
 for from his lady 's lovely lips it came 

but why , the chief replied , if ages past 
 led the bold vagrants to so mild a waste 
 if human souls , for social compact given 
 inform their nature with the stamp of heaven 
 why the wild woods for ever must they rove 
 nor arts nor social joys their passions move 
 long is the lapse of ages , since thy hand 
 conducted here thy first adventurous band 
 on other shores , in every eastern clime 
 since that unletter 'd , distant tract of time 
 what arts have sprung , imperial powers to grace 
 what sceptres sway 'd the many master 'd race 
 guilt , grandeur , glory from their seats been hurl 'd 
 and dire divulsions shook the changing world 

as sheep , that step from forth their fold , by one 
 or pairs , or three at once ; meanwhile the rest 
 stand fearfully , bending the eye and nose 
 to ground , and what the foremost does , that do 
 the others , gath'ring round her , if she stops 
 simple and quiet , nor the cause discern 
 so saw i moving to advance the first 
 who of that fortunate crew were at the head 
 of modest mien and graceful in their gait 
 when they before me had beheld the light 
 from my right side fall broken on the ground 
 so that the shadow reach 'd the cave , they stopp 'd 
 and somewhat back retir 'd : the same did all 
 who follow 'd , though unweeting of the cause 

then with a mighty voice cried out that fiend 
 weighed down with torments , and this word he spake 
 “ long time , o andrew , hast thou been well versed 
 in arts of sorcery ; thou hast deceived 
 and led astray much people ; but thou shalt 
 no longer now have power upon such works 
 for grievous torments are decreed for thee 
 according to thy deeds . with weary heart 
 joyless , degraded , thou shalt suffer woes 
 the bitter pangs of death . my warriors 
 are ready for the battle ; they will soon 
 deprive thee of thy life by valiant deeds 
 what man on earth so mighty that he may 
 release thee from thy bonds , if i oppose 

did you but know the virtuous steps she trod 
 while thus devoted to the little god 
 you 'd thank a hundred times the pow'rs above 
 that gave you such a child to bless your love 
 but many other customs there abound 
 the fair with perfect liberty are found 
 can go and come , whene'er the humour fits 
 no eunuch ( shadow like ) that never quits 
 but watches ev'ry movement :— always feared 
 no men , but who 've upon the chin a beard 
 your daughter from the first , their manners took 
 so easy is her ev'ry act and look 
 and truly to her honour i may say 
 she 's all accommodating ev'ry way 

one day i sought with her hart thrilling eies 
 to make a truce , and termes to entertaine 
 all fearlesse then of so false enimies 
 which sought me to entrap in treasons traine 
 so , as i then disarmed did remaine 
 a wicked ambush , which lay hidden long 
 in the close covert of her guilful eyen 
 thence breaking forth , did thick about me throng 
 too feeble i t'abide the brunt so strong 
 was forst to yield my selfe into their hands 
 who , me captiving streight with rigorous wrong 
 have ever since kept me in cruell bands 
 so , ladie , now to you i doo complaine 
 against your eies , that iustice i may gaine 

dear to my soul , then , leave , me not forsaken 
 fly not ! my heart within thy bosom sleepeth 
 even from myself and sense i have betaken 
 me unto thee for whom my spirit weepeth 
 and on the shore of that salt teary sea 
 couched in a bed of unseen seeming pleasure 
 where in imaginary thoughts thy fair self lay 
 but being waked , robbed of my life 's best treasure 
 i call the heavens , air , earth , and seas to hear 
 my love , my truth , and black disdained estate 
 beating the rocks with bellowings of despair 
 which still with plaints my words reverberate 
 sighing , “ alas , what shall become of me 
 whilst echo cries , “ what shall become of me 

the trito born , the passing wise , beheld 
 and pitied him , and showered upon his head 
 ambrosia , which hath virtue aye to keep 
 taintless , men say , the flesh of warriors slain 
 like softly breathing sleeper dewy fresh 
 she made him : over that dead face she drew 
 a stern frown , even as when he lay , with wrath 
 darkening his grim face , clasping his slain friend 
 patroclus ; and she made his frame to be 
 more massive , like a war god to behold 
 and wonder seized the argives , as they thronged 
 and saw the image of a living man 
 where all the stately length of peleus ’ son 
 lay on the couch , and seemed as though he slept 

but ida stood nor spoke , drained of her force 
 by many a varying influence and so long 
 down through her limbs a drooping languor wept 
 her head a little bent ; and on her mouth 
 a doubtful smile dwelt like a clouded moon 
 in a still water : then brake out my sire 
 lifted his grim head from my wounds . ‘ o you 
 woman , whom we thought woman even now 
 and were half fooled to let you tend our son 
 because he might have wished it — but we see 
 the accomplice of your madness unforgiven 
 and think that you might mix his draught with death 
 when your skies change again : the rougher hand 
 is safer : on to the tents : take up the prince 

one day , whiles that my daylie cares did sleepe 
 my spirit , shaking off her earthly prison 
 began to enter into meditation deepe 
 of things exceeding reach of common reason 
 such as this age , in which all good is geason 
 and all that humble is and meane ** debaced 
 hath brought forth in her last declining season 
 griefe of good mindes , to see goodnesse disgraced 
 on which when as my thought was throghly @ placed 
 unto my eyes strange showes presented were 
 picturing that which i in minde embraced 
 that yet those sights empassion $ me full nere 
 such as they were , faire ladie %, take in worth 
 that when time serves may bring things better forth 

thus he who shakes olympus with his nod 
 then gave to paeon ’ s care the bleeding god 
 with gentle hand the balm he pour ’ d around 
 and heal ’ d the immortal flesh , and closed the wound 
 as when the fig ’ s press ’ d juice , infused in cream 
 to curds coagulates the liquid stream 
 sudden the fluids fix the parts combined 
 such , and so soon , the ethereal texture join ’ d 
 cleansed from the dust and gore , fair hebe dress ’ d 
 his mighty limbs in an immortal vest 
 glorious he sat , in majesty restored 
 fast by the throne of heaven ’ s superior lord 
 juno and pallas mount the bless ’ d abodes 
 their task perform ’ d , and mix among the gods 

timid and smiling , beautiful and shy 
 she drops her head at every passer bye 
 afraid of praise she hurries down the streets 
 and turns away from every smile she meets 
 the forward clown has many things to say 
 and holds her by the gown to make her stay 
 the picture of good health she goes along 
 hale as the morn and happy as her song 
 yet there is one who never feels a fear 
 to whisper pleasing fancies in her ear 
 yet een from him she shuns a rude embrace 
 and stooping holds her hands before her face 
 she even shuns and fears the bolder wind 
 and holds her shawl , and often looks behind 

two voices are there ; one is of the sea 
 one of the mountains ; each a mighty voice 
 in both from age to age thou didst rejoice 
 they were thy chosen music , liberty 
 there came a tyrant , and with holy glee 
 thou fought'st against him ; but hast vainly striven 
 thou from thy alpine holds at length art driven 
 where not a torrent murmurs heard by thee 
 of one deep bliss thine ear hath been bereft 
 then cleave , o cleave to that which still is left 
 for , high soul 'd maid , what sorrow would it be 
 that mountain floods should thunder as before 
 and ocean bellow from his rocky shore 
 and neither awful voice be heard by thee 

thro solid curls of smoke , the bursting fires 
 climb in tall pyramids above the spires 
 concentring all the winds ; whose forces , driven 
 with equal rage from every point of heaven 
 whirl into conflict , round the scantling pour 
 the twisting flames and thro the rafters roar 
 suck up the cinders , send them sailing far 
 to warn the nations of the raging war 
 bend high the blazing vortex , swell 'd and curl 'd 
 careering , brightening o'er the lustred world 
 absorb the reddening clouds that round them run 
 lick the pale stars , and mock their absent sun 
 seas catch the splendor , kindling skies resound 
 and falling structures shake the smouldering ground 

it hath been heretofore my chance to see 
 horsemen with martial order shifting camp 
 to onset sallying , or in muster rang 'd 
 or in retreat sometimes outstretch 'd for flight 
 light armed squadrons and fleet foragers 
 scouring thy plains , arezzo ! have i seen 
 and clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts 
 now with the sound of trumpets , now of bells 
 tabors , or signals made from castled heights 
 and with inventions multiform , our own 
 or introduc 'd from foreign land ; but ne'er 
 to such a strange recorder i beheld 
 in evolution moving , horse nor foot 
 nor ship , that tack 'd by sign from land or star 

oh , had we room to rip the mighty bags 
 that time , the harlequin , has stuffed with rags 
 grant us one moment to unloose the strings 
 while the old graybeard shuts his leather wings 
 but what a heap of motley trash appears 
 crammed in the bundles of successive years 
 as the lost rustic on some festal day 
 stares through the concourse in its vast array 
 where in one cake a throng of faces runs 
 all stuck together like a sheet of buns 
 and throws the bait of some unheeded name 
 or shoots a wink with most uncertain aim 
 so roams my vision , wandering over all 
 and strives to choose , but knows not where to fall 

sweet spirits of the beautiful ! where'er ye dwell 
 whether upon the misty mountain tops 
 with mantling crags about ye , or in dell 
 and sunny valley , by the hazel copse 
 wherein the ring dove nestles , or by streams 
 that wander amid woodlands , with the sheen 
 of noontide trembling through the leafy screen 
 down to their mossy banks in fitful gleams 
 that murmur with the linnets and at e'en 
 sigh with the plaintive nightingale , and oft 
 mirror your bright eyes in the sparkling dew 
 circle me ever with your joyous crew 
 bring inspirations to me bland and soft 
 and sun my slumbers still with happy dreams 

sometimes in verse i praised , sometimes in verse sighed 
 no more shall pen with love and beauty mell 
 but to my heart alone my heart shall tell 
 how unseen flames do burn it day and night 
 lest flames give light , light bring my love to sight 
 and my love prove my folly to excel 
 wherefore my love burns like the fire of hell 
 wherein is fire and yet there is no light 
 for if one never loved like me , then why 
 skill less blames he the thing he doth not know 
 and he that so hath loved should favour show 
 for he hath been a fool as well as i 
 thus shall henceforth more pain , more folly have 
 and folly past , may justly pardon crave 

there 's not a budding boy , or girl , this day 
 but is got up , and gone to bring in may 
 a deal of youth , ere this , is come 
 back , and with white thorn laden home 
 some have dispatch 'd their cakes and cream 
 before that we have left to dream 
 and some have wept , and woo 'd , and plighted troth 
 and chose their priest , ere we can cast off sloth 
 many a green gown has been given 
 many a kiss , both odd and even 
 many a glance , too , has been sent 
 from out the eye , love 's firmament 
 many a jest told of the keys betraying 
 this night , and locks pick 'd :— yet we 're not a maying 

month after month in widowhood of soul 
 drooping the maiden saw two summers roll 
 their suns away — but , ah , how cold and dim 
 even summer suns when not beheld with him 
 from time to time ill omened rumors came 
 like spirit tongues muttering the sick man 's name 
 just ere he dies :— at length those sounds of dread 
 fell withering on her soul , “ azim is dead 
 oh grief beyond all other griefs when fate 
 first leaves the young heart lone and desolate 
 in the wide world without that only tie 
 for which it loved to live or feared to die 
 lorn as the hung up lute , that near hath spoken 
 since the sad day its master chord was broken 

fair matchless nymph , respect but what i crave 
 my thoughts are true , and honour is my love 
 i fainting die whom yet a smile might save 
 you gave the wound , and can the hurt remove 
 those eyes like stars that twinkle in the night 
 and cheeks like rubies pale in lilies dyed 
 those ebon hands that darting hath such might 
 that in my soul my love and life divide 
 accept the passions of a man possessed 
 let love be loved and grant me leave to live 
 disperse those clouds that darkened have my rest 
 and let your heaven a sun like smile but give 
 then shall i praise that heaven for such a sun 
 that saved my life , whenas my grief begun 

were i the poet laureate of the fairies 
 who in a rose leaf finds too broad a page 
 or could i , like your beautiful canaries 
 sing with free heart and happy , in a cage 
 perhaps i might within this little space 
 ( as in some eastern tale , by magic power 
 a giant is imprisoned in a flower 
 have told you something with a poet 's grace 
 but i need wider limits , ampler scope 
 a world of freedom for a world of passion 
 and even then , the glory of my hope 
 would not be uttered in its stateliest fashion 
 yet , lady , when fit language shall have told it 
 you 'll find one little heart enough to hold it 

in those good days when we were young and wise 
 you spake to music , you with the thoughtful eyes 
 and god looked down from heaven , pleased to hear 
 a young man 's song arise so firm and clear 
 has fancy died ? the morning star gone cold 
 why are you silent ? have we grown so old 
 must i alone keep playing ? will not you 
 lord of the measures , string your lyre anew 
 lover of greece , is this the richest store 
 you bring us ,— withered leaves and dusty lore 
 and broken vases widowed of their wine 
 to brand you pedant while you stand divine 
 decorous words beseem the learned lip 
 but poets have the nicer scholarship 

men may pursue the beautiful , while they 
 love not the good , the life of all the fair 
 keen eyed for beauty , they will find it where 
 the darkness of their eyes hath power to slay 
 the vision of the good in beauty 's ray 
 though fruits the same life giving branches bear 
 so in a statue they will see the rare 
 beauty of thought moulded of dull crude clay 
 while loving joys nor prayer their souls expand 
 so thou didst mould thy thoughts in life not art 
 teaching with human voice , and eye , and hand 
 that none the beauty from the truth might part 
 their oneness in thy flesh we joyous hail 
 the holy of holies ’ cloud illumined veil 

for shame deny that thou bear'st love to any 
 who for thy self art so unprovident 
 grant if thou wilt , thou art beloved of many 
 but that thou none lov'st is most evident 
 for thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate 
 that ‘ gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire 
 seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate 
 which to repair should be thy chief desire 
 o change thy thought , that i may change my mind 
 shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love 
 be as thy presence is gracious and kind 
 or to thy self at least kind hearted prove 
 make thee another self for love of me 
 that beauty still may live in thine or thee 

the insect world , now sunbeams higher climb 
 oft dream of spring , and wake before their time 
 bees stroke their little legs across their wings 
 and venture short flights where the snow drop hings 
 its silver bell , and winter aconite 
 its buttercup like flowers that shut at night 
 with green leaf furling round its cup of gold 
 like tender maiden muffled from the cold 
 they sip and find their honey dreams are vain 
 then feebly hasten to their hives again 
 the butterflies , by eager hopes undone 
 glad as a child come out to greet the sun 
 beneath the shadows of a sunny shower 
 are lost , nor see to morrow 's april flower 

it may indeed be phantasy , when i 
 essay to draw from all created things 
 deep , heartfelt , inward joy that closely clings 
 and trace in leaves and flowers that round me lie 
 lessons of love and earnest piety 
 so let it be ; and if the wide world rings 
 in mock of this belief , it brings 
 nor fear , nor grief , nor vain perplexity 
 so will i build my altar in the fields 
 and the blue sky my fretted dome shall be 
 and the sweet fragrance that the wild flower yields 
 shall be the incense i will yield to thee 
 thee only god ! and thou shalt not despise 
 even me , the priest of this poor sacrifice 

the crystal stream wherein my love did swim 
 melted in tears as partners of my woe 
 her shine was such as did the fountain dim 
 the pearl like fountain whiter than the snow 
 then like perfume , resolv è d with a heat 
 the fountain smoked , as if it thought to burn 
 a wonder strange to see the cold so great 
 and yet the fountain into smoke to turn 
 i searched the cause , and found it to be this 
 she touched the water , and it burned with love 
 now by her means it purchased hath that bliss 
 which all diseases quickly can remove 
 then if by you these streams thus bless è d be 
 sweet , grant me love , and be not worse to me 

thus mortal war was wag 'd on either side 
 meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide 
 for , anxious , from evander when he went 
 he sought the tyrrhene camp , and tarchon 's tent 
 expos 'd the cause of coming to the chief 
 his name and country told , and ask 'd relief 
 propos 'd the terms ; his own small strength declar 'd 
 what vengeance proud mezentius had prepar 'd 
 what turnus , bold and violent , design 'd 
 then shew 'd the slipp'ry state of humankind 
 and fickle fortune ; warn 'd him to beware 
 and to his wholesome counsel added pray'r 
 tarchon , without delay , the treaty signs 
 and to the trojan troops the tuscan joins 

still flies achilles , but before his eyes 
 still swift scamander rolls where ’ er he flies 
 not all his speed escapes the rapid floods 
 the first of men , but not a match for gods 
 oft as he turn ’ d the torrent to oppose 
 and bravely try if all the powers were foes 
 so oft the surge , in watery mountains spread 
 beats on his back , or bursts upon his head 
 yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves 
 and still indignant bounds above the waves 
 tired by the tides , his knees relax with toil 
 wash ’ d from beneath him slides the slimy soil 
 when thus ( his eyes on heaven ’ s expansion thrown 
 forth bursts the hero with an angry groan 

be not displeased that these my papers should 
 bewray unto the world how fair thou art 
 or that my wits have showed the best they could 
 the chastest flame that ever warm è d heart 
 think not , sweet delia , this shall be thy shame 
 my muse should sound thy praise with mournful warble 
 how many live , the glory of whose name 
 shall rest in ice , while thine is graved in marble 
 thou mayst in after ages live esteemed 
 unburied in these lines , reserved in pureness 
 these shall entomb those eyes , that have redeemed 
 me from the vulgar , thee from all obscureness 
 although my careful accents never moved thee 
 yet count it no disgrace that i loved thee 

there is a race which cold , ungenial skies 
 breed from decay , as fungous growths arise 
 though dying fast , yet springing fast again 
 which still usurps an unsubstantial reign 
 with frames too languid for the charms of sense 
 and minds worn down with action too intense 
 tired of a world whose joys they never knew 
 themselves deceived , yet thinking all untrue 
 scarce men without , and less than girls within 
 sick of their life before its cares begin 
 the dull disease , which drains their feeble hearts 
 to life 's decay some hectic thrill 's imparts 
 and lends a force which , like the maniac 's power 
 pays with blank years the frenzy of an hour 

now hearkening thus , they both became aware 
 of distant bells that throbbed upon the air 
 a faint , insistent sound that rose and fell 
 a clamour vague that ominous did swell 
 as thus they stood , well hidden from the road 
 footsteps they heard of feet that briskly strode 
 and , through the leaves , a small man they espied 
 who came apace , a great sword by his side 
 large bascinet upon his head he bore 
 ‘ neath which his face a scowl portentous wore 
 while after toiled a stout but reverend friar 
 who , scant of breath , profusely did perspire 
 and , thus perspiring , panted sad complaints 
 thus — on the heat , his comrade and the saints 

miracle of the world ! i never will deny 
 that former poets praise the beauty of their days 
 but all those beauties were but figures of thy praise 
 and all those poets did of thee but prophesy 
 thy coming to the world hath taught us to descry 
 what petrarch 's laura meant , for truth the lip bewrays 
 lo , why th ’ italians , yet which never saw thy rays 
 to find out petrarch 's sense such forg è d glosses try 
 the beauties which he in a veil enclosed beheld 
 but revelations were within his surest heart 
 by which in parables thy coming he foretold 
 his songs were hymns of thee , which only now before 
 thy image should be sung ; for thou that goddess art 
 which only we without idolatry adore 

next came a blooming boy in robe of green 
 on his fair brow a flowery crown was seen 
 where the pale primrose with the cowslip vied 
 and fragrant violets shone in purple pride 
 upon a bull he rode , whose horns were gay 
 with many a golden flower and budding spray 
 around him every vernal songster fled 
 while the lark soar 'd and whistled o'er his head 
 and now he smil 'd with joy , and now , apace 
 the crystal tears bedew 'd his alter 'd face 
 like the young fondling on his mother 's breast 
 who cries for absent joys , and thinks them best 
 ‘ mid smiles , and tears , and frowns , he onward came 
 with gentle pace ,— and april was his name 

oh pleasing thoughts , apprentices of love 
 fore runners of desire , sweet mithridates 
 the poison of my sorrows to remove 
 with whom my hopes and fear full oft debates 
 enrich yourselves and me by your self riches 
 which are the thoughts you spend on heaven bred beauty 
 rouse you my muse beyond our poets ’ pitches 
 and , working wonders , yet say all is duty 
 use you no eaglets ’ eyes , nor phoenix ’ feathers 
 to tower the heaven from whence heaven 's wonder sallies 
 for why ? your sun sings sweetly to her weathers 
 making a spring of winter in the valleys 
 show to the world though poor and scant my skill is 
 how sweet thoughts be , that are but thought on phillis 

straightway did andrew answer him again 
 “ my lord , how can i o'er the ocean deep 
 my course accomplish , to that distant shore 
 as speedily as thou , o king of glory 
 creator of the heavens , dost command 
 that road thine angel can more easily 
 traverse from heaven ; he knows the watery ways 
 the salt sea streams , the wide path of the swan 
 the battle of the surf against the shore 
 the terror of the waters , and the tracks 
 across the boundless land . these foreign men 
 are not my trusty friends , nor do i know 
 in any wise the counsels of this folk 
 to me the cold sea highways are unknown 

the holly bush , a sober lump of green 
 shines through the leafless shrubs all brown and grey 
 and smiles at winter be it eer so keen 
 with all the leafy luxury of may 
 and o it is delicious , when the day 
 in winter 's loaded garment keenly blows 
 and turns her back on sudden falling snows 
 to go where gravel pathways creep between 
 arches of evergreen that scarce let through 
 a single feather of the driving storm 
 and in the bitterest day that ever blew 
 the walk will find some places still and warm 
 where dead leaves rustle sweet and give alarm 
 to little birds that flirt and start away 

ah ! who can e'er forget so fair a being 
 who can forget her half retiring sweets 
 god ! she is like a milk white lamb that bleats 
 for man 's protection . surely the all seeing 
 who joys to see us with his gifts agreeing 
 will never give him pinions , who intreats 
 such innocence to ruin ,— who vilely cheats 
 a dove like bosom . in truth there is no freeing 
 one 's thoughts from such a beauty ; when i hear 
 a lay that once i saw her hand awake 
 her form seems floating palpable , and near 
 had i e'er seen her from an arbour take 
 a dewy flower , oft would that hand appear 
 and o'er my eyes the trembling moisture shake 

one spirit it is that stirs the fathomless deep 
 of human minds , that shakes the elms in storm 
 that sings in passionate music , or on warm 
 still evenings bosoms forth the tufted sleep 
 of thistle seeds that wait a travelling wind 
 one spirit shapes the subtle rhythms of thought 
 and the long thundering seas ; the soul is wrought 
 of one stuff with the body — matter and mind 
 woven together in so close a mesh 
 that flowers may blossom into a song , that flesh 
 may strangely teach the loveliest holiest things 
 to watching spirits . truth is brought to birth 
 not in some vacant heaven : its beauty springs 
 from the dear bosom of material earth 

though god , as one that is an householder 
 called these to labour in his vine yard first 
 before the husk of darkness was well burst 
 bidding them grope their way out and bestir 
 ( who , questioned of their wages , answered , ‘ sir 
 unto each man a penny : ’ ) though the worst 
 burthen of heat was theirs and the dry thirst 
 though god hath since found none such as these were 
 to do their work like them :— because of this 
 stand not ye idle in the market place 
 which of ye knoweth he is not that last 
 who may be first by faith and will ?— yea , his 
 the hand which after the appointed days 
 and hours shall give a future to their past 

th ’ escorting spirits turn 'd with gentle looks 
 toward me , and the mantuan spake : “ my son 
 here torment thou mayst feel , but canst not death 
 remember thee , remember thee , if i 
 safe e'en on geryon brought thee : now i come 
 more near to god , wilt thou not trust me now 
 of this be sure : though in its womb that flame 
 a thousand years contain 'd thee , from thy head 
 no hair should perish . if thou doubt my truth 
 approach , and with thy hands thy vesture 's hem 
 stretch forth , and for thyself confirm belief 
 lay now all fear , o lay all fear aside 
 turn hither , and come onward undismay 'd 
 i still , though conscience urg 'd ’ no step advanc 'd 

kindness gave solitude the lovely light 
 she loved , and made less terrible black midnight 
 even as a bird its unlearned music pours 
 though windows all be blind and shut the doors 
 and sings on still though no faint sound be heard 
 but wind and leaves and another lonely bird 
 so poured she untaught kindness all around 
 and in that human music comfort found 
 music her own and music heard from others 
 prime music of all lovers , children , mothers 
 precarious music between all men sounding 
 the horror of silent and dark powers confounding 
 singing that music she could bravely live 
 hearing it , find less sorrow to forgive 

“ long as ‘ t is lawful for me , shall my steps 
 follow on thine ; and since the cloudy smoke 
 forbids the seeing , hearing in its stead 
 shall keep us join 'd . ” i then forthwith began 
 “ yet in my mortal swathing , i ascend 
 to higher regions , and am hither come 
 through the fearful agony of hell 
 and , if so largely god hath doled his grace 
 that , clean beside all modern precedent 
 he wills me to behold his kingly state 
 from me conceal not who thou wast , ere death 
 had loos 'd thee ; but instruct me : and instruct 
 if rightly to the pass i tend ; thy words 
 the way directing as a safe escort 

and helen , fairest among women , thus 
 answered : “ dear second father , whom at once 
 i fear and honor , would that cruel death 
 had overtaken me before i left 
 to wander with thy son , my marriage bed 
 and my dear daughter , and the company 
 of friends i loved . but that was not to be 
 and now i pine and weep . yet will i tell 
 what thou dost ask . the hero whom thou seest 
 is the wide ruling agamemnon , son 
 of atreus , and is both a gracious king 
 and a most dreaded warrior . he was once 
 brother in law to me , if i may speak 
 lost as i am to shame — of such a tie 

in the old age black was not counted fair 
 or if it were it bore not beauty 's name 
 but now is black beauty 's successive heir 
 and beauty slandered with a bastard shame 
 for since each hand hath put on nature 's power 
 fairing the foul with art 's false borrowed face 
 sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower 
 but is profaned , if not lives in disgrace 
 therefore my mistress ’ eyes are raven black 
 her eyes so suited , and they mourners seem 
 at such who not born fair no beauty lack 
 slandering creation with a false esteem 
 yet so they mourn becoming of their woe 
 that every tongue says beauty should look so 

“ lady , i swear your saad 's horse 
 the prophet himself might have rode a worse 
 like the knots of a serpent the play of his flesh 
 as he tore to the quarry in allah 's mesh 
 i forgot him , and mowed at the traitor weeds 
 which fell before me like rushes and reeds 
 or like the tall poppies that sudden drop low 
 their heads to an urchin 's unstrung bow 
 fled the giaour ; the faithful flew after to kill 
 i turned to surrender : beneath me still 
 was abdon unjaded , fresh in force 
 faithful and fearless — a heavenly horse 
 give him water , lady , and barley to eat 
 then haste thee and fetter the wine bibber 's feet 

as the blind man behind his leader walks 
 lest he should err , or stumble unawares 
 on what might harm him , or perhaps destroy 
 i journey 'd through that bitter air and foul 
 still list'ning to my escort 's warning voice 
 “ look that from me thou part not . ” straight i heard 
 voices , and each one seem 'd to pray for peace 
 and for compassion , to the lamb of god 
 that taketh sins away . their prelude still 
 was “ agnus dei , ” and through all the choir 
 one voice , one measure ran , that perfect seem 'd 
 the concord of their song . “ are these i hear 
 spirits , o master ? ” i exclaim 'd ; and he 
 “ thou aim'st aright : these loose the bonds of wrath 

the soul 's rialto hath its merchandize 
 i barter curl for curl upon that mart 
 and from my poet 's forehead to my heart 
 receive this lock which outweighs argosies 
 as purply black , as erst to pindar 's eyes 
 the dim purpureal tresses gloomed athwart 
 the nine white muse brows . for this counterpart 
 the bay crown 's shade , beloved , i surmise 
 still lingers on thy curl , it is so black 
 thus , with a fillet of smooth kissing breath 
 i tie the shadows safe from gliding back 
 and lay the gift where nothing hindereth 
 here on my heart , as on thy brow , to lack 
 no natural heat till mine grows cold in death 

o true , they have a cause , and woe for us 
 while still they have a cause too piteous 
 yet , happy for us when , their cause defined 
 they walk no longer with a stumbler blind 
 and quicken in the virtue of their cause 
 to think me a poor mouther of old saws 
 i wait the issue of a battling age 
 the toilers with your “ troughsters ” now engage 
 instructing them through their acutest sense 
 how close the dangers of indifference 
 already have my people shown their worth 
 more love they light , which folds the love of earth 
 that love to love of labour leads : thence love 
 of humankind — earth 's incense flung above 

i hope and fear , i pray and hold my peace 
 now freeze my thoughts and straight they fry again 
 i now admire and straight my wonders cease 
 i loose my bonds and yet myself restrain 
 this likes me most that leaves me discontent 
 my courage serves and yet my heart doth fail 
 my will doth climb whereas my hopes are spent 
 i laugh at love , yet when he comes i quail 
 the more i strive , the duller bide i still 
 i would be thralled , and yet i freedom love 
 i would redress , yet hourly feed mine ill 
 i would repine , and dare not once reprove 
 and for my love i am bereft of power 
 and strengthless strive my weakness to devour 

you sacred sea nymphs pleasantly disporting 
 amidst this wat'ry world , where now i sail 
 if ever love , or lovers sad reporting 
 had power sweet tears from your fair eyes to hail 
 and you , more gentle hearted than the rest 
 under the northern noon stead sweetly streaming 
 lend those moist riches of your crystal crest 
 to quench the flames from my heart 's æ tna streaming 
 and thou , kind triton , in thy trumpet relish 
 the ruthful accents of my discontent 
 that midst this travel desolate and hellish 
 some gentle wind that listens my lament 
 may prattle in the north in phillis ’ ears 
 “ where phillis wants , damon consumes in tears 

great emperor peacemaker ! well hast , thou done 
 to link to thy long list of victories won 
 this bloodless one , where all alike contend 
 with cultured courtesy , as friend with friend 
 to help the fallen , bid rude passions cease 
 through moral suasion , and re throne blest peace 
 and thou , disraeli , pillar of the state 
 with the proud flush of triumph now elate 
 well hast thou earned thy laurels , nobly won 
 thy queen 's and country 's verdict of “ well done 
 for with far seeing mind , unflinching skill 
 rare tact and talent , calm , consummate skill 
 thou hast , with thy brave colleagues , fought our fight 
 and made stern right triumphant over might 

an old , mad , blind , despised , and dying king 
 princes , the dregs of their dull race , who flow 
 through public scorn ,— mud from a muddy spring 
 rulers who neither see , nor feel , nor know 
 but leech like to their fainting country cling 
 till they drop , blind in blood , without a blow 
 a people starved and stabbed in the untilled field 
 an army , which liberticide and prey 
 makes as a two edged sword to all who wield 
 golden and sanguine laws which tempt and slay 
 religion christless , godless — a book sealed 
 a senate ,— time 's worst statute , unrepealed 
 are graves from which a glorious phantom may 
 burst , to illumine our tempestuous day 

i stand again on the familiar shore 
 and hear the waves of the distracted sea 
 piteously calling and lamenting thee 
 and waiting restless at thy cottage door 
 the rocks , the sea weed on the ocean floor 
 the willows in the meadow , and the free 
 wild winds of the atlantic welcome me 
 then why shouldst thou be dead , and come no more 
 ah , why shouldst thou be dead , when common men 
 are busy with their trivial affairs 
 having and holding ? why , when thou hadst read 
 nature 's mysterious manuscript , and then 
 wast ready to reveal the truth it bears 
 why art thou silent ! why shouldst thou be dead 

i was no coward . country bred and born 
 i had no feeling but the keenest scorn 
 for those fine lady “ ah 's ” and “ oh 's ” of fear 
 so much assumed ( when any man is near 
 but god implanted in each human heart 
 a natural horror , and a sickly dread 
 of that accursed , slimy , creeping thing 
 that squirms a limbless carcass o'er the ground 
 and where that inborn loathing is not found 
 you 'll find the serpent qualities instead 
 who fears it not , himself is next of kin 
 and in his bosom holds some treacherous art 
 whereby to counteract its venomed sting 
 and all are sired by satan — chief of sin 

but be contented when that fell arrest 
 without all bail shall carry me away 
 my life hath in this line some interest 
 which for memorial still with thee shall stay 
 when thou reviewest this , thou dost review 
 the very part was consecrate to thee 
 the earth can have but earth , which is his due 
 my spirit is thine the better part of me 
 so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life 
 the prey of worms , my body being dead 
 the coward conquest of a wretch 's knife 
 too base of thee to be remembered 
 the worth of that , is that which it contains 
 and that is this , and this with thee remains 

when i do count the clock that tells the time 
 and see the brave day sunk in hideous night 
 when i behold the violet past prime 
 and sable curls all silvered o'er with white 
 when lofty trees i see barren of leaves 
 which erst from heat did canopy the herd 
 and summer 's green all girded up in sheaves 
 borne on the bier with white and bristly beard 
 then of thy beauty do i question make 
 that thou among the wastes of time must go 
 since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake 
 and die as fast as they see others grow 
 and nothing ‘ gainst time 's scythe can make defence 
 save breed to brave him , when he takes thee hence 

let us not to an unrestricted day 
 impediments admit . work is not work 
 to our employ é s , but a merry play 
 they do not ask the law 's excuse to shirk 
 ah , no , the canning season is at hand 
 when summer scents are on the air distilled 
 when golden fruits are ripening in the land 
 and silvery tins are gaping to be filled 
 now to the cannery with jocund mien 
 before the dawn come women , girls and boys 
 whose weekly hours ( a hundred and nineteen 
 seem all too short for their industrious joys 
 if this be error and be proved , alas 
 the thompson bewley bills may fail to pass 

and thou , my village ! as again i tread 
 amidst thy living and above thy dead 
 though some fair playmates guard with charter fears 
 their cheeks , grown holy with the lapse of years 
 though with the dust some reverend locks may blend 
 where life 's last mile stone marks the journey 's end 
 on every bud the changing year recalls 
 the brightening glance of morning memory falls 
 still following onward as the months unclose 
 the balmy lilac or the bridal rose 
 and still shall follow , till they sink once more 
 beneath the snow drifts of the frozen shore 
 as when my bark , long tossing in the gale 
 furled in her port her tempest rended sail 

a light wind , from the open casement , fanned 
 my brow and helen 's , as we , hand in hand 
 sat looking out upon the twilight scene 
 in dreamy silence . helen 's dark blue eyes 
 like two lost stars that wandered from the skies 
 some night adown the meteor 's shining track 
 and always had been grieving to go back 
 now gazed up , wistfully , at heaven 's dome 
 and seemed to recognize and long for home 
 her sweet voice broke the silence : “ wish , maurine 
 before you speak ! you know the moon is new 
 and anything you wish for will come true 
 before it wanes . i do believe the sign 
 now tell me your wish , and i 'll tell you mine 

as men in summer fearles passe the foord 
 which is in winter lord of all the plaine 
 and with his tumbling streames doth beare aboord 
 the ploughmans hope and shepheards labour vaine 
 and as the coward beasts use to despise 
 the noble lion after his lives end 
 whetting their teeth , and with vaine foolhardise 
 daring the foe that cannot him defend 
 and as at troy most dastards of the greekes 
 did brave about the corpes of hector colde 
 so those which whilome wont with pallid cheekes 
 the romane triumphs glorie to behold 
 now on these ashie tombes shew boldnesse vaine 
 and , conquer 'd , dare the conquerour disdaine 

and yet , because thou overcomest so 
 because thou art more noble and like a king 
 thou canst prevail against my fears and fling 
 thy purple round me , till my heart shall grow 
 too close against thine heart henceforth to know 
 how it shook when alone . why , conquering 
 may prove as lordly and complete a thing 
 in lifting upward , as in crushing low 
 and as a vanquished soldier yields his sword 
 to one who lifts him from the bloody earth 
 even so , beloved , i at last record 
 here ends my strife . if thou invite me forth 
 i rise above abasement at the word 
 make thy love larger to enlarge my worth 

come time , the anchor hold of my desire 
 my last resort whereto my hopes appeal 
 cause once the date of her disdain t'exspire 
 make her the sentence of her wrath repeal 
 rob her fair brow , break in on beauty , steal 
 power from those eyes which pity cannot spare 
 deal with those dainty cheeks , as she doth deal 
 with this poor heart consum è d with despair 
 this heart made now the pr ò spective of care 
 by loving her , the cruelst fair that lives 
 the cruelst fair that sees i pine for her 
 and never mercy to thy merit gives 
 let her not still triumph over the prize 
 of mine affections taken by her eyes 

last night , as now , i seemed to speak with him 
 or was it but my heart that spoke for him 
 “ thou mak'st me long , ” i said , “ therefore wilt give 
 my longing is thy promise , o my god 
 if , having sinned , i thus have lost the claim 
 why doth the longing yet remain with me 
 and make me bold thus to besiege thy doors 
 methought i heard for answer : “ question on 
 hold fast thy need ; it is the bond that holds 
 thy being yet to mine . i give it thee 
 a hungering and a fainting and a pain 
 yet a god blessing . thou art not quite dead 
 while this pain lives in thee . i bless thee with it 
 better to live in pain than die that death 

the lone man gazed and gazed upon his gold 
 his sweat , his blood , the wage of weary days 
 but now how sweet , how doubly sweet to hold 
 all gay and gleamy to the campfire blaze 
 the evening sky was sinister and cold 
 the willows shivered , wanly lay the snow 
 the uncommiserating land , so old 
 so worn , so grey , so niggard in its woe 
 peered through its ragged shroud . the lone man sighed 
 poured back the gaudy dust into its poke 
 gazed at the seething river listless eyed 
 loaded his corn cob pipe as if to smoke 
 then crushed with weariness and hardship crept 
 into his ragged robe , and swiftly slept 

what better tale could any lover tell 
 when age or death his reckoning shall write 
 than thus , ‘ love taught me only to rebel 
 against these things ,— the thieving of delight 
 without return ; the gospellers of fear 
 who , loving , yet deny the truth they bear 
 sad suited lusts with lecherous hands to smear 
 the cloth of gold they would but dare not wear 
 and love gave me great knowledge of the trees 
 and singing birds , and earth with all her flowers 
 wisdom i knew and righteousness in these 
 i lived in their atonement all my hours 
 love taught me how to beauty 's eye alone 
 the secret of the lying heart is known 

my own beloved , who hast lifted me 
 from this drear flat of earth where i was thrown 
 and in betwixt the languid ringlets , blown 
 a life breath , till the forehead hopefully 
 shines out again , as all the angels see 
 before thy saving kiss ! my own , my own 
 who camest to me when the world was gone 
 and i who looked for only god , found thee 
 i find thee : i am safe , and strong , and glad 
 as one who stands in dewless asphodel 
 looks backward on the tedious time he had 
 in the upper life ... so i , with bosom swell 
 make witness here between the good and bad 
 that love , as strong as death , retrieves as well 

death ! be not proud , though some have called thee 
 mighty and dreadful , for thou art not so 
 for those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow 
 die not , poor death ! nor yet canst thou kill me 
 from rest and sleep , which but thy picture be 
 much pleasure , then , from thee much more must flow 
 and soonest our best men with thee do go 
 rest of their bones , and soul 's delivery 
 thou'rt slave to fate , chance , kings , and desperate men 
 and dost with poison , war , and sickness , dwell 
 and poppy or charms can make us sleep as well 
 and better than thy stroke . why swell'st thou , then 
 one short sleep past we wake eternally 
 and death shall be no more ; death , thou shalt die 

what a night ! the wind howls , hisses , and but stops 
 to howl more loud , while the snow volley keeps 
 incessant batter at the window pane 
 making our comfort feel as sweet again 
 and in the morning , when the tempest drops 
 at every cottage door mountainous heaps 
 of snow lie drifted , that all entrance stops 
 untill the beesom and the shovel gain 
 the path , and leave a wall on either side 
 the shepherd rambling valleys white and wide 
 with new sensations his old memory fills 
 when hedges left at night , no more descried 
 are turned to one white sweep of curving hills 
 and trees turned bushes half their bodies hide 

reader , didst ever see a water spout 
 ‘ tis possible that thou wilt answer , “ no 
 well then ! he makes a most infernal rout 
 sucks , like an elephant , the waves below 
 with huge proboscis reaching from the sky 
 as if he meant to drink the ocean dry 
 at length so full he can n't hold one drop more 
 he bursts down rush the waters with a roar 
 on some poor boat , or sloop , or brig , or ship 
 and almost sinks the wand'rer of the deep 
 thus have i seen a monarch at reviews 
 suck from the tribe of officers the news 
 then bear in triumph off each wondrous matter 
 and souse it on the queen with such a clatter 

peace hath an altar there . the sounding feet 
 of thunder and the ‘ wildering wings of rain 
 against fire rifted summits flash and beat 
 and through grey upper gorges swoop and strain 
 but round that hallowed mountain spring remain 
 year after year , the days of tender heat 
 and gracious nights , whose lips with flowers are sweet 
 and filtered lights , and lutes of soft refrain 
 a still , bright pool . to men i may not tell 
 the secret that its heart of water knows 
 the story of a loved and lost repose 
 yet this i say to cliff and close leaved dell 
 a fitful spirit haunts yon limpid well 
 whose likeness is the faithless face of rose 

“ tweet ” pipes the robin as the cat creeps by 
 her nestling young that in the elderns lie 
 and then the bluecap tootles in its glee 
 picking the flies from orchard apple tree 
 and “ pink ” the chaffinch cries its well known strain 
 urging its kind to utter “ pink ” again 
 while in a quiet mood hedgesparrows try 
 an inward stir of shadowed melody 
 around the rotten tree the firetail mourns 
 as the old hedger to his toil returns 
 chopping the grain to stop the gap close by 
 the hole where her blue eggs in safety lie 
 of everything that stirs she dreameth wrong 
 and pipes her “ tweet tut ” fears the whole day long 

in ida vale three queens the shepherd saw 
 queens of esteem , divine they were all three 
 a sight of worth . but i a wonder shaw 
 their virtues all in one alone to be 
 licia the fair , surpassing venus ’ pride 
 ( the matchless queen , commander of the gods 
 when drawn with doves she in her pomp doth ride 
 hath far more beauty , and more grace by odds 
 juno , jove 's wife , unmeet to make compare 
 i grant a goddess , but not half so mild 
 minerva wise , a virtue , but not rare 
 yet these are mean , if that my love but smiled 
 she them surpasseth , when their prides are full 
 as far as they surpass the meanest trull 

“ ‘ o son of woe , ’ the pensive shade rejoin 'd 
 ‘ o most inured to grief of all mankind 
 “ ‘ tis not the queen of hell who thee deceives 
 all , all are such , when life the body leaves 
 no more the substance of the man remains 
 nor bounds the blood along the purple veins 
 these the funereal flames in atoms bear 
 to wander with the wind in empty air 
 while the impassive soul reluctant flies 
 like a vain dream , to these infernal skies 
 but from the dark dominions speed the way 
 and climb the steep ascent to upper day 
 to thy chaste bride the wondrous story tell 
 the woes , the horrors , and the laws of hell 

thou , poor heart , sacrificed unto the fairest 
 hast sent the incense of thy sighs to heaven 
 and still against her frowns fresh vows repairest 
 and made thy passions with her beauty even 
 and you , mine eyes , the agents of my heart 
 told the dumb message of my hidden grief 
 and oft , with careful tunes , with silent art 
 did treat the cruel fair to yield relief 
 and you , my verse , the advocates of love 
 have followed hard the process of my case 
 and urged that title which doth plainly prove 
 my faith should win , if justice might have place 
 yet though i see that nought we do can move 
 ‘ tis not disdain must make me cease to love 

but chiefly , conscious of thy promised throne 
 intent to grace that destiny sublime 
 thou sought'st to make the historic page thine own 
 and win the treasures of recorded time 
 the forms of polity , the springs of power 
 exploring still with inexhausted zeal 
 still , the pole star which led thy studious hour 
 through thought 's unfolding tracts — thy country 's weal 
 while fancy , radiant with unearthly charms 
 thus breathed the whisper wisdom sanctified 
 “ eliza 's , anna 's glories , arts , or arms 
 beneath thy sway shall blaze revivified 
 and still prolonged , and still augmenting , shine 
 interminably bright in thy illustrious line 

how blest is he who knows no meaner strife 
 than art 's long battle with the foes of life 
 no doubt assails him , doing still his best 
 and trusting kindly nature for the rest 
 no mocking conscience tears the thin disguise 
 that wraps his breast , and tells him that he lies 
 he comes : the languid sufferer lifts his head 
 and smiles a welcome from his weary bed 
 he speaks : what music like the tones that tell 
 “ past is the hour of danger ,— all is well 
 how can he feel the petty stings of grief 
 whose cheering presence always brings relief 
 what ugly dreams can trouble his repose 
 who yields himself to soothe another 's woes 

so saying , he strode on , kunti 's strong son 
 and bhima ; and arjuna followed him 
 and nakalu and the hound ; leaving behind 
 sahadev in the sands . but nakalu 
 weakened and grieved to see sahadev fall 
 his dear loved brother — lagged and stayed ; and then 
 prone on his face he fell , that noble face 
 which had no match for beauty in the land 
 glorious and godlike nakalu ! then sighed 
 bhima anew : “ brother and lord ! the man 
 who never erred from virtue , never broke 
 our fellowship , and never in the world 
 was matched for goodly perfectness of form 
 or gracious feature ,— nakalu has fallen 

toothpick in his boot , so , comparatively speaking 
 he rode all unarmed , and he rode all alone 
 because there was no one going his way 
 he stayed not for brake , and he stopped not for 
 toll gates ; he swam the eske river where ford 
 there was none , and saved fifteen cents 
 in ferriage , but lost his pocket book , containing 
 seventeen dollars and a half , by the operation 
 ere he alighted at the netherby mansion 
 he stopped to borrow a dry suit of clothes 
 and this delayed him considerably , so when 
 he arrived the bride had consented — the gallant 
 came late — for a laggard in love and a dastard in war 
 was to wed the fair ellen , and the guests had assembled 

you think me quite as good as other men 
 nay , more , i think you think me vastly better 
 your candid glances seem to ask me when 
 i 'll seek to bind you in a willing fetter 
 is this presumption ? not from friend to friend 
 whose souls unite like clasping hands of lovers 
 yet can i breathe no word of love , to end 
 the delicate doubt that o'er the unspoken hovers 
 if i were hopeless that you loved me not 
 my hopeless love , confess 'd , myself would flatter 
 but should the blissful dream be true , i wot 
 that love confess 'd the joy of love would shatter 
 my queen , indeed as king i 'd love to lord it 
 i cannot tell you that i can n't afford it 

thus far to hold their battlements was all 
 the greeks had hoped ; now , venturing attack 
 with glittering torches for their arms , by night 
 fearless they sallied forth : nor lance they bear 
 nor deadly bow , nor shaft ; for fire alone 
 is now their weapon . through the roman works 
 driven by the wind the conflagration spread 
 nor did the newness of the wood make pause 
 the fury of the flames , which , fed afresh 
 by living torches , ‘ neath a smoky pall 
 leaped on in fiery tongues . not wood alone 
 but stones gigantic crumbling into dust 
 dissolved beneath the heat ; the mighty mound 
 lay prone , yet in its ruin larger seemed 

but pallas now tydides ’ soul inspires 
 fills with her force , and warms with all her fires 
 above the greeks his deathless fame to raise 
 and crown her hero with distinguish ’ d praise 
 high on his helm celestial lightnings play 
 his beamy shield emits a living ray 
 the unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies 
 like the red star that fires the autumnal skies 
 when fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight 
 and , bathed in ocean , shoots a keener light 
 such glories pallas on the chief bestow ’ d 
 such , from his arms , the fierce effulgence flow ’ d 
 onward she drives him , furious to engage 
 where the fight burns , and where the thickest rage 

it is my dream to have you here with me 
 out of the heated city 's dust and din 
 here where the colts have room to gambol in 
 and kine to graze , in clover to the knee 
 i want to see your wan face happily 
 lit with the wholesome smiles that have not been 
 in use since the old games you used to win 
 when we pitched horseshoes : and i want to be 
 at utter loaf with you in this dim land 
 of grove and meadow , while the crickets make 
 our own talk tedious , and the bat wields 
 his bulky flight , as we cease converse and 
 in a dusk like velvet smoothly take 
 our way toward home across the dewy fields 

in pure goodwill i took this jovial spark 
 of oxford he , a most egregious clerk 
 he boarded with a widow in the town 
 a trusty gossip , one dame alison 
 full well the secrets of my soul she knew 
 better than e'er our parish priest could do 
 to her i told whatever could befall 
 had but my husband piss 'd against a wall 
 or done a thing that might have cost his life 
 she — and my niece — and one more worthy wife 
 had known it all : what most he would conceal 
 to these i made no scruple to reveal 
 oft has he blush 'd from ear to ear for shame 
 that e'er he told a secret to his dame 

weary was love and sought to take his rest 
 he made his choice , upon a virgin 's lap 
 and slyly crept from thence unto her breast 
 where still he meant to sport him in his hap 
 the virgin frowned like phoebus in a cloud 
 “ go pack , sir boy , here is no room for such 
 my breast no wanton foolish boy must shroud 
 this said , my love did give the wag a touch 
 then as the foot that treads the stinging snake 
 hastes to be gone , for fear what may ensue 
 so love my love was forced for to forsake 
 and for more speed , without his arrows flew 
 “ pardon , ” he said , “ for why ? you seemed to me 
 my mother venus in her pride to be 

the chief hung up :— the princess soon appeared 
 her spirits presently our champion cheered 
 the pirate scarcely had her bosom moved 
 no tears at least a marked affection proved 
 but , by her prayers she pardon sought to gain 
 for some who were not in the conflict slain 
 consoled the dying , and lamented those 
 who , by the sword , had closed their book of woes 
 then left the place without the least regret 
 where such adventures and alarms she 'd met 
 ‘ tis said , indeed , she presently forgot 
 the two gallants who last became her lot 
 and i can easily the fact believe 
 removed from sight , but few for lovers grieve 

heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate 
 all but the page prescribed , their present state 
 from brutes what men , from men what spirits know 
 or who could suffer being here below 
 the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to day 
 had he thy reason , would he skip and play 
 pleased to the last , he crops the flowery food 
 and licks the hand just raised to shed his blood 
 oh , blindness to the future ! kindly given 
 that each may fill the circle marked by heaven 
 who sees with equal eye , as god of all 
 a hero perish , or a sparrow fall 
 atoms or systems into ruin hurled 
 and now a bubble burst , and now a world 

‘ twas on the morn ’ when heaven its blessed ray 
 in pity to its suffering master veil 'd 
 first did i , lady , to your beauty yield 
 of your victorious eyes th ’ unguarded prey 
 ah ! little reck 'd i that , on such a day 
 needed against love 's arrows any shield 
 and trod ’ securely trod , the fatal field 
 whence , with the world 's , began my heart 's dismay 
 on every side love found his victim bare 
 and through mine eyes transfix 'd my throbbing heart 
 those eyes , which now with constant sorrows flow 
 but poor the triumph of his boasted art 
 who thus could pierce a naked youth nor dare 
 to you in armour mail 'd even to display his bow 

see ! how the stubborne damzell doth deprave 
 my simple meaning with disdaynfull scorne 
 and by the bay which i unto her gave 
 accoumpts my self her captive quite forlorne 
 the bay , quoth she , is of the victours born 
 yielded them by the vanquisht as theyr meeds 
 and they therewith doe poetes heads adorne 
 to sing the glory of their famous deeds 
 but sith she will the conquest challeng needs 
 let her accept me as her faithfull thrall 
 that her great triumph , which my skill exceeds 
 i may in trump of fame blaze over all 
 then would i decke her head with glorious bayes 
 and fill the world with her victorious prayse 

we talk of taxes , and i call you friend 
 well , such you are ,— but well enough we know 
 how thick about us root , how rankly grow 
 those subtle weeds no man has need to tend 
 that flourish through neglect , and soon must send 
 perfume too sweet upon us and overthrow 
 our steady senses ; how such matters go 
 we are aware , and how such matters end 
 yet shall be told no meagre passion here 
 with lovers such as we forevermore 
 isolde drinks the draught , and guinevere 
 receives the table 's ruin through her door 
 francesca , with the loud surf at her ear 
 lets fall the colored book upon the floor 

“ not without purpose once more to return 
 thou find'st me , my casella , where i am 
 journeying this way ; ” i said , “ but how of thee 
 hath so much time been lost ? ” he answer 'd straight 
 “ no outrage hath been done to me , if he 
 who when and whom he chooses takes , me oft 
 this passage hath denied , since of just will 
 his will he makes . these three months past indeed 
 he , whose chose to enter , with free leave 
 hath taken ; whence i wand'ring by the shore 
 where tyber 's wave grows salt , of him gain 'd kind 
 admittance , at that river 's mouth , tow'rd which 
 his wings are pointed , for there always throng 
 all such as not to archeron descend 

rise from your gory ashes stern and pale 
 ye martyred thousands ! and with dreadful ire 
 a voice of doom , a front of gloomy fire 
 rebuke those faithless souls , whose querulous wail 
 disturbs your sacred sleep !— “ the withering hail 
 of battle , hunger , pestilence , despair 
 whatever of mortal anguish man may bear 
 we bore unmurmuring ! strengthened by the mail 
 of a most holy purpose !— then we died 
 vex not our rest by cries of selfish pain 
 but to the noblest measure of your powers 
 endure the appointed trial ! griefs defied 
 but launch their threatening thunderbolts in vain 
 and angry storms pass by in gentlest showers 

long has the pall of midnight quench 'd the scene 
 and wrapt the hush 'd horizon .— all around 
 in scatter 'd huts , labor , in sleep profound 
 lies stretch 'd , and rosy innocence serene 
 slumbers ;— but creeps , with pale and starting mien 
 benighted superstition .— fancy found 
 the late self slaughter 'd man , in earth yet green 
 and festering , burst from his incumbent mound 
 roams !— and the slave of terror thinks he hears 
 a mutter 'd groan !— sees the sunk eye , that glares 
 as shoots the meteor .— but no more forlorn 
 he strays ;— the spectre sinks into his tomb 
 for now the jocund herald of the morn 
 claps his bold wings , and sounds along the gloom 

again i follow it , throughout the day 
 with anxious eyes i see it trip and fall 
 and hurt itself in many a foolish way 
 childlike , unheeding warning word or call 
 i see it grasp , and grasping , break the toys 
 it cried to own , then toss them on the floor 
 and , breathless , hurry after fancied joys 
 that cease to please , when added to its store 
 i see the lacerations on its hands 
 made by forbidden tools ; but when it weeps 
 i also weep , as one who understands 
 and having been a child , the memory keeps 
 ah , my poor world , however wrong thy part 
 still is there pity in my mother heart 

to one who has been long in city pent 
 ‘ tis very sweet to look into the fair 
 and open face of heaven ,— to breathe a prayer 
 full in the smile of the blue firmament 
 who is more happy , when , with hearts content 
 fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair 
 of wavy grass , and reads a debonair 
 and gentle tale of love and languishment 
 returning home at evening , with an ear 
 catching the notes of philomel ,— an eye 
 watching the sailing cloudlet 's bright career 
 he mourns that day so soon has glided by 
 e'en like the passage of an angel 's tear 
 that falls through the clear ether silently 

without delay they to the convent flew 
 but when the holy mansion came in view 
 respect , the place of execution changed 
 a citizen his barn for this arranged 
 the crafty crew together were confined 
 and in the blaze their wretched lives resigned 
 while round the husbands danced at sound of drum 
 and burnt whatever to their hands had come 
 naught ‘ scaped their fury , monks of all degrees 
 robes , mantles , capuchins , and mock decrees 
 all perished properly within the flames 
 but nothing more i find about the dames 
 and friar gerard , in another place 
 had met apart his merited disgrace 

as one of some fat tillage dispossessed 
 weighing the yield of these four faded years 
 if any ask what fruit seems loveliest 
 what lasting gold among the garnered ears 
 ah , then i 'll say what hours i had of thine 
 therein i reaped time 's richest revenue 
 read in thy text the sense of david 's line 
 through thee achieved the love that shakespeare knew 
 take then his book , laden with mine own love 
 as flowers made sweeter by deep drunken rain 
 that when years sunder and between us move 
 wide waters , and less kindly bonds constrain 
 thou may'st turn here , dear boy , and reading see 
 some part of what thy friend once felt for thee 

fools be they that inveigh ‘ gainst mahomet 
 who 's but a moral of love 's monarchy 
 but a dull adamant , as straw by jet 
 he in an iron chest was drawn on high 
 in midst of mecca 's temple roof , some say 
 he now hangs without touch or stay at all 
 that mahomet is she to whom i pray 
 may ne'er man pray so ineffectual 
 mine eyes , love 's strange exhaling adamants 
 un'wares , to my heart 's temple 's height have wrought 
 the iron idol that compassion wants 
 who my oft tears and travails sets at nought 
 iron hath been transformed to gold by art 
 her face , limbs , flesh and all , gold ; save her heart 

children of later growth , we love the play 
 we love its heroes , be they grave or gay 
 from squeaking , peppery , devil defying punch 
 to roaring richard with his camel hunch 
 adore its heroines , those immortal dames 
 time 's only rivals , whom he never tames 
 whose youth , unchanging , lives while thrones decay 
 ( age spares the pyramids and dejazet 
 the saucy aproned , razor tongued soubrette 
 the blond haired beauty with the eyes of jet 
 the gorgeous beings whom the viewless wires 
 lift to the skies in strontian crimsoned fires 
 and all the wealth of splendor that awaits 
 the throng that enters those elysian gates 

i saw her like a shadow on the sky 
 in the last light , a blur upon the sea 
 then the gale 's darkness put the shadow by 
 but from one grave that island talked to me 
 and , in the midnight , in the breaking storm 
 i saw its blackness and a blinking light 
 and thought , “ so death obscures your gentle form 
 so memory strives to make the darkness bright 
 and , in that heap of rocks , your body lies 
 part of the island till the planet ends 
 my gentle comrade , beautiful and wise 
 part of this crag this bitter surge offends 
 while i , who pass , a little obscure thing 
 war with this force , and breathe , and am its king 

fair grace of graces , muse of muses all 
 thou paradise , thou only heaven i know 
 what influence hath bred my hateful woe 
 that i from thee and them am forced to fall 
 thou falled from me , from thee i never shall 
 although my fortunes thou hast brought so low 
 yet shall my faith and service with thee go 
 for live i do , on heaven and thee to call 
 banish 'd all grace , no graces with me dwell 
 compelled to muse , my muses from me fly 
 excluded heaven , what can remain but hell 
 exiled from paradise , in hate i lie 
 cursing my stars ; albeit i find it true 
 i lost all these when i lost love and you 

captain sword , like a witless thing 
 of all under heaven must needs be king 
 king of kings , and lord of lords 
 swayer of souls as well as of swords 
 ruler of speech , and through speech , of thought 
 and hence to his brain was a madness brought 
 he madden 'd in east , he madden 'd in west 
 fiercer for sights of men 's unrest 
 fiercer for talk , amongst awful men 
 of their new mighty leader , captain pen 
 a conqueror strange , who sat in his home 
 like the wizard that plagued the ships of rome 
 noiseless , show less , dealing no death 
 but victories , winged , went forth from his breath 

no sooner on my vision streaming , smote 
 the heav'nly influence , which years past , and e'en 
 in childhood , thrill 'd me , than towards virgil i 
 turn 'd me to leftward , panting , like a babe 
 that flees for refuge to his mother 's breast 
 if aught have terrified or work 'd him woe 
 and would have cried : “ there is no dram of blood 
 that doth not quiver in me . the old flame 
 throws out clear tokens of reviving fire 
 but virgil had bereav 'd us of himself 
 virgil , my best lov 'd father ; virgil , he 
 to whom i gave me up for safety : nor 
 all , our prime mother lost , avail 'd to save 
 my undew 'd cheeks from blur of soiling tears 

whenas my love lay sickly in her bed 
 pale death did post in hope to have a prey 
 but she so spotless made him that he fled 
 “ unmeet to die , ” she cried , and could not stay 
 back he retired , and thus the heavens he told 
 “ all things that are , are subject unto me 
 both towns , and men , and what the world doth hold 
 but her fair licia still immortal be 
 the heavens did grant ; a goddess she was made 
 immortal , fair , unfit to suffer change 
 so now she lives , and never more shall fade 
 in earth a goddess , what can be more strange 
 then will i hope , a goddess and so near 
 she cannot choose my sighs and prayers but hear 

“ an upstart multitude and sudden gains 
 pride and excess , o florence ! have in thee 
 engender 'd , so that now in tears thou mourn'st 
 thus cried i with my face uprais 'd , and they 
 all three , who for an answer took my words 
 look 'd at each other , as men look when truth 
 comes to their ear . “ if thou at other times 
 they all at once rejoin 'd , “ so easily 
 satisfy those , who question , happy thou 
 gifted with words , so apt to speak thy thought 
 wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime 
 returning to behold the radiant stars 
 when thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past 
 see that of us thou speak among mankind 

since i did leave the presence of my love 
 many long weary dayes i have outworne 
 and many nights , that slowly seemd to move 
 theyr sad protract from evening untill morn 
 for , when as day the heaven doth adorne 
 i wish that night the noyous day would end 
 and when as night hath us of light forlorne 
 i wish that day would shortly reascend 
 thus i the time with expectation spend 
 and faine my griefe with chaunges to beguile 
 that further seemes his terme still to extend 
 and maketh every minute seem a myle 
 so sorrowe still doth seem too long to last 
 but ioyous houres do fly away too fast 

she did n't faint ; she knelt by my side 
 an ’ thanked the lord , till i fairly cried 
 an ’ maybe our ride was n't pleasant an ’ gay 
 an ’ maybe she was n't wrapped up that day 
 an ’ maybe our cottage was n't warm an ’ bright 
 an ’ maybe it was n't a pleasant sight 
 to see her a gettin ’ the evenin 's tea 
 an ’ frequently stoppin ’ and kissin ’ me 
 an ’ maybe we did n't live happy for years 
 in spite of my brothers ’ and sisters ’ sneers 
 who often said , as i have heard 
 that they would n't own a prison bird 
 ( though they 're gettin ’ over that , i guess 
 for all of ‘ em owe me more or less 

sweet bird , that sing'st away the early hours 
 of winters past or coming , void of care 
 well pleased with delights which present are 
 fair seasons , budding sprays , sweet smelling flowers 
 to rocks , to springs , to rills , from leafy bowers 
 thou thy creator 's goodness dost declare 
 and what dear gifts on thee he did not spare 
 a stain to human sense in sin that lowers 
 what soul can be so sick , which by thy songs 
 attired in sweetness , sweetly is not driven 
 quite to forget earth 's turmoils , spites , and wrongs 
 and lift a reverend eye and thought to heaven 
 sweet artless songster , thou my mind dost raise 
 to airs of spheres , yes , and to angels ’ lays 

yet why , you ask , these humble crimes relate 
 why make the poor as guilty as the great 
 to show the great , those mightier sons of pride 
 how near in vice the lowest are allied 
 such are their natures and their passions such 
 but these disguise too little , those too much 
 so shall the man of power and pleasure see 
 in his own slave as vile a wretch as he 
 in his luxurious lord the servant find 
 his own low pleasures and degenerate mind 
 and each in all the kindred vices trace 
 of a poor , blind , bewildered , erring race 
 who , a short time in varied fortune past 
 die , and are equal in the dust at last 

‘ oft , when the world imagine women stray 
 the sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way 
 through all the giddy circle they pursue 
 and old impertinence expel by new 
 what tender maid but must a victim fall 
 to one man 's treat , but for another 's ball 
 when florio speaks , what virgin could withstand 
 if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand 
 with varying vanities , from every part 
 they shift the moving toyshop of their heart 
 where wigs with wigs , with sword knots sword knots strive 
 beaux banish beaux , and coaches coaches drive 
 this erring mortals levity may call 
 oh , blind to truth ! the sylphs contrive it all 

we mourn not for our martyrs !— for they perish 
 as the good perish , for a deathless faith 
 their glorious memories men will fondly cherish 
 in terms and signs that shall ennoble death 
 their blood becomes a principle , to guide 
 onward , forever onward , in proud flow 
 restless , resistless , as the ocean tide 
 the spirit heaven yields freedom here below 
 how should we mourn the martyrs , who arise 
 even from the stake and scaffold , to the skies 
 and take their thrones , as slars ; and o'er the night 
 shed a new glory ; and to other souls 
 shine out with blessed guidance , and true light 
 which leads successive races to their goals 

the young queen nature , ever sweet and fair 
 once on a time fell upon evil days 
 from hearing oft herself discussed with praise 
 there grew within her heart the longing rare 
 to see herself ; and every passing air 
 the warm desire fanned into lusty blaze 
 full oft she sought this end by devious ways 
 but sought in vain , so fell she in despair 
 for none within her train nor by her side 
 could solve the task or give the envied boon 
 so day and night , beneath the sun and moon 
 she wandered to and fro unsatisfied 
 till art came by , a blithe inventive elf 
 and made a glass wherein she saw herself 

i once may see when years shall wreck my wrong 
 and golden hairs shall change to silver wire 
 and those bright rays that kindle all this fire 
 shall fail in force , their working not so strong 
 then beauty , now the burden of my song 
 whose glorious blaze the world doth so admire 
 must yield up all to tyrant time 's desire 
 then fade those flowers that decked her pride so long 
 when if she grieve to gaze her in her glass 
 which then presents her whiter withered hue 
 go you , my verse , go tell her what she was 
 for what she was , she best shall find in you 
 your fiery heat lets not her glory pass 
 but phoenix like shall make her live anew 

laughing , “ to night , ” i said to him , “ the park 
 has turned the garden of a symbolist 
 those old great trees that rise above the mist 
 gold with the light of evening , and the dark 
 still water , where the dying sun evokes 
 an echoed glory — here i recognize 
 those ancient gardens mirrored by the eyes 
 of poets that hate the world of common folks 
 like you and me and that thin pious crowd 
 which yonder sings its hymns , so humbly proud 
 of holiness . the garden of escape 
 lies here ; a small green world , and still the bride 
 of quietness , although an imminent rape 
 roars ceaselessly about on every side 

here the whole land doth scorching lye 
 under the glittering armes o ’ th ’ enemy 
 under the hovering stroke o ’ th ’ fates 
 the armies yet both stand ; and fury waites 
 with doubfull steps , upon the warre 
 fresh courage here , the mingled troopes prepare 
 each against other fiercely run 
 and mutually they worke destruction 
 the slaughtered heapes in reeking gore 
 with bloudy covering spread the fields all o ’ re 
 here on safe seas , as joyfull prize 
 is strip ’ d away th ’æ gyptian merchandize 
 whilst the full havens thick beset 
 doe furiously with fierce contention fret 

“ sic semper tyrannis ! ” the assassin cried 
 as lincoln fell . o villain ! who than he 
 more lived to set both slave and tyrant free 
 or so enrapt with plans of freedom died 
 that even thy treacherous deed shall glance aside 
 and do the dead man 's will by land and sea 
 win bloodless battles , and make that to be 
 which to his living mandate was denied 
 peace to that gentle heart ! the peace he sought 
 for all mankind , nor for it dies in vain 
 rest to the uncrowned king , who , toiling , brought 
 his bleeding country through that dreadful reign 
 who , living , earned a world 's revering thought 
 and , dying , leaves his name without a stain 

make me thy lyre , ev'n as the forest is 
 what if my leaves are falling like its own 
 the tumult of thy mighty harmonies 
 will take from both a deep autumnal tone 
 sweet though in sadness . be thou , spirit fierce 
 my spirit ! be thou me , impetuous one 
 drive my dead thoughts over the universe 
 like wither 'd leaves to quicken a new birth 
 and , by the incantation of this verse 
 scatter , as from an unextinguish 'd hearth 
 ashes and sparks , my words among mankind 
 be through my lips to unawaken 'd earth 
 the trumpet of a prophecy ! o , wind 
 if winter comes , can spring be far behind 

a stronger gust catches the cloud and twists 
 a spindle of rifted darkness through its heart 
 a gash in the damp grey , which , thrust apart 
 reveals black depths a moment . then the mists 
 shut down again ; a white uneasy sea 
 heaves round the climbers and beneath their feet 
 he strains on upwards through the wind and sleet 
 poised , or swift moving , or laboriously 
 lifting his weight . and if he should let go 
 what would he find down there , down there below 
 the curtain of the mist ? what would he find 
 beyond the dim and stifling now and here 
 beneath the unsettled turmoil of his mind 
 oh , there were nameless depths : he shrank with fear 

fair star of evening , splendour of the west 
 star of my country !— on the horizon 's brink 
 thou hangest , stooping , as might seem , to sink 
 on england 's bosom ; yet well pleased to rest 
 meanwhile , and be to her a glorious crest 
 conspicuous to the nations . thou , i think 
 should'st be my country 's emblem ; and should'st wink 
 bright star ! with laughter on her banners , drest 
 in thy fresh beauty . there ! that dusky spot 
 beneath thee , that is england ; there she lies 
 blessings be on you both ! one hope , one lot 
 one life , one glory !— i , with many a fear 
 for my dear country , many heartfelt sighs 
 among men who do not love her , linger here 

my weary life , that lives unsatisfied 
 on the foiled off brink of being e ’ er but this 
 to whom the power to will hath been denied 
 and the will to renounce doth also miss 
 my sated life , with having nothing sated 
 in the motion of moving pois è d aye 
 within its dreams from its own dreams abated 
 this life let the gods change or take away 
 for this endless succession of empty hours 
 like deserts after deserts , voidly one 
 doth undermine the very dreaming powers 
 and dull even thought ’ s active inaction 
 tainting with fore unwilled will the dreamed act 
 twice thus removed from the unobtained fact 

well , as soon as a few weeks was over and gone 
 the terrible day iv the thrial kem on 
 there was sich a crowd there was scarce room to stand 
 the sodgers on guard , the dhragoons sword in hand 
 an ’ the court house so full that the people were bothered 
 attorneys an ’ criers were just upon smothered 
 an ’ counsellers almost gev over for dead 
 the jury sat up in their box overhead 
 an ’ the judge on the bench so detarmined an ’ big 
 with his gown on his back , and an illigent wig 
 then silence was called , and the minute ‘ twas said 
 the court was as still as the heart of the dead 
 an ’ they heard but the turn of a key in a lock 
 an ’ shamus o'brien kem into the dock 

at last , beloved nature ! i have met 
 thee face to face upon thy breezy hills 
 and boldly , where thy inmost bowers are set 
 gazed on thee naked in thy mountain rills 
 when first i felt thy breath upon my brow 
 tears of strange ecstasy gushed out like rain 
 and with a longing , passionate as vain 
 i strove to clasp thee . but , i know not how 
 always before me didst thou seem to glide 
 and often from one sunny mountain side 
 upon the next bright peak i saw thee kneel 
 and heard thy voice upon the billowy blast 
 but , climbing , only reached that shrine to feel 
 the shadow of a presence which had passed 

but passing this , as from our tale apart 
 dame partlet was the sovereign of his heart 
 ardent in love , outrageous in his play 
 he feather 'd her a hundred times a day 
 and she , that was not only passing fair 
 but was with all discreet , and debonair 
 resolved the passive doctrine to fulfil 
 though loth ; and let him work his wicked will 
 at board and bed was affable and kind 
 according as their marriage vow did bind 
 and as the church 's precept had enjoin 'd 
 even since she was a se'ennight old , they say 
 was chaste and humble to her dying day 
 nor chick nor hen was known to disobey 

the hero turn 'd to greet the novel sight 
 when three far splendors , yet confusedly bright 
 rose like a constellation ; till more near 
 distinctly mark 'd their different sites appear 
 diverging still , beneath their roofs of gold 
 three cities gay their mural towers unfold 
 so , led by visions of his guiding god 
 the seer of patmos o'er the welkin trod 
 saw the new heaven its flamy cope unbend 
 and walls and gates and spiry domes descend 
 his well known sacred city grows , and gains 
 her new built towers , her renovated fanes 
 with golden skies and suns and rainbows crown 'd 
 jerusalem looks forth and lights the world around 

once more britannia sheathes her conqu'ring sword 
 and peace returns , by victory restored 
 peace , that erewhile estranged , ‘ midst long alarms 
 scarce welcomed home , was ravish 'd from our arms 
 what time , fierce bounding from his broken chain 
 gaul 's banish 'd despot re aspired to reign 
 whilst at his call , prompt minions of his breath 
 round his dire throne rush 'd havoc , spoil , and death 
 with wonted pomp his baleful ensign blazed 
 and europe shrunk , and shudder 'd as she gazed 
 insulted liberty her tocsin rung 
 again britannia to the combat sprung 
 star of the nations ! her auspicious form 
 led on their march , and foremost braved the storm 

by this the widow had unbarr 'd the door 
 and chanticleer went strutting out before 
 with royal courage , and with heart so light 
 as show 'd he scorned the visions of the night 
 now roaming in the yard , he spurn 'd the ground 
 and gave to partlet the first grain he found 
 then often feather 'd her with wanton play 
 and trod her twenty times ere prime of day 
 and took by turns , and gave , so much delight 
 her sisters pined with envy at the sight 
 he chuck 'd again , when other corns he found 
 and scarcely deign 'd to set a foot to ground 
 but swagger 'd like a lord about his hall 
 and his seven wives came running at his call 

when i have borne in memory what has tamed 
 great nations , how ennobling thoughts depart 
 when men change swords for ledgers , and desert 
 the student 's bower for gold , some fears unnamed 
 i had , my country !— am i to be blamed 
 but when i think of thee , and what thou art 
 verily , in the bottom of my heart 
 of those unfilial fears i am ashamed 
 but dearly must we prize thee ; we who find 
 in thee a bulwark for the cause of men 
 and i by my affection was beguiled 
 what wonder if a poet now and then 
 among the many movements of his mind 
 felt for thee as a lover or a child 

edith ( rising and breaking into a kind of chant 
 truly we do but grope here in the dark 
 near the partition wall of life and death 
 at every moment dreading or desiring 
 to lay our hands upon the unseen door 
 let us , then , labor for an inward stillness 
 an inward stillness and an inward healing 
 that perfect silence where the lips and heart 
 are still , and we no longer entertain 
 our own imperfect thoughts and vain opinions 
 but god alone speaks in us , and we wait 
 in singleness of heart , that we may know 
 his will , and in the silence of our spirits 
 that we may do his will , and do that only 

so , without overt breach , we fall apart 
 tacitly sunder — neither you nor i 
 conscious of one intelligible why 
 and both , from severance , winning equal smart 
 so , with resigned and acquiescent heart 
 whene'er your name on some chance lip may lie 
 i seem to see an alien shade pass by 
 a spirit wherein i have no lot or part 
 thus may a captive , in some fortress grim 
 from casual speech betwixt his warders , learn 
 that june on her triumphant progress goes 
 through arched and bannered woodlands ; while for him 
 she is a legend emptied of concern 
 and idle is the rumour of the rose 

i lift my heavy heart up solemnly 
 as once electra her sepulchral urn 
 and , looking in thine eyes , i over turn 
 the ashes at thy feet . behold and see 
 what a great heap of grief lay hid in me 
 and how the red wild sparkles dimly burn 
 through the ashen greyness . if thy foot in scorn 
 could tread them out to darkness utterly 
 it might be well perhaps . but if instead 
 thou wait beside me for the wind to blow 
 the grey dust up , . . . those laurels on thine head 
 o my beloved , will not shield thee so 
 that none of all the fires shall scorch and shred 
 the hair beneath . stand further off then ! go 

sweet soul , which , in the april of thy years 
 for to enrich the heaven mad'st poor this round 
 and now , with flaming rays of glory crown 'd 
 most blest abides above the sphere of spheres 
 if heavenly laws , alas ! have not thee bound 
 from looking to this globe that all upbears 
 if ruth and pity there above be found 
 oh , deign to lend a look unto these tears 
 do not disdain , dear ghost , this sacrifice 
 and though i raise not pillars to thy praise 
 my offerings take , let this for me suffice 
 my heart a living pyramid i raise 
 and whilst kings ’ tombs with laurels flourish green 
 thine shall with myrtles and these flowers be seen 

the spark concealed himself ; each charm admired 
 now this , now that , now t'other feature fired 
 a hundred beauties caught his eager sight 
 and while his bosom felt supreme delight 
 he turned his thoughts advantages to take 
 and of the maiden 's error something make 
 assumed the character , and dress ; and air 
 that should a wat'ry deity declare 
 within the gliding flood his vestments dipt 
 a crown of rushes on his head he slipt 
 aquatick herbs and plants around he twined 
 then mercury intreated to be kind 
 and cupid too , the wily god of hearts 
 how could the innocent resist these arts 

the world was in its day of peril dark 
 wont to believe the dotage of fond love 
 from the fair cyprian deity , who rolls 
 in her third epicycle , shed on men 
 by stream of potent radiance : therefore they 
 of elder time , in their old error blind 
 not her alone with sacrifice ador 'd 
 and invocation , but like honours paid 
 to cupid and dione , deem 'd of them 
 her mother , and her son , him whom they feign 'd 
 to sit in dido 's bosom : and from her 
 whom i have sung preluding , borrow 'd they 
 the appellation of that star , which views 
 now obvious and now averse , the sun 

to gasperin 's so often went our wight 
 the wife at length became his sole delight 
 whose youth and beauty were by all confessed 
 but , ‘ midst these charms , such av'rice she possessed 
 the warmest love was checked — a thing not rare 
 in modern times at least , among the fair 
 ‘ tis true , as i 've already said , with such 
 sighs naught avail , and promises not much 
 without a purse , who wishes should express 
 would vainly hope to gain a soft caress 
 the god of love no other charm employs 
 then cards , and dress , and pleasure 's cheering joys 
 from whose gay shops more cuckolds we behold 
 than heroes sallied from troy 's horse of old 

to stab my youth with desperate knives , to wear 
 this paltry age 's gaudy livery 
 to let each base hand filch my treasury 
 to mesh my soul within a woman 's hair 
 and be mere fortune 's lackeyed groom ,— i swear 
 i love it not ! these things are less to me 
 than the thin foam that frets upon the sea 
 less than the thistledown of summer air 
 which hath no seed : better to stand aloof 
 far from these slanderous fools who mock my life 
 knowing me not , better the lowliest roof 
 fit for the meanest hind to sojourn in 
 than to go back to that hoarse cave of strife 
 where my white soul first kissed the mouth of sin 

when my love swears that she is made of truth 
 i do believe her , though i know she lies 
 that she might think me some untutor 'd youth 
 unskilful in the world 's false forgeries 
 thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young 
 although i know my years be past the best 
 i smiling credit her false speaking tongue 
 outfacing faults in love with love 's ill rest 
 but wherefore says my love that she is young 
 and wherefore say not i that i am old 
 o , love 's best habit is a soothing tongue 
 and age , in love , loves not to have years told 
 therefore , i 'll lie with love , and love with me 
 since that our faults in love thus smother 'd be 

the more i 've viewed this world the more i 've found 
 that , filled as ‘ tis with scenes and creatures rare 
 fancy commands within her own bright round 
 a world of scenes and creatures far more fair 
 nor is it that her power can call up there 
 a single charm , that 's not from nature won 
 no more than rainbows in their pride can wear 
 a single hue unborrowed from the sun 
 but ‘ tis the mental medium it shines thro 
 that lends to beauty all its charm and hue 
 as the same light that o'er the level lake 
 one dull monotony of lustre flings 
 will , entering in the rounded raindrop , make 
 colors as gay as those on peris ’ wings 

“ deem not , devoid of elegance , the sage 
 by fancy 's genuine feelings unbeguil 'd 
 of painful pedantry the poring child 
 who turns of these proud domes the historic page 
 now sunk by time , and henry 's fiercer rage 
 think'st thou the warbling muses never smil 'd 
 on his lone hours ? ingenuous views engage 
 his thoughts , on themes unclassic falsely styl 'd 
 intent . while cloister 'd piety displays 
 her mouldering roll , the piercing eye explores 
 new manners , and the pomp of elder days 
 whence culls the pensive bard his pictur 'd stores 
 not rough nor barren are the winding ways 
 of hoar antiquity , but strewn with flowers 

the wise world saith i not unlock 'd my heart 
 when i of thee and thy dear love did write 
 and would each word of mine to false convert 
 doing my simple sense a double spite 
 it saith thou wert but shadow born of nought 
 but vain creation of an apish rhyme 
 while , fashion 's fool , my strain 'd invention sought 
 to better them who best did please the time 
 but wherefore say they so , and do dear wrong 
 to thee , whose worth was my sole argument 
 to me , whose verse ‘ twas truth alone made strong 
 by that the breast must feel , not brain invent 
 they who this doubt never such beauty knew 
 nor what to poet love alone can do 

as jove 's increase , who from his brain was born 
 whom arms and arts did equally adorn 
 free of the breast was bred , whose milky taste 
 minerva 's name to venus had debased 
 so this imperial babe rejects the food 
 that mixes monarch 's with plebeian blood 
 food that his inborn courage might control 
 extinguish all the father in his soul 
 and , for his estian race , and saxon strain 
 might reproduce some second richard 's reign 
 mildness he shares from both his parents ’ blood 
 but kings too tame are despicably good 
 be this the mixture of this regal child 
 by nature manly , but by virtue mild 

at ephesus , in former times , once shone 
 a fair , whose charms would dignify a throne 
 and , if to publick rumour credit ‘ s due 
 celestial bliss her husband with her knew 
 naught else was talked of but her beauteous face 
 and chastity that adds the highest grace 
 from ev'ry quarter numbers flocked to see 
 this belle , regarded as from errors free 
 the honour of her sex , and country too 
 as such , old mothers held her up to view 
 and wished their offspring 's wives like her to act 
 the sons desired the very same in fact 
 from her , beyond a doubt , our prudes descend 
 an ancient , celebrated house , depend 

rudely thou wrongest my deare harts desire 
 in finding fault with her too portly pride 
 the thing which i doo most in her admire 
 is of the world unworthy most envide 
 for in those lofty lookes is close implide 
 scorn of base things , and sdeigne of foul dishonor 
 thretning rash eies which gaze on her so wide 
 that loosely they ne dare to looke upon her 
 such pride is praise , such portlinesse is honor 
 that boldned innocence beares in hir eies 
 and her faire countenaunce , like a goodly banner 
 spreds in defiaunce of all enemies 
 was never in this world ought worthy tride 
 without some spark of such self pleasing pride 

i feel myself endangered beyond reason 
 my death already ‘ twixt the cup and lip 
 because my proud desire through curs è d treason 
 would make my hopes mount heaven , which cannot skip 
 my fancy still requireth at my hands 
 such things as are not , cannot , may not be 
 and my desire although my power withstands 
 will give me wings , who never yet could flee 
 what then remains except my maim è d soul 
 extort compassion from love flying age 
 or if naught else their fury may control 
 to call on death that quells affection 's rage 
 which death shall dwell with me and never fly 
 since vain desire seeks that hope doth deny 

the heart you hold too small and local thing 
 such spacious terms of edifice to bear 
 and yet , since poesy first shook out her wing 
 the mighty love has been impalaced there 
 that has she given him as his wide demesne 
 and for his sceptre ample empery 
 against its door to knock has beauty been 
 content ; it has its purple canopy 
 a dais for the sovereign lady spread 
 of many a lover , who the heaven would think 
 too low an awning for her sacred head 
 the world , from star to sea , cast down its brink 
 yet shall that chasm , till he who these did build 
 an awful curtius make him , yawn unfilled 

autumn in oregon — i 'll never see 
 those hills again , a blur of blue and rain 
 across the old willamette . i 'll not stir 
 a pheasant as i walk , and hear it whirr 
 above my head , an indolent , trusting thing 
 when all this silly dream is finished here 
 the fellows will go home to where there fall 
 rose petals over every street , and all 
 the year is like a friendly festival 
 but i shall never watch those hedges drip 
 color , not see the tall spar of a ship 
 in our old harbor . — they say that i am dying 
 perhaps that 's why it all comes back again 
 autumn in oregon and pheasants flying 

the winds have grown articulate in thee 
 and voiced again the wail of ancient woe 
 that smote upon the winds of long ago 
 the cries of trojan women as they flee 
 the quivering moan of pale andromache 
 now lifted loud with pain and now brought low 
 it is the soul of sorrow that we know 
 as in a shell the soul of all the sea 
 so sometimes in the compass of a song 
 unknown to him who sings , thro ’ lips that live 
 the voiceless dead of long forgotten lands 
 proclaim to us their heaviness and wrong 
 in sweeping sadness of the winds that give 
 thy strings no rest from weariless wild hands 

because a steadfast flame of clear intent 
 gave force and beauty to full actioned life 
 because his way was one of firm ascent 
 whose stepping stones were hewn of change and strife 
 because as husband loveth noble wife 
 he loved fair truth ; because the thing he meant 
 to do , that thing he did , nor paused , nor bent 
 in face of poor and pale conclusions ; yea 
 because of this , how fares the leader dead 
 what kind of mourners weep for him to day 
 what golden shroud is at his funeral spread 
 upon his brow what leaves of laurel , say 
 about his breast is tied a sackcloth grey 
 and knots of thorns deface his lordly head 

o king , whose greatness none can comprehend 
 whose boundless goodness doth to all extend 
 light of all beauty ! ocean without ground 
 that standing flowest , giving dost abound 
 rich palace , and indweller ever blest 
 never not working , ever yet in rest 
 what wit cannot conceive , words say of thee 
 here , where , as in a mirror , we but see 
 shadows of shadows , atoms of thy might 
 still owly eyed while staring on thy light 
 grant that , released from this earthly jail 
 and freed of clouds which here our knowledge veil 
 in heaven 's high temples , where thy praises ring 
 i may in sweeter notes hear angels sing 

weary with toil , i haste me to my bed 
 the dear respose for limbs with travel tired 
 but then begins a journey in my head 
 to work my mind , when body 's work 's expired 
 for then my thoughts ( from far where i abide 
 intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee 
 and keep my drooping eyelids open wide 
 looking on darkness which the blind do see 
 save that my soul 's imaginary sight 
 presents thy shadow to my sightless view 
 which like a jewel ( hung in ghastly night 
 makes black night beauteous , and her old face new 
 lo thus by day my limbs , by night my mind 
 for thee , and for my self , no quiet find 

faire proud ! now tell me , why should faire be proud 
 sith all worlds glorie is but drosse uncleane 
 and in the shade of death it selfe shall shroud 
 however now thereof ye little weene 
 that goodly idoll , now so gay beseene 
 shall doffe her fleshes borrowd fayre attyre 
 and be forgot as it had never beene 
 that many now much worship and admire 
 ne any then shall after it inquire 
 ne any mention shall thereof remaine 
 but what this verse , that never shall expyre 
 shall to you purchas with her thankles pain 
 faire ! be no lenger proud of that shall perish 
 but that which shall you make immortall cherish 

let not my love be called idolatry 
 nor my beloved as an idol show 
 since all alike my songs and praises be 
 to one , of one , still such , and ever so 
 kind is my love to day , to morrow kind 
 still constant in a wondrous excellence 
 therefore my verse to constancy confined 
 one thing expressing , leaves out difference 
 fair , kind , and true , is all my argument 
 fair , kind , and true , varying to other words 
 and in this change is my invention spent 
 three themes in one , which wondrous scope affords 
 fair , kind , and true , have often lived alone 
 which three till now , never kept seat in one 

the saint who shuts outside his placid soul 
 all touch of sense , letting no contact through 
 whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows 
 whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn 
 equal and slow through nostrils still and close 
 that one with organs , heart , and mind constrained 
 bent on deliverance , having put away 
 passion , and fear , and rage ;— hath , even now 
 obtained deliverance , ever and ever freed 
 yea ! for he knows me who am he that heeds 
 the sacrifice and worship , god revealed 
 and he who heeds not , being lord of worlds 
 lover of all that lives , god unrevealed 
 wherein who will shall find surety and shield 

then awful sights began to be reveal 'd 
 which death 's dark dungeons had so long conceal 'd 
 each grave its doomsday prisoner resign 'd 
 bursting in noises like a hollow wind 
 and spirits , mingling with the living then 
 thrill 'd fearful voices with the cries of men 
 all flying furious , grinning deep despair 
 shaped dismal shadows on the troubled air 
 red lightning shot its flashes as they came 
 and passing clouds seem 'd kindling into flame 
 and strong and stronger came the sulphury smell 
 with demons following in the breath of hell 
 laughing in mockery as the doom 'd complain 'd 
 losing their pains in seeing others pain 'd 

no sooner youth throws off his infant plays 
 the harmless pastime of his happier days 
 but past a child , is still in judgement so 
 and studies first what he is not to know 
 pleasure and sence his easie soul entice 
 spurr 'd forward by his native love to vice 
 a mistress now his fancy entertains 
 and youthful vigour boils within his brains 
 the poor lost maid he do 's with oaths intice 
 and loads his soul with twenty thousand lyes 
 promises marriage , love , a hundred things 
 till both himself and her , he to destruction brings 
 at length he finds his falsity repaid 
 and draws the curse of heaven on his head 

he plays with other boys when work is done 
 but feels too clumsy and too stiff to run 
 yet where there 's mischief he can find a way 
 the first to join and last [ to run ] away 
 what 's said or done he never hears or minds 
 but gets his pence for all the eggs he finds 
 he thinks his master 's horses far the best 
 and always labours longer than the rest 
 in frost and cold though lame he 's forced to go 
 the call 's more urgent when he journeys slow 
 in surly speed he helps the maids by force 
 and feeds the cows and hallos till he 's hoarse 
 and when he 's lame they only jest and play 
 and bid him throw his kiby heels away 

fire out of heaven , a flower of perfect fire 
 that where the roots of life are had its root 
 and where the fruits of time are brought forth fruit 
 a faith made flesh , a visible desire 
 that heard the yet unbreathing years respire 
 and speech break forth of centuries that sit mute 
 beyond all feebler footprint of pursuit 
 that touched the highest of hope , and went up higher 
 a heart love wounded whereto love was law 
 a soul reproachless without fear or flaw 
 a shining spirit without shadow of shame 
 a memory made of all men 's love and awe 
 being disembodied , so thou be the same 
 what need , o soul , to sign thee with thy name 

not so with thee ; for some indeed there are 
 who would behold the truth and then return 
 to pine among the semblances — but i 
 divined in thee the questing foot that never 
 revisits the cold hearth of yesterday 
 or calls achievement home . i from afar 
 beheld thee fashioned for one hour 's high use 
 nor meant to slake oblivion drop by drop 
 long , long hadst thou inhabited my dreams 
 surprising me as harts surprise a pool 
 stealing to drink at midnight ; i divined 
 thee rash to reach the heart of life , and lie 
 bosom to bosom in occasion 's arms 
 and said : because i love thee thou shalt die 

when satisfied the smart gallant appeared 
 and anxiously to putting off adhered 
 pretending that the wind and tide would fail 
 the galleys sometimes were unfit to sail 
 repairs required ; then further heard the news 
 that certain pirates had unpleasant views 
 to fall upon the escort they 'd contrived 
 at length , a pirate suddenly arrived 
 surprized the party left upon the shore 
 destroyed the whole ; then sought the house for more 
 and scaled the walls while darkness spread around 
 the pirate was grifonio 's second found 
 who , in a trice , the noble mansion took 
 and joy gave place to grief in ev'ry look 

love and my love did range the forest wild 
 mounted alike , upon swift coursers both 
 love her encountered , though he was a child 
 “ let 's strive , ” saith he , whereat my love was wroth 
 and scorned the boy , and checked him with a smile 
 “ i mounted am , and arm è d with my spear 
 thou art too weak , thyself do not beguile 
 i could thee conquer if i naked were 
 with this love wept , and then my love replied 
 “ kiss me , sweet boy , so weep my boy no more 
 thus did my love , and then her force she tried 
 love was made ice , that fire was before 
 a kiss of hers , as i , poor soul , do prove 
 can make the hottest freeze and coldest love 

eastward was built a gate of marble white 
 the like adorned the western opposite 
 a nobler object than this fabric was 
 rome never saw , nor of so vast a space 
 for , rich with spoils of many a conquered land 
 all arts and artists theseus could command 
 who sold for hire , or wrought for better fame 
 the master painters and the carvers came 
 so rose within the compass of the year 
 an age 's work , a glorious theatre 
 then o'er its eastern gate was raised above 
 a temple , sacred to the queen of love 
 an altar stood below ; on either hand 
 a priest with roses crowned , who held a myrtle wand 

woe for thee , babylon !— thy men of might 
 shall fall unhonoured in the sanguine fight 
 like the chased roe thy hosts disordered fly 
 and those who turn to strive but turn to die 
 thy young men tremble and thy maids grow pale 
 and swell with frantic grief thy funeral wail 
 they kneel for mercy , but they sue in vain 
 their beauty withers on the gore dyed plain 
 with fathers , lovers , brothers , meet their doom 
 and ‘ mid thy blackened ruins find a tomb 
 of fear unconscious , in soft slumbers blest 
 the infant dies upon its mother 's breast 
 unpitied e'en by her — the hand that gave 
 the blow has sent the parent to the grave 

so reuben 's life in full leaf stood , its fruit 
 hidden in a green expectancy ; but all 
 his days were rounded with ripe consciousness 
 while jerry felt the winter 's whitening blight 
 as when that frosty fern work and those palms 
 of visionary leaf , and trailing vines 
 quaint chased by night winds on the pane , melt off 
 and naked earth , stone stiff , with bristling trees 
 stares in the winter sunlight coldly through 
 but yet he rose , and clothed himself amain 
 with misery , and once more put on life 
 as a stained garment . highly he resolved 
 to make his deedless days henceforward strike 
 pure harmony — a psalm of silences 

“ what ! are th ’ infernal powers moved for me 
 that all the hosts of hell me welcome give 
 and claim me comrade in their revelry 
 abhorrent things , i am not yours , i live 
 i know i live because i think on death 
 i live , dead things , to revel among tombs 
 a ghoul , henceforth i feast on buried joys 
 my soul the burial place , where lie , beneath 
 a fearful night of cries and hellish spumes 
 my lovely youth with jovial convoys 
 hopes , happy eyed , and linked solaces 
 and in the lapse of hateful years they will 
 my guileless joys , my rose hued memories 
 corrupt and rot and turn to venomed ill 

but thou ( since nature bids ) the world resign 
 ‘ tis now thy daughter 's daughter 's time to shine 
 with more address , ( or such as pleases more 
 she runs her female exercises o'er 
 unfurls or closes , raps or turns the fan 
 and smiles , or blushes at the creature man 
 with quicker life , as gilded coaches pass 
 in sideling courtesy she drops the glass 
 with better strength , on visit days she bears 
 to mount her fifty flights of ample stairs 
 her mien , her shape , her temper , eyes and tongue 
 are sure to conquer — for the rogue is young 
 and all that 's madly wild , or oddly gay 
 we call it only pretty fanny 's way 

near one of these small openings where the breeze 
 crept resinous and cool from evergreens 
 behind them , while the sun blazed bright before 
 where with the pine trees ’ vapory depth of hue 
 the whiteness of a spacious tent contrasted 
 beside which , on a staff , the nation 's flag 
 flung out its crimson with protecting pride 
 reclined a wife and husband , looking down 
 less on the glorious lake than on the glory 
 that , through a gauzy veil , played round the head 
 of a reposing infant , golden tressed 
 asleep upon a deer skin at their feet 
 while a huge dog kept watchful guard beyond 
 for there lay little mary merivale 

“ oh ! adrian , my faint heart fain would dwell 
 forever here beneath thy love 's dear spell 
 but ah ! beyond the height where breaks the day 
 there lives a charm that calls my soul away 
 afar the mountains glow in pale , blue mist 
 by fleecy clouds and summer sunshine kissed 
 and see ! beyond them all i long to be 
 beyond this shore , beyond the trackless sea 
 ah ! this is why , dear adrian , we must part 
 although it rends my grieving , restless heart 
 forgive me if to night i 've caused thee pain 
 if grief be thine , forgive me once again 
 farewell ! when from thy life my love is fled 
 henceforth to thee let hilda 's name be dead 

i stood amazed , and saw my licia shine 
 fairer than phoebus , in his brightest pride 
 set forth in colors by a hand divine 
 where naught was wanting but a soul to guide 
 it was a picture , that i could descry 
 yet made with art so as it seemed to live 
 surpassing fair , and yet it had no eye 
 whereof my senses could no reason give 
 with that the painter bid me not to muse 
 “ her eyes are shut , but i deserve no blame 
 for if she saw , in faith , it could not choose 
 but that the work had wholly been a flame 
 then burn me , sweet , with brightness of your eyes 
 that phoenix like from thence i may arise

read here the story of evarra — man 
 maker of gods in lands beyond the sea 
 because the city had no wealth to give 
 because the caravans were spoiled afar 
 because his life was threatened by the king 
 so that all men despised him in the streets 
 he hewed the living rock , with sweat and tears 
 and reared a god against the morning gold 
 a terror in the sunshine , seen afar 
 and worshipped by the king ; but , drunk with pride 
 because the city fawned to bring him back 
 he carved upon the plinth : “ thus gods are made 
 and whoso makes them otherwise shall die 
 and all the people praised him . . . . then he died 

— on all the desolations he hath wrought 
 — on all the passioned hatreds he hath taught 
 — on all thy great hopes he hath brought to nought 
 — man rending man with ruthless bitterness 
 — blasting thine image into nothingness 
 — hounding thy innocents to awful deaths 
 and worse than deaths ! happy the dead , who sped 
 before the torturers their lust had fed 
 — on thy christ crucified afresh each day 
 — on all the horrors of war 's grim red way 
 and ever , in thy solemn midnight skies 
 those myriad , sleepless , vast accusing eyes 
 watching , watching , watching all below 
 and man in all his wilfulness for woe 

march , tho ’ the hours of promise with bright ray 
 may gild thy noons , yet , on wild pinion borne 
 loud winds more often rudely wake thy morn 
 and harshly hymn thy early closing day 
 still the chill 'd earth wears , with her tresses shorn 
 her bleak , grey garb :— yet not for this we mourn 
 nor , as in winter 's more enduring sway 
 with festal viands , and associates gay 
 arm ‘ gainst the skies ;— nor shun the piercing gale 
 but , with blue cheeks , and with disorder 'd hair 
 meet its rough breath ;— and peep for primrose pale 
 or lurking violet , under hedges bare 
 and , thro ’ long evenings , from our lares 
 the thrift of stinted grate , and sullen flame 

that day we brought our beautiful one to lie 
 in the green peace within your gates , he came 
 to give us greeting , boyish and kind and shy 
 and , stricken as we were , we blessed his name 
 yet , like the creature of light that had been ours 
 soon of the sweet earth disinherited 
 he too must join , even with the year 's old flowers 
 the unanswering generations of the dead 
 so stand we friends for you , who stood our friend 
 through him that day ; for now through him you know 
 that though where love was , love is till the end 
 love , turned of death to longing , like a foe 
 strikes : when the ruined heart goes forth to crave 
 mercy of the high , austere , unpitying grave 

god give us men ; a time like this demands 
 strong minds , great hearts , true faith and ready hands 
 men whom the lust of office cannot kill 
 men whom the spoils of office cannot buy 
 men who possess opinions and a will 
 men who have honor ; men who will not lie 
 men who can stand before a demagogue 
 and brave his treacherous flatteries without winking 
 tall men , sun crowned , who live above the fog 
 in public duty and in private thinking 
 for while the rabble , with its thumb worn creeds 
 its large professions , and its little deeds 
 mingle in selfish strife — lo ! freedom weeps 
 wrong rules the land , and waiting justice sleeps 

not love of you is most that i can bring 
 since what i am to love you is the test 
 and should i love you more than any thing 
 you would but be of idle love possessed 
 a mere love wandering in appetite 
 counting your glories and yet bringing none 
 finding in you occasions of delight 
 a thief of payment for no service done 
 but when of labouring life i make a song 
 and bring it you , as that were my reward 
 to let what most is me to you belong 
 then do i come of high possessions lord 
 and loving life more than my love of you 
 i give you love more excellently true 

umbrageous woods , green dells , and mountains high 
 and bright cascades , and wide cerulean seas 
 slumbering , or snow wreathed by the freshening breeze 
 and isles like motionless clouds upon the sky 
 in silent summer noons , late charmed mine eye 
 until my soul was stirred like wind touched trees 
 and passionate love and speechless ecstasies 
 up raised the thoughts in spiritual depths that lie 
 fair scenes , ye haunt me still ! yet i behold 
 this sultry city on the level shore 
 not all unmoved ; for here our fathers bold 
 won proud historic names in days of yore 
 and here are generous hearts that ne'er grow cold 
 and many a friendly hand and open door 

“ even in a palace , life may be led well 
 so spoke the imperial sage , purest of men 
 marcus aurelius . but the stifling den 
 of common life , where , crowded up pell mell 
 our freedom for a little bread we sell 
 and drudge under some foolish master 's ken 
 who rates us if we peer outside our pen 
 matched with a palace , is not this a hell 
 “ even in a palace ! ” on his truth sincere 
 who spoke these words no shadow ever came 
 and when my ill schooled spirit is aflame 
 some nobler , ampler stage of life to win 
 i 'll stop and say : “ there were no succor here 
 the aids to noble life are all within 

th ’ expense of spirit in a waste of shame 
 is lust in action , and till action , lust 
 is perjured , murd'rous , bloody full of blame 
 savage , extreme , rude , cruel , not to trust 
 enjoyed no sooner but despised straight 
 past reason hunted , and no sooner had 
 past reason hated as a swallowed bait 
 on purpose laid to make the taker mad 
 mad in pursuit and in possession so 
 had , having , and in quest , to have extreme 
 a bliss in proof and proved , a very woe 
 before a joy proposed behind a dream 
 all this the world well knows yet none knows well 
 to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell 

low in the west , a banner floating wide 
 of god 's own colors hangs in dreamy pride 
 a wealth of purple stains and gleams of gold 
 a crimson splendor o'er each waving fold 
 a heap of gold — a rim of amethyst 
 a hanging cloud by glancing sunbeams kissed 
 afar upon the tinted , azure skies 
 a tiny cloud of rosy color lies 
 a coral on a velvet robe of blue 
 a warm , bright wave upon the skies ’ pale hue 
 oh ! such the sunset sky of italy 
 the land of dreams , of love and melody 
 the country of the passions and the heart 
 the mother of th ’ ideal and of art 

cromwell , our chief of men , who through a cloud 
 not of war only , but detractions rude 
 guided by faith and matchless fortitude 
 to peace and truth thy glorious way hast ploughed 
 and on the neck of crown è d fortune proud 
 hast reared god 's trophies , and his work pursued 
 while darwen stream , with blood of scots imbrued 
 and dunbar field , resounds thy praises loud 
 and worcester 's laureate wreath : yet much remains 
 to conquer still ; peace hath her victories 
 no less renowned than war : new foes arise 
 threatening to bind our souls with secular chains 
 help us to save free conscience from the paw 
 of hireling wolves whose gospel is their maw 

the church bells tolled , the chant of monks drew near 
 loud trumpets stammered forth their notes of fear 
 a line of torches smoked along the street 
 there was a stir , a rush , a tramp of feet 
 and , with its banners floating in the air 
 slowly the long procession crossed the square 
 and , to the statues of the prophets bound 
 the victims stood , with fagots piled around 
 then all the air a blast of trumpets shook 
 and louder sang the monks with bell and book 
 and the hidalgo , lofty , stern , and proud 
 lifted his torch , and , bursting through the crowd 
 lighted in haste the fagots , and then fled 
 lest those imploring eyes should strike him dead 

i am not one who much or oft delight 
 to season my fireside with personal talk 
 about friends , who live within an easy walk 
 or neighbours , daily , weekly , in my sight 
 and , for my chance acquaintance , ladies bright 
 sons , mothers , maidens withering on the stalk 
 these all wear out of me , like forms , with chalk 
 painted on rich men 's floors , for one feast night 
 better than such discourse doth silence long 
 long , barren silence , square with my desire 
 to sit without emotion , hope , or aim 
 by my half kitchen my half parlour fire 
 and listen to the flapping of the flame 
 or kettle , whispering it 's faint undersong 

from beauteous windsor 's high and storied halls 
 where edward 's chiefs start from the glowing walls 
 to my low cot , from ivory beds of state 
 pleased i return , unenvious of the great 
 so the bee ranges o'er the varied scenes 
 of corn , of heaths , of fallows , and of greens 
 pervades the thicket , soars above the hill 
 or murmurs to the meadow 's murmuring rill 
 now haunts old hollowed oaks , deserted cells 
 now seeks the low vale lily 's silver bells 
 sips the warm fragrance of the greenhouse bowers 
 and tastes the myrtle and the citron flowers 
 at length returning to the wonted comb 
 prefers to all his little straw built home 

the lady of the leaf ordain 'd a feast 
 and made the lady of the flower her guest 
 when , lo ! a bower ascended on the plain 
 with sudden seats ordain 'd , and large for either train 
 this bower was near my pleasant arbour placed 
 that i could hear and see whatever pass 'd 
 the ladies sat with each a knight between 
 distinguish 'd by their colours , white and green 
 the vanquish 'd party with the victors join 'd 
 nor wanted sweet discourse , the banquet of the mind 
 meantime the minstrels play 'd on either side 
 vain of their art , and for the mastery vied 
 the sweet contention lasted for an hour 
 and reach 'd my secret arbour from the bower 

but love whilst that thou mayst be loved again 
 now whilst thy may hath filled thy lap with flowers 
 now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain 
 now use thy summer smiles , ere winter lowers 
 and whilst thou spread'st unto the rising sun 
 the fairest flower that ever saw the light 
 now joy thy time before thy sweet be done 
 and , delia , think thy morning must have night 
 and that thy brightness sets at length to west 
 when thou wilt close up that which now thou showest 
 and think the same becomes thy fading best 
 which then shall most inveil and shadow most 
 men do not weigh the stalk for that it was 
 when once they find her flower , her glory pass 

seven sweet singing birds up in a tree 
 seven swift sailing ships white upon the sea 
 seven bright weather cocks shining in the sun 
 seven slim race horses ready for a run 
 seven gold butterflies , flitting overhead 
 seven red roses blowing in a garden bed 
 seven white lilies , with honey bees inside them 
 seven round rainbows with clouds to divide them 
 seven pretty little girls with sugar on their lips 
 seven witty little boys , whom everybody tips 
 seven nice fathers , to call little maids joys 
 seven nice mothers , to kiss the little boys 
 seven nights running i dreamt it all plain 
 with bread and jam for supper i could dream it all again 

such as the berecynthian goddesse bright

 renowm 'd for fruite of famous progenie 
 whose greatnes by the greatnes of none other 
 but by her selfe , her equall match could see 
 rome onely might to rome compared bee 
 and onely rome could make great rome to tremble

 that other earthlie power should not resemble 
 her that did match the whole earths puissaunce 
 and did her courage to the heavens advaunce 

the hope of truth grows stronger , day by day 
 i hear the soul of man around me waking 
 like a great sea , its frozen fetters breaking 
 and flinging up to heaven its sunlit spray 
 tossing huge continents in scornful play 
 and crushing them , with din of grinding thunder 
 that makes old emptinesses stare in wonder 
 the memory of a glory passed away 
 lingers in every heart , as , in the shell 
 resounds the bygone freedom of the sea 
 and every hour new signs of promise tell 
 that the great soul shall once again be free 
 for high , and yet more high , the murmurs swell 
 of inward strife for truth and liberty 

vain transitory splendors ! could not all 
 reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall 
 obscure it sinks , nor shall it more impart 
 an hour 's importance to the poor man 's heart 
 thither no more the peasant shall repair 
 to sweet oblivion of his daily care 
 no more the farmer 's news , the barber 's tale 
 no more the woodman 's ballad shall prevail 
 no more the smith his dusky brow shall clear 
 relax his ponderous strength , and lean to hear 
 the host himself no longer shall be found 
 careful to see the mantling bliss go round 
 nor the coy maid , half willing to be pressed 
 shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest 

stand , thou great bulwark of man 's liberty 
 thou rock of shelter , rising from the wave 
 sole refuge to the overwearied brave 
 who planned , arose , and battled to be free 
 fell , undeterred , then sadly turned to thee 
 saved the free spirit from their country 's grave 
 to rise again , and animate the slave 
 when god shall ripen all things . britons , ye 
 who guard the sacred outpost , not in vain 
 hold your proud peril ! freemen undefiled 
 keep watch and ward ! let battlements be piled 
 around your cliffs ; fleets marshalled , till the main

 through force or fraud , look westward to your child

 from all his fellows , lived alone , and came 
 to learn black magic , and to hate his kind

i had rather cut man 's purpose deeper than 
 achieving it be crowned as conqueror 
 to will divinely is to accomplish more 
 than a mere deed : it fills anew the wan 
 aspect of life with blood ; it draws upon 
 sources beyond the common reach and lore 
 of mortals , to replenish at its core 
 the god impassioned energy of man 
 and herewith all the worlds of deed and thought 
 quicken again with meaning — pulse and thrill 
 with deity — that had forgot his touch

 as this invisible wedding of the will 
 with life — yea , though it seem to accomplish naught

 the time was ripe for god 's avenging fires

 had brought the fair , fine face of rome to shame 
 and made her one with sins beyond a name 
 that queenly daughter of imperial sires 
 the blood of elders like the blood of sheep 
 was dashed across the circus . once while din 
 and dust and lightnings , and a draggled heap 
 of beast slain men made lords with laughter leap 
 night fell , with rain . the earth , so sick of sin

dear fellow traveller ! here we are once more 
 the cock that crows , the smoke that curls , that sound 
 of bells , those boys that in yon meadow ground 
 in white sleev 'd shirts are playing by the score 
 and even this little river 's gentle roar 
 all , all are english . oft have i look 'd round 
 with joy in kent 's green vales ; but never found 
 myself so satisfied in heart before 
 europe is yet in bonds ; but let that pass 
 thought for another moment . thou art free 
 my country ! and ‘ tis joy enough and pride 
 for one hour 's perfect bliss , to tread the grass 
 of england once again , and hear and see 
 with such a dear companion at my side 

“ so saying , he strode on — kunti 's strong son 
 and bh í ma , and arjuna followed him 
 and nakula , and the hound ; leaving behind 
 sahadev in the sands . but nakula 
 weakened and grieved to see sahadev fall 
 his loved twin brother — lagged and stayed ; and next 
 prone on his face he fell , that noble face 
 which had no match for beauty in the land 
 glorious and godlike nakula ! then sighed 
 bh í ma anew : ‘ brother and lord ! the man 
 who never erred from virtue , never broke 
 our fellowship , and never in the world 
 was matched for goodly perfectness of form 
 or gracious feature ,— nakula has fallen 

then still abiding in that ensign rang 'd 
 wherewith the romans over awed the world 
 those burning splendours of the holy spirit 
 took up the strain ; and thus it spake again 
 “ none ever hath ascended to this realm 
 who hath not a believer been in christ 
 either before or after the blest limbs 
 were nail 'd upon the wood . but lo ! of those 
 who call ‘ christ , christ , ’ there shall be many found 
 in judgment , further off from him by far 
 than such , to whom his name was never known 
 christians like these the ethiop shall condemn 
 when that the two assemblages shall part 
 one rich eternally , the other poor 

are these wild thoughts , thus fettered in my rhymes 
 indeed the product of my heart and brain 
 how strange that on my ear the rhythmic strain 
 falls like faint memories of far off times 
 when did i feel the sorrow , act the part 
 which i have striv'n to shadow forth in song 
 in what dead century swept that mingled throng 
 of mighty pains and pleasures through my heart 
 not in the yesterdays of that still life 
 which i have passed so free and far from strife 
 but somewhere in this weary world i know 
 in some strange land , beneath some orient clime 
 i saw or shared a martyrdom sublime 
 and felt a deeper grief than any later woe 

then i again inquir 'd : “ where flow the streams 
 of phlegethon and lethe ? for of one 
 thou tell'st not , and the other of that shower 
 thou say'st , is form 'd . ” he answer thus return 'd 
 “ doubtless thy questions all well pleas 'd i hear 
 yet the red seething wave might have resolv 'd 
 one thou proposest . lethe thou shalt see 
 but not within this hollow , in the place 
 whither to lave themselves the spirits go 
 whose blame hath been by penitence remov 'd 
 he added : “ time is now we quit the wood 
 look thou my steps pursue : the margins give 
 safe passage , unimpeded by the flames 
 for over them all vapour is extinct 

guido , i would that lapo , thou , and i 
 led by some strong enchantment , might ascend 
 a magic ship , whose charmed sails should fly 
 with winds at will where'er our thoughts might wend 
 so that no change , nor any evil chance 
 should mar our joyous voyage ; but it might be 
 that even satiety should still enhance 
 between our hearts their strict community 
 and that the bounteous wizard then would place 
 vanna and bice and my gentle love 
 companions of our wandering , and would grace 
 with passionate talk , wherever we might rove 
 our time , and each were as content and free 
 as i believe that thou and i should be

 us well acquainted with this place : but here 
 we , as yourselves , are strangers . not long erst 
 we came , before you but a little space 
 by other road so rough and hard , that now 
 the ’ ascent will seem to us as play . ” the spirits 
 who from my breathing had perceiv 'd i liv 'd 
 grew pale with wonder . as the multitude 
 flock round a herald , sent with olive branch 
 to hear what news he brings , and in their haste 
 tread one another down , e'en so at sight 
 of me those happy spirits were fix 'd , each one 
 forgetful of its errand , to depart 
 where cleans 'd from sin , it might be made all fair 

‘ for this true nobleness i seek in vain 
 in woman and in man i find it not

 thou find'st it not ? i pray thee look again 
 look inward through the depths of thine own soul 
 how is it with thee ? art thou sound and whole 
 doth narrow search show thee no earthly stain 
 be noble ! and the nobleness that lies 
 in other men , sleeping , but never dead 
 will rise in majesty to meet thine own 
 then wilt thou see it gleam in many eyes 
 then will pure light around thy path be shed 
 and thou wilt nevermore be sad and lone 

“ take this , and pour to jove ; that safe from harms

 surveys thy desolated realms below 
 his winged messenger to send from high 
 and lead thy way with heavenly augury

unhappy wit , like most mistaken things 
 atones not for that envy which it brings 
 in youth alone its empty praise we boast 
 but soon the short lived vanity is lost 
 like some fair flower the early spring supplies 
 that gaily blooms , but even in blooming dies 
 what is this wit , which must our cares employ 
 the owner 's wife , that other men enjoy 
 then most our trouble still when most admired 
 and still the more we give , the more required 
 whose fame with pains we guard , but lose with ease 
 sure some to vex , but never all to please 
 ‘ tis what the vicious fear , the virtuous shun 
 by fools ‘ tis hated , and by knaves undone 

the bravest of th ’ aetolians , periphas 
 ochesius ’ stalwart son , he just had slain 
 and stood in act to strip him of his arms 
 the helmet then of darkness pallas donn 'd 
 to hide her presence from the sight of mars 
 but when the blood stain 'd god of war beheld 
 advancing tow'rd him godlike diomed 
 the corpse of stalwart periphas he left 
 there where he fell , to lie ; while he himself 
 of valiant diomed th ’ encounter met 
 when near they came , first mars his pond'rous spear 
 advane 'd beyond the yoke and horses ’ reins 
 with murd'rous aim ; but pallas from the car 
 turn 'd it aside , and foil 'd the vain attempt 

some truths there be are better left unsaid 
 much is there that we may not speak unblamed 
 on words , as wings , how many joys have fled 
 the jealous fairies love not to be named 
 there is an old world tale of one whose bed 
 a genius graced , to all , save him , unknown 
 one day the secret passed his lips , and sped 
 as secrets speed — thenceforth he slept alone 
 too much , oh ! far too much is told in books 
 too broad a daylight wraps us all and each 
 ah ! it is well that , deeper than our looks 
 some secrets lie beyond conjecture 's reach 
 ah ! it is well that in the soul are nooks 
 that will not open to the keys of speech

 or wedged whole ages in a bodkin 's eye 
 gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain 
 while , clogg 'd , he beats his silken wings in vain 
 or alum styptics with contracting power 
 shrink his thin essence like a rivell 'd flower

thou radiant coachman , running endless course 
 fountain of heat , of light the lively source

 may but begin thy praise : alas ! i fare 
 much like to one that in the clouds doth stare 
 to count the quails , that with their shadow cover 
 the italian sea , when soaring hither over 
 fain of a milder and more fruitful clime

now friends conversing my soft hours refine 
 and tully 's tusculum revives in mine 
 now to grave books i bid the mind retreat 
 and such as make me rather good than great 
 or o'er the works of easy fancy rove 
 where flutes and innocence amuse the grove 
 the native bard that on sicilian plains 
 first sung the lowly manners of the swains 
 or maro 's muse , that in the fairest light 
 paints rural prospects and the charms of sight 
 these soft amusements bring content along 
 and fancy , void of sorrow , turns to song 
 here beauteous health for all the year remain 
 when the next comes , i 'll charm thee thus again 

when all the hungry pain of love i bear 
 and in poor lightless thought but burn and burn 
 and wit goes hunting wisdom everywhere 
 yet can no word of revelation learn 
 when endlessly the scales of yea and nay 
 in dreadful motion fall and rise and fall 
 when all my heart in sorrow i could pay 
 until at last were left no tear at all 
 then if with tame or subtle argument 
 companions come and draw me to a place 
 where words are but the tappings of content 
 and life spreads all her garments with a grace 
 i curse that ease , and hunger in my heart 
 back to my pain and lonely to depart

 affronting all , yet fond of a good name

all childhood , reverence clothed thee , undefined 
 as for some being of another race 
 ah , not with it , departing — growing apace 
 as years did bring me manhood 's loftier mind 
 able to see thy human life behind 
 the same hid heart , the same revealing face 
 my own dim contest settling into grace 
 of sorrow , strife , and victory combined 
 so i beheld my god , in childhood 's morn 
 a mist , a darkness , great , and far apart 
 moveless and dim — i scarce could say thou art 
 my manhood came , of joy and sadness born 
 full soon the misty dark , asunder torn 
 revealed man 's glory , god 's great human heart

 the mournful hour that tore his son away

 yet busied with his slaves , to ease his woe

 nor food nor wine refused ; but since the day 
 that you to pylos plough 'd the watery way 
 nor wine nor food he tastes ; but , sunk in woes 
 wild springs the vine , no more the garden blows 
 shut from the walks of men , to pleasure lost 
 pensive and pale he wanders half a ghost 

to check the invader 's horror spreading course 
 the barrier fort opposed unequal force 
 that fort whose walls , extending wide , contained 
 the stay of persia , men to battle trained 
 soon as huj í r the dusky crowd descried 
 he on his own presumptuous arm relied 
 and left the fort ; in mail with shield and spear 
 vaunting he spoke — “ what hostile force is here 
 what chieftain dares our war like realms invade 
 “ and who art thou ? ” sohr á b indignant said 
 rushing towards him with undaunted look 
 “ hast thou , audacious ! nerve and soul to brook 
 the crocodile in fight , that to the strife 
 singly thou comest , reckless of thy life 

— yet , when at last , in deep repose he lay 
 his classic features , and unfurrow 'd brow 
 wearing the symmetry of earlier days 
 which death , as if relenting , render 'd back 
 in transitory gleam , ‘ twas sweet to hear 
 his aged pastor at the coffin side 
 bearing full tribute to his piety 
 so many lustrums , that consistent faith 
 which nerv 'd his journey and had led him home 
 home ?— yes ! give thanks , ye , who still travel on 
 oft startled , as some pilgrim from your side 
 falls through the arches of time 's broken bridge 
 without a warning , and is seen no more 
 give thanks that he is safe ,— at home ,— in heaven 

i think of thee !— my thoughts do twine and bud 
 about thee , as wild vines , about a tree 
 put out broad leaves , and soon there 's nought to see 
 except the straggling green which hides the wood 
 yet , o my palm tree , be it understood 
 i will not have my thoughts instead of thee 
 who art dearer , better ! rather , instantly 
 renew thy presence ; as a strong tree should 
 rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare 
 and let these bands of greenery which insphere thee 
 drop heavily down ,— burst , shattered everywhere 
 because , in this deep joy to see and hear thee 
 and breathe within thy shadow a new air 
 i do not think of thee — i am too near thee 

blown in the morning , thou shalt fade ere noon 
 what boots a life which in such haste forsakes thee 
 thou'rt wondrous frolic , being to die so soon 
 and passing proud a little color makes thee 
 if thee thy brittle beauty so deceives 
 know then the thing that swells thee is thy bane 
 for the same beauty cloth , in bloody leaves 
 the sentence of thy early death contain 
 some clown 's coarse lungs will poison thy sweet flower 
 if by the careless plough thou shalt be torn 
 and many herods lie in wait each hour 
 to murder thee as soon as thou art born 
 nay , force thy bud to blow — their tyrant breath 
 anticipating life , to hasten death 

the lad disguised was terrified to death 
 each plan was dissipated with a breath 
 the more he thought of means from thence to get 
 the greater were the obstacles he met 
 at length necessity ( the parent found 
 of stratagems and wiles , so much renowned 
 induced the youth . . . ( i scarcely can proceed 
 to tie . . . expression here i clearly need 
 what word will decently express the thought 
 what book has got it ?— where should it be sought

 with windows in their bosoms were designed 
 through which ‘ twas easy all within to see 
 and suited those of medical degree 

me doubt possess 'd , and “ speak , ” it whisper 'd me 
 “ speak , speak unto thy lady , that she quench 
 thy thirst with drops of sweetness . ” yet blank awe 
 which lords it o'er me , even at the sound 
 of beatrice 's name , did bow me down 
 as one in slumber held . not long that mood 
 beatrice suffer 'd : she , with such a smile 
 as might have made one blest amid the flames 
 beaming upon me , thus her words began 
 “ thou in thy thought art pond'ring ( as i deem 
 and what i deem is truth how just revenge 
 could be with justice punish 'd : from which doubt 
 i soon will free thee ; so thou mark my words 
 for they of weighty matter shall possess thee 

woe to the sceptic in these party days 
 who wafts to neither shrine his puffs of praise 
 for him no pension pours its annual fruits 
 no fertile sinecure spontaneous shoots 
 not his the meed that crowned don hookham 's rhyme 
 nor sees he e'er in dreams of future time 
 those shadowy forms of sleek reversions rise 
 so dear to scotchmen 's second sighted eyes 
 yet who that looks to history 's damning leaf 
 where whig and tory , thief opposed to thief 
 on either side in lofty shame are seen 
 while freedom 's form lies crucified between 
 who , burdett , who such rival rogues can see 
 but flies from both to honesty and thee

 which me too oft of rest hath hinder è d 
 and whiter skin with white sheet cover è d 
 and softer cheek doth on soft pillow rest

he said , nor did apollo not obey 
 his sire 's commands ; from ida 's heights he flew 
 like to a falcon , swooping on a dove 
 swiftest of birds ; then priam 's son he found 
 the godlike hector , stretch 'd at length no more 
 but sitting , now to consciousness restor 'd 
 with recognition looking on his friends 
 the cold sweat dried , nor gasping now for breath 
 since by the will of aegis bearing jove 
 to life new waken 'd ; close beside him stood 
 the far destroyer , and address 'd him thus 
 “ hector , thou son of priam , why apart 
 from all thy comrades art thou sitting here 
 feeble and faint ? what trouble weighs thee down 

look how the pale queen of the silent night 
 doth cause the ocean to attend upon her 
 and he , as long as she is in his sight 
 with his full tide is ready her to honor 
 but when the silver wagon of the moon 
 is mounted up so high he cannot follow 
 the sea calls home his crystal waves to moan 
 and with low ebb doth manifest his sorrow 
 so you that are the sovereign of my heart 
 have all my joys attending on your will 
 my joys low ebbing when you do depart 
 when you return , their tide my heart doth fill 
 so as you come , and as you do depart 
 joys ebb and flow within my tender heart 

hath he not deeds to do and days to see 
 yet ere the day that is to see him dead 
 beats there no brain yet in the poisonous head 
 throbs there no treason ? if no such thing there be 
 if no such thought , surely this is not he 
 look to the hands then ; are the hands not red 
 what are the shadows about this man 's bed 
 death , was not this the cupbearer to thee 
 nay , let him live then , till in this life 's stead 
 even he shall pray for that thou hast to give 
 till seeing his hopes and not his memories fled 
 even he shall cry upon thee a bitter cry 
 that life is worse than death ; then let him live 
 till death seem worse than life ; then let him die 

say over again , and yet once over again 
 that thou dost love me . though the word repeated 
 should seem a “ cuckoo song , ” as thou dost treat it 
 remember , never to the hill or plain 
 valley and wood , without her cuckoo strain 
 comes the fresh spring in all her green completed 
 beloved , i , amid the darkness greeted 
 by a doubtful spirit voice , in that doubt 's pain 
 cry , “ speak once more — thou lovest ! ” who can fear 
 too many stars , though each in heaven shall roll 
 too many flowers , though each shall crown the year 
 say thou dost love me , love me , love me — toll 
 the silver iterance !— only minding , dear 
 to love me also in silence with thy soul 

iv . moreover , were there perfect harmony 
 ‘ twixt soul and nature , we should never waste 
 the precious hours in gazing , but should haste 
 to assimilate her offerings , and we 
 from high life elements , as doth the tree 
 should grow to higher ; so what we call taste 
 is a slow living as of roots encased 
 in the grim chinks of some sterility 
 both cramping and withholding . art is truth 
 but truth dammed up and frozen , gagged and bound 
 as is a streamlet icy and uncouth 
 which pebbles hath and channel but no sound 
 give it again its summer heart of youth 
 and it will be a life upon the ground

 he comes with megaphone and specious cheer

 they over act each part . but at the height 
 of banter and of canter and delight

 the masks go back . ‘ tis one more joke . laugh on

can i forget the dismal night that gave 
 my soul 's best part forever to the grave 
 how silent did his old companions tread 
 by midnight lamps , the mansions of the dead 
 through breathing statues , then unheeded things 
 through rows of warriors , and through walks of kings 
 what awe did the slow solemn knell inspire 
 the pealing organ , and the pausing choir 
 the duties by the lawn robed prelate paid 
 and the last words , that dust to dust conveyed 
 while speechless o'er thy closing grave we bend 
 accept these tears , thou dear departed friend 
 oh , gone forever ! take this long adieu 
 and sleep in peace next thy loved montague

it is not to be thought of that the flood 
 of british freedom , which to the open sea 
 of the world 's praise from dark antiquity 
 hath flowed , ‘ with pomp of waters , unwithstood 
 roused though it be full often to a mood 
 which spurns the check of salutary bands 
 that this most famous stream in bogs and sands 
 should perish , and to evil and to good 
 be lost forever . in our halls is hung 
 armoury of the invincible knights of old 
 we must be free or die , who speak the tongue 
 that shakespeare spake ; the faith and morals hold 
 which milton held .— in everything we are sprung 
 of earth 's first blood , have titles manifold 

for three and thirty years , a living seed 
 a lonely germ , dropt on our waste world 's side 
 thy death and rising thou didst calmly bide 
 sore companied by many a clinging weed 
 sprung from the fallow soil of evil and need 
 hither and thither tossed , by friends denied 
 pitied of goodness dull , and scorned of pride 
 until at length was done the awful deed 
 and thou didst lie outworn in stony bower 
 three days asleep — oh , slumber godlike brief 
 for man of sorrows and acquaint with grief 
 life seed thou diedst , that death might lose his power 
 and thou , with rooted stem and shadowy leaf 
 rise , of humanity the crimson flower 

i said i splendidly loved you ; it 's not true 
 such long swift tides stir not a land locked sea 
 on gods or fools the high risk falls — on you 
 the clean clear bitter sweet that 's not for me 
 love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist 
 love is flung lucifer like from heaven to hell 
 but — there are wanderers in the middle mist 
 who cry for shadows , clutch , and cannot tell 
 whether they love at all , or , loving , whom 
 an old song 's lady , a fool in fancy dress 
 or phantoms , or their own face on the gloom 
 for love of love , or from heart 's loneliness 
 pleasure 's not theirs , nor pain . they doubt , and sigh 
 and do not love at all . of these am i 

drawn with th'attractive virtue of her eyes 
 my touched heart turns it to that happy coast 
 my joyful north , where all my fortune lies 
 the level of my hopes desir è d most 
 there where my delia , fairer than the sun 
 decked with her youth whereon the world doth smile 
 joys in that honour which her eyes have won 
 th'eternal wonder of our happy isle 
 flourish , fair albion , glory of the north 
 neptune 's best darling , held between his arms 
 divided from the world as better worth

“ you know , you dogs , your master long has felt 
 a keen distemper in the royal pelt 
 a testy , superficial irritation

 you 've plundered scotland of its plants , the seas 
 you 've ravished , and despoiled the hebrides

 which shines within the shadow of her sill 
 how shall we lift this strangeness which doth fill 
 her human heart to breaking ,— we who miss 
 in our immortal joy , the enlight'ning kiss 
 of sorrow 's bitter lips whence comforts thrill 
 how shall we sing to her of joys to come 
 to her who bears upon her breast the sum 
 of death 's dread gloom and heaven 's undying light 
 lean close , ah , close , about her from above 
 behold upon the mildness of her love 
 enthroned the terrors of his holy might 

“ as ever on this side the boiling wave

my own beloved , who hast lifted me 
 from this drear flat of earth where i was thrown 
 and , in betwixt the languid ringlets , blown 
 a life breath , till the forehead hopefully 
 shines out again , as all the angels see 
 before thy saving kiss ! my own , my own 
 who camest to me when the world was gone 
 and i who looked for only god , found thee 
 i find thee ; i am safe , and strong , and glad 
 as one who stands in dewless asphodel 
 looks backward on the tedious time he had 
 in the upper life ,— so i , with bosom swell 
 make witness , here , between the good and bad 
 that love , as strong as death , retrieves as well 

the bubbling brook doth leap when i come by 
 because my feet find measure with its call 
 the birds know when the friend they love is nigh 
 for i am known to them , both great and small 
 the flower that on the lonely hillside grows 
 expects me there when spring its bloom has given 
 and many a tree and bush my wanderings knows 
 and e'en the clouds and silent stars of heaven 
 for he who with his maker walks aright 
 shall be their lord as adam was before 
 his ear shall catch each sound with new delight 
 each object wear the dress that then it wore 
 and he , as when erect in soul he stood

what ancient times , those times we fancy wise 
 have left on long record of woman 's rise 
 what morals teach it , and what fables hide 
 what author wrote it , how that author died

 ye modern beauties ! where the poet drew 
 his softest pencil , think he dreamt of you 
 and warn 'd by him , ye wanton pens , beware

 who ne'er , not in a dream , did taste delight 
 may thee importune who like case pretends 
 and seems to joy in woe , in woe 's despite 
 tell me ( so may thou fortune milder try 
 and long , long sing ) for what thou thus complains 
 since winter 's gone , and sun in dappled sky 
 enamour 'd , smiles on woods and flowery plains

 with trembling wings sigh 'd forth , ‘ i love , i love 

to this harangue the wary youth replied 
 in truth , fair lady , i could ne'er decide 
 to criticise what others round may do 
 ‘ tis not the line i 'd willingly pursue 
 and i will freely say , that your discourse 
 has much surprised me , though ‘ tis void of force 
 to you it surely never can belong 
 to say variety in love is wrong 
 besides , your sex , and decency , ‘ tis clear 
 to ev'ry disadvantage you appear 
 what use this eloquence , and what your aim 
 such charms alone as your 's could me inflame 
 their pow'r is great , but fully i declare 
 i do not like advances from the fair 

beloved moment ! then ‘ twas first i caught 
 the first foundation of romantic thought 
 then first i shed bold fancy 's thrilling tear 
 then first that poesy charm 'd mine infant ear 
 soon stored with much of legendary lore 
 the sports of childhood charm 'd my soul no more 
 far from the scene of gaiety and noise 
 far , far from turbulent and empty joys 
 i hied me to the thick overarching shade 
 and there , on mossy carpet , listless laid 
 while at my feet the rippling runnel ran 
 the days of wild romance antique i 'd scan 
 soar on the wings of fancy through the air 
 to realms of light , and pierce the radiance there 

ah me ! and i am now the man whose muse 
 in happier times was wont to laugh at love 
 and those who suffer 'd that blind boy abuse 
 the noble gifts were given them from above 
 what metamorphose strange is this i prove i 
 myself now scarce i find myself to be 
 and think no fable circe 's tyranny 
 and all the tales are told of changed jove 
 virtue hath taught with her philosophy 
 my mind into a better course to move 
 reason may chide her fill , and oft reprove 
 affection 's power , but what is that to me 
 who ever think , and never think on ought 
 but that bright cherubim which thralls my thought 

and thou who fearest something that may come 
 around whose house the storm of terror breaks 
 all night ; to whose love sharpened ear , all day 
 the invisible is calling at the door 
 to render up a life thou canst not keep 
 or love that will not stay ,— open thy door 
 and carry out thy dying to the marge 
 of the great sea ; yea , walk into the flood 
 and lay thy dead upon the moaning waves 
 give them to god to bury ; float them again 
 with sighs and prayers to waft them through the gloom 
 back to the spring of life . say — “ if they die 
 thou , the one life of life , art still alive 
 and thou canst make thy dead alive again 

as the chill 'd robin , bound to florida 
 upon a morn of autumn , crosses flying 
 the air track of a snipe most passing fair 
 yet colder in her blood than she is fair 
 and as that robin lingers on the wing 
 and feels the snipe 's flight in the eddying air 
 and loves her for her coldness not the less 
 but fain would win her to that warmer sky 
 where love lies waking with the fragrant stars 
 lo i — a languisher for sunnier climes 
 where fruit , leaf , blossom , on the trees forever 
 image the tropic deathlessness of love 
 have met , and long 'd to win thee , fairest lady 
 to a more genial clime than cold broadway 

since the first look that led me to this error 
 to this thoughts ’ maze to my confusion tending 
 still have i lived in grief , in hope , in terror 
 the circle of my sorrows never ending 
 yet cannot leave her love that holds me hateful 
 her eyes exact it , though her heart disdains me 
 see what reward he hath that serves th'ungrateful 
 so true and loyal love no favour gains me 
 still must i whet my young desires abated 
 upon the flint of such a heart rebelling 
 and all in vain ; her pride is so innated 
 she yields no place at all for pity 's dwelling 
 oft have i told her that my soul did love her 
 and that with tears ; yet all this will not move her 

i had no thought of violets of late 
 the wild , shy kind that spring beneath your feet 
 in wistful april days , when lovers mate 
 and wander through the fields in raptures sweet 
 the thought of violets meant florists ’ shops 
 and bows and pins , and perfumed papers fine 
 and garish lights , and mincing little fops 
 and cabarets and songs , and deadening wine 
 so far from sweet real things my thoughts had strayed 
 i had forgot wide fields , and clear brown streams 
 the perfect loveliness that god has made 
 wild violets shy and heaven mounting dreams 
 and now — unwittingly , you 've made me dream 
 of violets , and my soul 's forgotten gleam 

my god , my god , how much i love my goddess 
 whose virtues rare , unto the heavens arise 
 my god , my god , how much i love her eyes 
 one shining bright , the other full of hardness 
 my god , my god , how much i love her wisdom 
 whose works may ravish heaven 's richest maker 
 of whose eyes ’ joys if i might be partaker 
 then to my soul a holy rest would come 
 my god , how much i love to hear her speak 
 whose hands i kiss and ravished oft rekisseth 
 when she stands wotless whom so much she blesseth 
 say then , what mind this honest love would break 
 since her perfections pure , withouten blot 
 makes her beloved of thee , she knoweth not 

she blessed them , and with voices lifted up 
 in loud lament the dregs of sorrow 's cup 
 they drained together . orpah , weeping , turned 
 and slowly went , but ruth with eyes that yearned 
 into naomi 's , cried aloud in pain 
 “ thus to forsake thee , urge me not again 
 nor to return from following after thee 
 for where thou goest , i will surely go 
 and where thou lodgest , will i lodge also 
 thy people shall be my people evermore 
 and thy god only will i now adore 
 and where thou diest , i will buried be 
 so may jehovah strike me with his thunder 
 if aught but only death our lives shall sunder 

thee had we followed through the twilight land 
 where thought grows form , and matter is refined 
 back into thought of the eternal mind 
 till , seeing them one , lo , in the morn we stand 
 then started fresh and followed , hand in hand 
 with sense divinely growing , till , combined 
 we heard the music of the planets wind 
 in harmony with billows on the strand 
 till , one with earth and all god 's utterance 
 we hardly knew whether the sun outspake 
 or a glad sunshine from our spirits brake 
 whether we think , or winds and blossoms dance 
 alas , o poet leader , for such good 
 thou wast god 's tragedy , writ in tears and blood 

a little garden on a bleak hillside 
 where deep the heavy , dazzling mountain snow 
 lies far into the spring . the sun 's pale glow 
 is scarcely able to melt patches wide 
 about the single rose bush . all denied 
 of nature 's tender ministries . but no 
 for wonder working faith has made it blow 
 with flowers many hued and starry eyed 
 here sleeps the sun long , idle summer hours 
 here butterflies and bees fare far to rove 
 amid the crumpled leaves of poppy flowers 
 here four o'clocks , to the passionate night above 
 fling whiffs of perfume , like pale incense showers 
 a little garden , loved with a great love 

in the dim chamber whence but yesterday 
 passed my belov è d , filled with awe i stand 
 and haunting loves fluttering on every hand 
 whisper her praises who is far away 
 a thousand delicate fancies glance and play 
 on every object which her robes have fanned 
 and tenderest thoughts and hopes bloom and expand 
 in the sweet memory of her beauty 's ray 
 ah ! could that glass but hold the faintest trace 
 of all the loveliness once mirrored there 
 the clustering glory of the shadowy hair 
 that framed so well the dear young angel face 
 but no , it shows my own face , full of care 
 and my heart is her beauty 's dwelling place 

yes , call me by my pet name ! let me hear 
 the name i used to run at , when a child 
 from innocent play , and leave the cowslips plied 
 to glance up in some face that proved me dear 
 with the look of its eyes . i miss the clear 
 fond voices which , being drawn and reconciled 
 into the music of heaven 's undefiled 
 call me no longer . silence on the bier 
 while i call god — call god !— so let thy mouth 
 be heir to those who are now exanimate 
 gather the north flowers to complete the south 
 and catch the early love up in the late 
 yes , call me by that name ,— and i , in truth 
 with the same heart , will answer and not wait 

when to the sessions of sweet silent thought 
 i summon up remembrance of things past 
 i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought 
 and with old woes new wail my dear time 's waste 
 then can i drown an eye ( unused to flow 
 for precious friends hid in death 's dateless night 
 and weep afresh love 's long since cancelled woe 
 and moan th ’ expense of many a vanished sight 
 then can i grieve at grievances foregone 
 and heavily from woe to woe tell o'er 
 the sad account of fore bemoaned moan 
 which i new pay as if not paid before 
 but if the while i think on thee ( dear friend 
 all losses are restored , and sorrows end 

it hath been heretofore my chance to see 
 horsemen with martial order shifting camp 
 to onset sallying , or in muster rang 'd 
 or in retreat sometimes outstretch 'd for flight 
 light armed squadrons and fleet foragers 
 scouring thy plains , arezzo ! have i seen 
 and clashing tournaments , and tilting jousts 
 now with the sound of trumpets , now of bells 
 tabors , or signals made from castled heights 
 and with inventions multiform , our own 
 or introduc 'd from foreign land ; but ne'er 
 to such a strange recorder i beheld 
 in evolution moving , horse nor foot 
 nor ship , that tack 'd by sign from land or star 

the mountains wonder from their cloudy height 
 the skies look on and grow more deep with awe 
 from these two women , earthly loves withdraw 
 and leave them shrined in some ensphering light 
 more fine than that which greets the earthly sight 
 more glorious than that creation saw 
 when , from abeyance to primeval law 
 there burst the dawn from out the womb of night 
 yet are all things unchanged around them ,— these 
 the ancient hills , the town , the quiet trees 
 the household presences through which they grope 
 blind to all else but to each other 's eyes 
 wherein , transforming heaven and earth , there lies 
 sublime effulgence of immortal hope 

in vaine i seeke and sew to her for grace 
 and doe myne humbled hart before her poure 
 the whiles her foot she in my necke doth place 
 and tread my life downe in the lowly floure 
 and yet the lyon , that is lord of power 
 and reigneth over every beast in field 
 in his most pride disdeigneth to devoure 
 the silly lambe that to his might doth yield 
 but she , more cruell and more salvage wylde 
 than either lyon or the lyonesse 
 shames not to be with guiltlesse bloud defylde 
 but taketh glory in her cruelnesse 
 fayrer then fayrest ! let none ever say 
 that ye were blooded in a yeelded pray 

guido , i would that lapo , thou , and i 
 led by some strong enchantment , might ascend 
 a magic ship , whose charmed sails should fly 
 with winds at will where'er our thoughts might wend 
 so that no change , nor any evil chance 
 should mar our joyous voyage ; but it might be 
 that even satiety should still enhance 
 between our hearts their strict community 
 and that the bounteous wizard then would place 
 vanna and bice and my gentle love 
 companions of our wandering , and would grace 
 with passionate talk , wherever we might rove 
 our time , and each were as content and free 
 as i believe that thou and i should be 

haunted of beauty , like the marvellous youth 
 who sang saint agnes ’ eve ! how passing fair 
 her shapes took color in thy homestead air 
 how on thy canvas even her dreams were truth 
 magician ! who from commonest elements 
 called up divine ideals , clothed upon 
 by mystic lights soft blending into one 
 womanly grace and child like innocence 
 teacher i thy lesson was not given in vain 
 beauty is goodness ; ugliness is sin 
 art 's place is sacred : nothing foul therein 
 may crawl or tread with bestial feet profane 
 if rightly choosing is the painter 's test 
 thy choice , o master , ever was the best 

‘ t is you that are the music , not your song 
 the song is but a door which , opening wide 
 lets forth the pent up melody inside 
 your spirit 's harmony , which clear and strong 
 sings but of you . throughout your whole life long 
 your songs , your thoughts , your doings , each divide 
 this perfect beauty ; waves within a tide 
 or single notes amid a glorious throng 
 the song of earth has many different chords 
 ocean has many moods and many tones 
 yet always ocean . in the damp spring woods 
 the painted trillium smiles , while crisp pine cones 
 autumn alone can ripen . so is this 
 one music with a thousand cadences 

lift up the curtain carefully . all the trees 
 stand in the dark like drowsy sentinels 
 the oak is talkative to night ; he tells 
 the little bushes crowding at his knees 
 that formidable , hard , voluminous 
 history of growth from acorn into age 
 they titter like school children ; they arouse 
 their comrades , who exclaim : ‘ he is very sage 
 look how the moon is staring through that cloud 
 laying and lifting idle streaks of light 
 o hark ! was that the monstrous wind , so loud 
 and sudden , prowling always through the night 
 let down the shaking curtain . they are queer 
 those foreigners . they and we live so near 

i 'd be concerned in no litigious jar 
 beloved by all , not vainly popular 
 whate'er assistance i had power to bring 
 t ’ oblige my company , or to serve my king 
 whene'er they called , i 'd readily afford 
 my tongue , my pen , my counsel , or my sword 
 lawsuits i 'd shun , with as much studious care 
 as i would dens where hungry lions are 
 and rather put up injuries , than be 
 a plague to him who 'd be a plague to me 
 i value quiet at a price too great 
 to give for my revenge so dear a rate 
 for what do we by all our bustle gain 
 but counterfeit delight for real pain 

once more upon the ocean 's heaving breast 
 he lays his head , not like the lover bold 
 who in the brave , chivalric days of old 
 wooed from her lips the secret of the west 
 but like a tired man going to his rest 
 no hopes to thrill , no yearnings to inspire 
 no tasks to burden , and no toil to tire 
 no morn to waken to a day of quest 
 again upon the trackless deep ,— again 
 about him as of yore the wild winds play 
 behind him lies the world he gave to men 
 before a grave in old castile for aye 
 peace , winds and tides ! be calm , thou guardian sky 
 the lordliest dust of earth is passing by 

stern be the pilot in the dreadful hour 
 when a great nation , like a ship at sea 
 with the wroth breakers whitening at her lee 
 feels her last shudder if her helmsman cower 
 a godlike manhood be his mighty dower 
 such and so gifted , lincoln , may'st thou be 
 with thy high wisdom 's low simplicity 
 and awful tenderness of voted power 
 from our hot records then thy name shall stand 
 on time 's calm ledger out of passionate days 
 with the pure debt of gratitude begun 
 and only paid in never ending praise 
 one of the many of a mighty land 
 made by god 's providence the anointed one 

straightway did andrew answer him again 
 “ almighty god with ease can rescue me 
 from all my grief — he who in days of yore 
 fettered thee fast with fiery chains in woe 
 there , shorn of glory , bound with torments fierce 
 in exile hast thou dwelt e'er since the day 
 when thou didst set at naught the word of god 
 of heaven 's king ; then did thy woe begin 
 and to thy exile there shall be no end 
 but thou shalt still heap up thy wretchedness 
 to everlasting life , and evermore 
 thy lot shall grow yet harsher day by day 
 then fled that fiend who in the years long past 
 began a deadly feud against his god 

if ever sorrow spoke from soul that loves 
 as speaks a spirit in a man possest 
 in me her spirit speaks . my soul it moves 
 whose sigh swoll'n words breed whirlwinds in my breast 
 or like the echo of a passing bell 
 which sounding on the water seems to howl 
 so rings my heart a fearful heavy knell 
 and keeps all night in consort with the owl 
 my cheeks with a thin ice of tears are clad 
 mine eyes like morning stars are bleared and red 
 what resteth then but i be raging mad 
 to see that she , my cares ’ chief conduit head 
 when all streams else help quench my burning heart 
 shuts up her springs and will no grace impart 

whether he lurked in the oldtown fen 
 or the gray earth flax of the devil 's den 
 or swam in the wooded artichoke 
 or coiled by the northman 's written rock 
 nothing on record is left to show 
 only the fact that he lived , we know 
 and left the cast of a double head 
 in the scaly mask which he yearly shed 
 for he earned a head where his tail should be 
 and the two , of course , could never agree 
 but wriggled about with main and might 
 now to the left and now to the right 
 pulling and twisting this way and that 
 neither knew what the other was at 

thus raged both armies like conflicting fires 
 while nestor ’ s chariot far from fight retires 
 his coursers steep ’ d in sweat , and stain ’ d with gore 
 the greeks ’ preserver , great machaon , bore 
 that hour achilles , from the topmost height 
 of his proud fleet , o ’ erlook ’ d the fields of fight 
 his feasted eyes beheld around the plain 
 the grecian rout , the slaying , and the slain 
 his friend machaon singled from the rest 
 a transient pity touch ’ d his vengeful breast 
 straight to menoetius ’ much loved son he sent 
 graceful as mars , patroclus quits his tent 
 in evil hour ! then fate decreed his doom 
 and fix ’ d the date of all his woes to come 

guard thou , my son , the helpless and the poor 
 nor in the chains of thine own indolence 
 slumber enervate , while the joys of sense 
 engross thee ; and thou say'st , “ i ask no more 
 wise men the shepherd 's slumber will deplore 
 when the rapacious wolf has leapt the fence 
 and ranges thro ’ the fold .— my son , dispense 
 those laws , that justice to the wrong 'd restore 
 the common weal shou 'd be the first pursuit 
 of the crown 'd warrior , for the royal brows 
 the people first enwreath 'd .— they are the root 
 the king the tree . aloft he spreads his boughs 
 glorious ; but learn , impetuous youth , at length 
 trees from the root alone derive their strength 

since fate relentless stopp 'd their heavenly voice 
 no more the forests ring , or groves rejoice 
 who now shall charm the shades , where cowley strung 
 his living harp , and lofty denham sung 
 but hark ! the groves rejoice , the forest rings 
 are these revived ? or is it granville sings 
 ‘ tis yours , my lord , to bless our soft retreats 
 and call the muses to their ancient seats 
 to paint anew the flowery sylvan scenes 
 to crown the forest with immortal greens 
 make windsor hills in lofty numbers rise 
 and lift her turrets nearer to the skies 
 to sing those honours you deserve to wear 
 and add new lustre to her silver star 

hear what the desolate rizpah said 
 as on gibeah 's rocks she watched the dead 
 the sons of michal before her lay 
 and her own fair children , dearer than they 
 by a death of shame they all had died 
 and were stretched on the bare rock , side by side 
 and rizpah , once the loveliest of all 
 that bloomed and smiled in the court of saul 
 all wasted with watching and famine now 
 and scorched by the sun her haggard brow 
 sat mournfully guarding their corpses there 
 and murmured a strange and solemn air 
 the low , heart broken , and wailing strain 
 of a mother that mourns her children slain 

let me not to the marriage of true minds 
 admit impediments . love is not love 
 which alters when it alteration finds 
 or bends with the remover to remove 
 o , no ! it is an ever fixed mark 
 that looks on tempests and is never shaken 
 it is the star to every wandering bark 
 whose worth 's unknown , although his height be taken 
 love 's not time 's fool , though rosy lips and cheeks 
 within his bending sickle 's compass come 
 love alters not with his brief hours and weeks 
 but bears it out even to the edge of doom 
 if this be error and upon me proved 
 i never writ , nor no man ever loved 

pensive within the coliseum 's walls 
 i stood with thee , o poet of the west 
 the day when each had been a welcome guest 
 in san clemente 's venerable halls 
 with what delight my memory now recalls 
 that hour of hours , that flower of all the rest 
 when , with thy white beard falling on thy breast 
 that noble head , that well might serve as paul 's 
 in some divinest vision of the saint 
 by raffael dreamed — i heard thee mourn the dead 
 the martyred host who fearless there , though faint 
 walked the rough road that up to heaven 's gate led 
 these were the pictures calderon loved to paint 
 in golden hues that here perchance have fled 

sweet smile ! the daughter of the queene of love 
 expressing all thy mothers powrefull art 
 with which she wonts to temper angry iove 
 when all the gods he threats with thundring dart 
 sweet is thy vertue , as thy selfe sweet art 
 for when on me thou shinedst late in sadnesse 
 a melting pleasance ran through every part 
 and me revived with hart robbing gladnesse 
 whylest rapt with ioy resembling heavenly madness 
 my soule was ravisht quite as in a traunce 
 and , feeling thence no more her sorrowes sadnesse 
 fed on the fulnesse of that chearfull glaunce 
 more sweet than nectar , or ambrosiall meat 
 seem 'd every bit which thenceforth i did eat 

dear are the forceful energies of song 
 for they do swell the spring tide of the heart 
 with rosier currents , and impel along 
 the life blood freely :— o ! they can impart 
 raptures ne'er dreamt of by the sordid throng 
 who barter human feeling at the mart 
 of pamper 'd selfishness , and thus do wrong 
 imperial nature of her prime desert 
 seward ! thy strains , beyond the critic praise 
 which may to arduous skill its meed assign 
 can the pure sympathies of spirit raise 
 to bright imagination 's throne divine 
 and proudly triumph , with a generous strife 
 o'er all the “ flat realities of life 

sweet summer queen , with trailing robe of green 
 what spell has thou to bind the heart to thee 
 thy throne is built upon the sun lit sea 
 where break the waves in clouds of silver sheen 
 and oft at dawn like some resplendent queen 
 thou sittest on the hills in majesty 
 and all the flowers wake at thy decree 
 but now farewell to all thy joys serene 
 the autumn comes with swift winged , silent flight 
 and he will woo thee with his fiery breath 
 in crimson robes and hues of flashing gold 
 he 'll clothe thee , and thy beauty in the night 
 will take a richer glow . but wintry death 
 will come and wrap thee in his fold 

“ fair truth alone ( the patient man replied 
 my words shall dictate , and my lips shall guide 
 to him , to me , one common lot was given 
 in equal woes , alas ! involved by heaven 
 much of his fates i know ; but check 'd by fear 
 i stand ; the hand of violence is here 
 here boundless wrongs the starry skies invade 
 and injured suppliants seek in vain for aid 
 let for a space the pensive queen attend 
 nor claim my story till the sun descend 
 then in such robes as suppliants may require 
 composed and cheerful by the genial fire 
 when loud uproar and lawless riot cease 
 shall her pleased ear receive my words in peace 

as draws the golden meteor of the day 
 exhaled matter from the ground to heaven 
 and by his secret nature , there to stay 
 the thing fast held , and yet of hold bereaven 
 so by th ’ attractive excellence and might 
 born to the power of thy transparent eyes 
 drawn from myself , ravished with thy delight 
 whose dumb conceits divinely sirenise 
 lo , in suspense of fear and hope upholden 
 diversely poised with passions that pain me 
 no resolution dares my thoughts embolden 
 since ‘ tis not i , but thou that dost sustain me 
 o if there 's none but thou can work my woe 
 wilt thou be still unkind and kill me so 

if glorious visions , born for all mankind 
 the bright auroras of our twilight mind 
 if fancies , varying as the shapes that lie 
 stained on the windows of the sunset sky 
 if hopes , that beckon with delusive gleams 
 till the eye dances in the void of dreams 
 if passions , following with the winds that urge 
 earth 's wildest wanderer to her farthest verge 
 if these on all some transient hours bestow 
 of rapture tingling with its hectic glow 
 then all are poets ; and if earth had rolled 
 her myriad centuries , and her doom were told 
 each moaning billow of her shoreless wave 
 would wail its requiem o'er a poet 's grave 

the frightened herds of clouds across the sky 
 trample the sunshine down , and chase the day 
 into the dusky forest lands of gray 
 and sombre twilight . far and faint , and high 
 the wild goose trails his harrow , with a cry 
 sad as the wail of some poor castaway 
 who sees a vessel drifting far astray 
 of his last hope , and lays him down to die 
 the children , riotous from school , grow bold 
 and quarrel with the wind whose angry gust 
 plucks off the summer hat , and flaps the fold 
 of many a crimson cloak , and twirls the dust 
 in spiral shapes grotesque , and dims the gold 
 of gleaming tresses with the blur of rust 

“ ye sons of atreus , and ye greeks , give ear 
 the words of troy , and troy ’ s great monarch , hear 
 pleased may ye hear ( so heaven succeed my prayers 
 what paris , author of the war , declares 
 the spoils and treasures he to ilion bore 
 ( oh had he perish ’ d ere they touch ’ d our shore 
 he proffers injured greece : with large increase 
 of added trojan wealth to buy the peace 
 but to restore the beauteous bride again 
 this greece demands , and troy requests in vain

 our slaughter ’ d heroes , and their bones inurn

 and whose the conquest , mighty jove decide 

“ thaumantia ! mount the winds , and stop their car 
 against the highest who shall wage the war 
 if furious yet they dare the vain debate 
 thus have i spoke , and what i speak is fate 
 their coursers crush ’ d beneath the wheels shall lie 
 their car in fragments , scatter ’ d o ’ er the sky 
 my lightning these rebellious shall confound 
 and hurl them flaming , headlong , to the ground 
 condemn ’ d for ten revolving years to weep 
 the wounds impress ’ d by burning thunder deep 
 so shall minerva learn to fear our ire 
 nor dare to combat hers and nature ’ s sire 
 for juno , headstrong and imperious still 
 she claims some title to transgress our will 

“ mother , ” he said , “ thou askest no great thing 
 some wretch too bad for death i soon shall find 
 who round her perfect neck his arms shall wind 
 she shall be driven from the palace gate 
 where once her crowd of worshippers would wait 
 from earliest morning till the dew was dry 
 on chance of seeing her gold gown glancing by 
 there through the storm of curses shall she go 
 in evil raiment midst the winter snow 
 or in the summer in rough sheepskins clad 
 and thus , o mother , shall i make thee glad 
 remembering all the honour thou hast brought 
 unto mine altars ; since as thine own thought 
 my thought is grown , my mind as thy dear mind 

some prouder muse , when comes the hour at last 
 may shake our hillsides with her bugle blast 
 not ours the task ; but since the lyric dress 
 relieves the statelier with its sprightliness 
 hear an old song , which some , perchance , have seen 
 in stale gazette or cobwebbed magazine 
 there was an hour when patriots dared profane 
 the mast that britain strove to bow in vain 
 and one , who listened to the tale of shame 
 whose heart still answered to that sacred name 
 whose eye still followed o'er his country 's tides 
 thy glorious flag , our brave old ironsides 
 from yon lone attic , on a smiling morn 
 thus mocked the spoilers with his school boy scorn 

it may be , love my death doth not pretend 
 although he shoots at me , but thinks it fit 
 thus to bewitch thee for thy benefit 
 causing thy will to my wish to condescend 
 for witches which some murder do intend 
 do make a picture and do shoot at it 
 and in that part where they the picture hit 
 the party 's self doth languish to his end 
 so love , too weak by force thy heart to taint 
 within my heart thy heavenly shape doth paint 
 suffering therein his arrows to abide 
 only to th'end he might by witches ’ art 
 within my heart pierce through thy picture 's side 
 and through thy picture 's side might wound my heart 

shall i compare thee to a summer 's day 
 thou art more lovely and more temperate 
 rough winds do shake the darling buds of may 
 and summer 's lease hath all too short a date 
 sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines 
 and often is his gold complexion dimmed 
 and every fair from fair sometime declines 
 by chance , or nature 's changing course untrimmed 
 but thy eternal summer shall not fade 
 nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st 
 nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade 
 when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st 
 so long as men can breathe or eyes can see 
 so long lives this , and this gives life to thee 

carved from the block or cast in clinging mould 
 will grateful memory fondly try her best 
 the mortal vesture from decay to wrest 
 his look shall greet us , calm , but ah , how cold 
 no breath can stir the brazen drapery 's fold 
 no throb can heave the statue 's stony breast 
 “ he is not here , but risen , ” will stand confest 
 in all we miss , in all our eyes behold 
 how nature loved him ! on his placid brow 
 thought 's ample dome , she set the sacred sign 
 that marks the priesthood of her holiest shrine 
 nor asked a leaflet from the laurel 's bough 
 that envious time might clutch or disallow 
 to prove her chosen minstrel 's song divine 

fraught with this cargo , and her fairest freight 
 delightful waltz , on tiptoe for a mate 
 the welcome vessel reach 'd the genial strand 
 and round her flock 'd the daughters of the land 
 not decent david , when , before the ark 
 his grand pas seul excited some remark 
 not love lorn quixote , when his sancho thought 
 the knight 's fandango friskier than it ought 
 not soft herodias , when , with winning tread 
 her nimble feet danced off another 's head 
 not cleopatra on her galley 's deck 
 display 'd so much of leg , or more of neck 
 than thou ambrosial waltz , when first the moon 
 beheld thee twirling to a saxon tune 

he scampered to the bushes far away 
 the shepherd called the ploughman to the fray 
 the ploughman wished he had a gun to shoot 
 the old dog barked and followed the pursuit 
 the shepherd threw his hook and tottered past 
 the ploughman ran but none could go so fast 
 the woodman threw his faggot from the way 
 and ceased to chop and wondered at the fray 
 but when he saw the dog and heard the cry 
 he threw his hatchet — but the fox was bye 
 the shepherd broke his hook and lost the skin 
 he found a badger hole and bolted in 
 they tried to dig , but , safe from danger 's way 
 he lived to chase the hounds another day 

of all the causes which conspire to blind 
 man 's erring judgment , and misguide the mind 
 what the weak head with strongest bias rules 
 is pride , the never failing vice of fools 
 whatever nature has in worth denied 
 she gives in large recruits of needless pride 
 for as in bodies , thus in souls , we find 
 what wants in blood and spirits , swell 'd with wind 
 pride , where wit fails , steps in to our defence 
 and fills up all the mighty void of sense 
 if once right reason drives that cloud away 
 truth breaks upon us with resistless day 
 trust not yourself ; but your defects to know 
 make use of every friend — and every foe 

down in the redwood canyons cool and deep 
 the shadows of the forest ever sleep 
 the odorous redwoods , wet with fog and dew 
 touch with the bay and mingle with the yew 
 under the firs the red madrona shines 
 the graceful tan oaks , fairest of them all 
 lean lovingly unto the sturdy pines 
 in whose far tops the birds of passage call 
 here , where the forest shadows ever sleep 
 the mountain lily lifts its chalice white 
 the myriad ferns hang draperies soft and white 
 thick on each mossy bank and watered steep 
 where slender deer tread softly in the night 
 down in the redwood canyons dark and deep 

the fairest flowers that decked the earth 
 into a nosegay , with wise choice combined 
 thus the first art from nature had its birth 
 into a garland then were nosegays twined 
 and from the works that mortal hands had made 
 a second , nobler art was now displayed 
 the child of beauty , self sufficient now 
 that issued from your hands to perfect day 
 loses the chaplet that adorned its brow 
 soon as reality asserts its sway 
 the column , yielding to proportion 's chains 
 must with its sisters join in friendly link 
 the hero in the hero band must sink 
 the muses ’ harp peals forth its tuneful strains

“ i , if i perish , perish ” — esther spake 
 and bride of life or death she made her fair 
 in all the lustre of her perfumed hair 
 and smiles that kindle longing but to slake 
 she put on pomp of loveliness , to take 
 her husband through his eyes at unaware 
 she spread abroad her beauty for a snare 
 harmless as doves and subtle as a snake 
 she trapped him with one mesh of silken hair 
 she vanquished him by wisdom of her wit 
 and built her people 's house that it should stand 
 if i might take my life so in my hand 
 and for my love to love put up my prayer 
 and for love 's sake by love be granted it 

“ a just reproof , ye peers ! your rage restrain

when i consider how my light is spent 
 ere half my days , in this dark world and wide 
 and that one talent which is death to hide 
 lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent

 my true account , lest he returning chide 
 “ doth god exact day labor , light denied

she , by her neighbour , was received , we 're told 
 ‘ mid costly furniture and burnished gold

 when all attracting he would fain be found 
 the best of wines ; each dish considered rare 
 the gods themselves received not better fare 
 till then , alaciel ne'er had tasted wine 
 her faith forbade a liquor so divine 
 and , unacquainted with the potent juice

 both fraught with danger to the beauteous fair 
 whose charms should guarded be with ev'ry care 

thousands of thousands of hushed years ago 
 out on the edge of chaos , all alone 
 i stood on peaks of vapor , high upthrown 
 above a sea that knew nor ebb nor flow 
 nor any motion won of winds that blow 
 nor any sound of watery wail or moan 
 nor lisp of wave , nor wandering undertone 
 of any tide lost in the night below 
 so still it was , i mind me , as i laid 
 my thirsty ear against mine own faint sigh 
 to drink of that , i sipped it , half afraid 
 ‘ twas but the ghost of a dead voice spilled by 
 the one starved star that tottered through the shade 
 and came tiptoeing toward me down the sky 

who shall invoke her , who shall be her priest 
 with single rites the common debt to pay 
 on some green headland fronting to the east 
 our fairest boy shall kneel at break of day 
 naked , uplifting in a laden tray 
 new milk and honey and sweet tinctured wine 
 not without twigs of clustering apple spray 
 to wreath a garland for our lady 's shrine 
 the morning planet poised above the sea 
 shall drop sweet influence through her drowsing lid 
 dew drenched , his delicate virginity 
 shall scarce disturb the flowers he kneels amid 
 that , waked so lightly , shall lift up their eyes 
 cushion his knees , and nod between his thighs 

can it be right to give what i can give 
 to let thee sit beneath the fall of tears 
 as salt as mine , and hear the sighing years 
 re sighing on my lips renunciative 
 through those infrequent smiles which fail to live 
 for all thy adjurations ? o my fears 
 that this can scarce be right ! we are not peers 
 so to be lovers ; and i own , and grieve 
 that givers of such gifts as mine are , must 
 be counted with the ungenerous . out , alas 
 i will not soil thy purple with my dust 
 nor breathe my poison on thy venice glass 
 nor give thee any love — which were unjust 
 beloved , i only love thee ! let it pass 

there was a cry of terror in the hall 
 of peru 's monarch , and a startling call 
 but no reply — iola sure was gone 
 yet none knew why or whither she had flown 
 her inca father put his crown aside 
 and filled the temple with loud prayer — a tide 
 of lamentation rolled along the fair 
 and blooming realm ; heaven wore a dim despair 
 she ne'er was found ; but how or when she died 
 none knew ; by her own hand ; or if she cried 
 vainly , in wild beasts ’ clutch ;— but ne'er before 
 din wail so wild resound along the shore 
 of fair peru ; her father lived not long 
 after this chord was snapped in his life 's song 

meanwhile the new companions past away 
 far o'er the long backs of the bushless downs 
 to where sir lancelot knew there lived a knight 
 not far from camelot , now for forty years 
 a hermit , who had prayed , laboured and prayed 
 and ever labouring had scooped himself 
 in the white rock a chapel and a hall 
 on massive columns , like a shorecliff cave 
 and cells and chambers : all were fair and dry 
 the green light from the meadows underneath 
 struck up and lived along the milky roofs 
 and in the meadows tremulous aspen trees 
 and poplars made a noise of falling showers 
 and thither wending there that night they bode 

my heart was heavy , for its trust had been 
 abused , its kindness answered with foul wrong 
 so , turning gloomily from my fellow men 
 one summer sabbath day i strolled among 
 the green mounds of the village burial place 
 where , pondering how all human love and hate 
 find one sad level ; and how , soon or late 
 wronged and wrongdoer , each with meekened face 
 and cold hands folded over a still heart 
 pass the green threshold of our common grave 
 whither all footsteps tend , whence none depart 
 awed for myself , and pitying my race 
 our common sorrow , like a nighty wave 
 swept all my pride away , and trembling i forgave 

there shone a comet , and it was full west 
 my thoughts presag è d what it did portend 
 i found it threatened to my heart unrest 
 and might in time my joys and comfort end 
 i further sought and found it was a sun 
 which day nor night did never use to set 
 it constant stood when heavens did restless run 
 and did their virtues and their forces let 
 the world did muse and wonder what it meant 
 a sun to shine and in the west to rise 
 to search the truth , i strength and spirits spent 
 at length i found it was my licia 's eyes 
 now never after soul shall live in dark 
 that hath the hap this western sun to mark 

the nurse sleeps sweetly , hired to watch the sick 
 whom snoring she disturbs . as sweetly he 
 who quits the coach box at the midnight hour 
 to sleep within the carriage more secure 
 his legs depending at the open door 
 sweet sleep enjoys the curate in his desk 
 the tedious rector drawling o'er his head 
 and sweet the clerk below ; but neither sleep 
 of lazy nurse , who snores the sick man dead 
 nor his who quits the box at midnight hour 
 to slumber in the carriage more secure 
 nor sleep enjoyed by curate in his desk 
 nor yet the dozings of the clerk are sweet 
 compared with the repose the sofa yields 

we soon approach 'd it . o thou lombard spirit 
 how didst thou stand , in high abstracted mood 
 scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes 
 it spoke not aught , but let us onward pass 
 eyeing us as a lion on his watch 
 but virgil with entreaty mild advanc 'd 
 requesting it to show the best ascent 
 it answer to his question none return 'd 
 but of our country and our kind of life 
 demanded . when my courteous guide began 
 “ mantua , ” the solitary shadow quick 
 rose towards us from the place in which it stood 
 and cry 'd , “ mantuan ! i am thy countryman 
 sordello . ” each the other then embrac 'd 

the wind was soft before the sunset fled 
 now , while the cloud enshrouded corpse of day 
 is lowered along a red funereal way 
 down to the dark that knows not white from red 
 a clear sheer breeze against the night makes head 
 serene , but sure of life as ere a ray 
 springs , or the dusk of dawn knows red from grey 
 being as a soul that knows not quick from dead 
 from far beyond the sunset , far above 
 full toward the starry soundless east it blows 
 bright as a child 's breath breathing on a rose 
 smooth to the sense as plume of any dove 
 till more and more as darkness grows and glows 
 silence and night seem likest life and love 

unlike are we , unlike , o princely heart 
 unlike our uses and our destinies 
 our ministering two angels look surprise 
 on one another , as they strike athwart 
 their wings in passing . thou , bethink thee , art 
 a guest for queens to social pageantries 
 with gages from a hundred brighter eyes 
 than tears even can make mine , to play thy part 
 of chief musician . what hast thou to do 
 with looking from the lattice lights at me 
 a poor , tired , wandering singer , singing through 
 the dark , and leaning up a cypress tree 
 the chrism is on thine head ,— on mine , the dew 
 and death must dig the level where these agree 

“ such are the men who , with instinctive dread 
 whenever freedom lifts her drooping head 
 make prophet tripods of their office stools 
 and scare the nurseries and the village schools 
 with dire presage of ruin grim and great 
 a broken union and a foundered state 
 such are the patriots , self bound to the stake 
 of office , martyrs for their country 's sake 
 who fill themselves the hungry jaws of fate 
 and by their loss of manhood save the state 
 in the wide gulf themselves like cortius throw 
 and test the virtues of cohesive dough 
 as tropic monkeys , linking heads and tails 
 bridge o'er some torrent of ecuador 's vales 

“ from these dire shores our rapid course we held 
 auspicious gales the flying canvas swell 'd 
 and joy 's faint sunshine kindled in my eyes 
 as the last mountain mingled with the skies 
 when , by conflicting winds together driven 
 a night of clouds involved the starless heaven 
 fierce and more fierce th ’ increasing tempest blew 
 the thunder rattled , and the lightning flew 
 soon , borne at random o'er the watery way 
 the yawning rocks our guideless ship betray 
 my shrieking comrades sink .— some power unseen 
 preserved me , trembling , thro ’ the deathful scene 
 i rode th ’ opposing waves , and from the steep 
 beheld the vessel plunge into the flashing deep
